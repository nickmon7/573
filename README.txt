Deliverables 4 - README

In order to run all programs together, run condor_submit D3.cmd

Type "python extract.py" and "python preprocess.py" in the src folder

To implement rouge with our system - 


We wrote a shell script to run rouge, "run_rouge.sh", which is located in our src directory 
on our repository on patas.

/workspace/ling573_sp_2016/nickmon_calderma_kwlabuda/src

This directory contains both our modified configuration file for the rouge execution (configFile.xml)
as well as run_rouge.sh.
