To implement rouge with our system - 


We wrote a shell script to run rouge, "run_rouge.sh", which is located in our src directory 
on our repository on patas.

/workspace/ling573_sp_2016/nickmon_calderma_kwlabuda/src

This directory contains both our modified configuration file for the rouge execution (configFile.xml)
as well as run_rouge.sh.
