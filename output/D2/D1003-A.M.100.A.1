The Qinling panda has been identified as a sub-species of the giant panda that mainly resides in southwestern Sichuan province. By the end of 2004, arrow bamboo, the favorite food of giants, had blossomed on 7,420 hectares at the Baishuijiang State Nature Reserve in southern Gansu Province, a major habitat of pandas in China, according to a recent survey conducted by the nature reserve administration. Giant pandas are said to have been around during the time of dinosaurs and regarded as a "national gem" of China.
