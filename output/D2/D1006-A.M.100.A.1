"There's no evidence we're aware of the other Cox-2 drugs have similar effects, but we don't really have studies that are long enough (to know)," Miller said. That means Vioxx results cannot automatically be extended to Celebrex and Bextra, which are in the Cox-2 classification with Vioxx but are not identical to it. Their doctors can prescribe other Cox-2 inhibitors, or try drugs such as ibuprofen. The painkillers known as COX-2 inhibitors, which include Bextra and Vioxx, have been widely prescribed to people suffering with arthritis.
