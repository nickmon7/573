Several factors contribute to the higher prevalence of obesity in adult women, Al-Awadi said.
Obesity is number one health threat associated with nutrition in Kuwait, Director of Food and Nutrition Department of the Ministry of health Fawzia Al-Awadi said in a recent study.
Al-Awadi noted that "it has been shown that obesity shortens life which is mainly due to cardiovascular and cerebro-vascular diseases, constituting an additional risk to overweight patients." The nutritionist also said a large percentage of Kuwaiti children are suffering from malnutrition due to bad feeding habits that cause iron deficiency anemia.
