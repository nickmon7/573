Obesity is number one health threat associated with nutrition in Kuwait, Director of Food and Nutrition Department of the Ministry of health Fawzia Al-Awadi said in a recent study. Several factors contribute to the higher prevalence of obesity in adult women, Al-Awadi said. These factors include repeated pregnancies, rapid decline in breast feeding, an early introduction to bottle feeding as well as poor eating habits. Al-Awadi noted that "it has been shown that obesity shortens life which is mainly due to cardiovascular and cerebro-vascular diseases, constituting an additional risk to overweight patients."
