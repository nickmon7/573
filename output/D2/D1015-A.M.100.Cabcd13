Chinese government has always attached great importance to the protection of this area. It first set up a tropical primary forest protection zone in the area in 1951. A national forest garden was established there in 1992, and in 1993, Hainan provincial government decided to stop commercial tree felling in the area.  Many international and foreign organizations have paid close attention to the protection of gibbons. They sent teams to conduct on-the-spot studies, established research centers, provide funds and publish information to generate world wide attention to their plight.
