BRUNSWICK, Ga._A voluntary evacuation of heavily-populated barrier islands and low-lying areas east of Ga.
Even though the storm was expected to turn before making a landfall in that area, its hurricane-force wind could still rake the coast by the middle of the week.
``This would send hurricane-force winds over much of Florida, depending on its exact track,'' Kimberlain said.
By comparison, Floyd's hurricane-force wind extended 105 miles north and east of its center, said Todd Kimberlain, a forecaster at the hurricane center.
Floyd had top sustained wind today of nearly 155 mph.
