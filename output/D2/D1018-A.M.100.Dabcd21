"They did not know what was going on," she said. "We were there on a mission." The fourth person in custody, Steve Gregory Croes, 26, played music on a tourist party barge called the "Tattoo," but none of the Mountain Brook teens were known to have gone on the boat, Bearman said. An employer of Croes said the disc jockey knew one of the Surinamese brothers through an Internet cafe. "We have to wait for the investigation to finish," she said. A fourth suspect, the disc jockey from a party boat, is also in custody.
