Full90 does not claim that its headgear prevent concussions.
Both the Temecula and De Anza clubs are sponsored by Full90.

Authorities said they issued over 520 additional tickets by midday Tuesday.
Fashion aside, Ross Paule, a midfielder for the Columbus Crew of Major League Soccer, wore a Full90 headgear for a dozen games in the recently completed season, seeking some security after suffering three earlier concussions.
