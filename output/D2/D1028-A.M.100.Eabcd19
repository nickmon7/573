Prosecutors have said they hope to decide before January whether to seek the death penalty, which Kaczynski could also face for the two California bombing deaths. Prosecutors say they expect to take up to four weeks to present evidence showing that Kaczynski is the UNABOMber.  Kaczynski, the former Berkeley mathematics professor, has pleaded innocent to four Unabomber attacks that killed two people in Sacramento. Kacznski is expected to be returned to Sacramento for his trial on November 12. He is charged in four bombings that killed two men and wounded two others.
