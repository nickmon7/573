Opposition presidential candidate Kim Dae-jung defeated governing party candidate Lee Hoi-chang in the 1997 election.
Rampant spy agency wiretapping was believed to have ended after Kim Dae-jung, who won the 1997 election, ordered the practice terminated.
He has come under intense pressure to step down over a purportedly wiretapped conversation in which he is said to have discussed a slush fund for candidates in the 1997 election.
