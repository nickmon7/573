Between 1852 and 1929, one intersex frog was found in the 84 collected.
Toxicologists and veterinarians at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, led by Amy Reeder, examined the reproductive organs of 814 cricket frogs collected in Illinois between 1852 and 2001 and stored at natural history museums.
Her husband had noticed the frog weeks earlier outside their porch door, telling her it resembled "one of those weird African frogs." Butler snapped a photo of it and searched the Internet trying to identify it.
