Al Donner, an assistant field supervisor in Fish and Wildlife's Sacramento office, said federal officials are trying to ``be sensitive to the interests of all affected parties'' in the tiger salamander case, including developers, landowners and environmentalists, ``while working to ensure the survival of the species.'' Four years ago the federal government launched a national program to research and monitor the state of amphibians in the United States, and it now devotes $4 million a year to identify threats to amphibians nationwide. Between 1852 and 1929, one intersex frog was found in the 84 collected.
