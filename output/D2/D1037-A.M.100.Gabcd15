From the dock, Jason Ruth, a worker at Harris', began culling the pile with an expert's eye, selecting those to keep and shuck and those to return to the bay. Taking handfuls at a time, Ruth flung the oysters back into the water. "See," he said, picking up one in a fluid motion and knocking it with a quick tap against the pile, making a hollow thunk. "There's nothing there. It's dead. Gone." The shell landed back in the water with a splash.
