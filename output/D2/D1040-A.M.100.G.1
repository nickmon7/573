Married and pregnant with her own child, Blake-Hurwitz said that when she first met Rosie, the child was a 4-month-old who was withdrawn, kept folding herself into a fetal position and didn't make eye contact with anyone.
Blake-Hurwitz said that's what her ex-husband may have believed, but it was not her reason for the annulment.
Blake-Hurwitz, a psychology professor, said she immediately arranged for a friend to take Rosie to a pediatrician.
