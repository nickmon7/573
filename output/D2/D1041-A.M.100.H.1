The scientists found that reefs in Panama and Kenya, which had experienced unusually high water temperatures, had high proportions of a heat-tolerant strain called symbiont D.
For example, she said, it could be that heat-tolerant algae strains devote more of their energy to reproducing and less to providing sustenance to their coral hosts.
Some reefs, however, are proving surprisingly resilient, researchers say, not because of qualities of the corals, but because of heat-tolerant algae that live with them.
But the new research, led by Baker, suggests that heat-tolerant algae may move in to replace strains lost in bleaching events.
