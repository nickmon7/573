Baker said these findings, reported in the journal Nature in August, suggested that when corals lost algae in a bleaching event, heat-tolerant algae could move in to replace them. For example, she said, it could be that heat-tolerant algae strains devote more of their energy to reproducing and less to providing sustenance to their coral hosts. The scientists found that reefs in Panama and Kenya, which had experienced unusually high water temperatures, had high proportions of a heat-tolerant strain called symbiont D.
