NEW YORK _ The Rev. _ The FBI dispatched a team of ballistic experts from Washington who spent days making measurements of the crime scene and traced bullet trajectories with lasers. What happened next is sure to be the subject of much debate at the future criminal trial of the four officers. The city's autopsy indicates that one shot struck Diallo just above the heel and traveled up the calf before lodging behind the knee, people who reviewed the report have said. McMellon and Carroll got out of their maroon Ford Taurus and approached Diallo on the stoop.
