Flowering arrow bamboo is threatening a colony of endangered giant pandas in China but experts have come up with a plan to save them, state media said Monday.
This has meant there is little for pandas to eat in Gansu's Baishuijiang nature park.
Located in the giant panda breeding lab, the bank will help researchers answer questions such as how many blood types pandas have and whether they reject blood transfusions, centre sources said.
