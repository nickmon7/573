This is a result of two provincial projects, the natural forest protection and cultivated land reforestation, said Yang Dongsheng, head of the provincial forestry department. Wang said, Shaanxi has so far established 13 giant pandas protection zones and nature reserves focused on pandas' habitats. The discovery of panda traces in Fengxian County, northwest China's Shaanxi Province, demonstrates that the habitat of the rare creatures is expanding in this inland province, an official with the Shaanxi Provincial Forestry Bureau said.
