Because strict preventive measures have been taken for a long period, Zhao said, there has been no bird flu epidemic in recent years among Shenzhen's 168 chicken runs and 38 pigeon farms.
The virus, known to cause "bird influenza" among chickens, apparently has been transferred to humans in Hong Kong.
Seven people have been infected so far, with two dead and two in critical conditions.
Moreover, two more cases were classified as "suspected" by the Department of Health, increasing to nine the total number of H5N1 cases in human, Chan said.
