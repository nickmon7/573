Kiril Kirov, director of the government's veterinary service, told the newspaper 168 hours that "the import and the usage of the Dutch test is a violation of EU requirements". According to statistics released by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, testing for mad cow disease from June 1 to Oct. 17 on 85,812 cows came up negative, indicating that there is very little chance that American cows have mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy. Japan, the largest export market for US beef, is among about three dozen countries that halted US beef imports after mad cow disease was discovered there in December 2003. The government declined to identify the man or the hospital treating him. The money would come from the euro188 million (US$235 million) set aside in 2005 to combat animal diseases in the EU.
