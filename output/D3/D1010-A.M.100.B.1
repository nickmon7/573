Kiril Kirov, director of the government's veterinary service, told the newspaper 168 hours that "the import and the usage of the Dutch test is a violation of EU requirements". In June 2004 the country switched to a Dutch test not yet recognised by the commission's veterinary control service. Cases have also been detected in the United States and Canada. The cow was born in Shikaoi, north Japan's Hokkaido region, in October 2000, and was checked for mad cow disease after it died, the ministry said. The federal government is increasing the number of cattle tested to 30,000 in 2005 and subsequent years.
