MYSTERY REMAINS OVER DOOMED PLANE Though official sources suspected that an apparently technical problem could have caused the tragedy, accident investigators still faced a mystery over the last minutes of the doomed plane.
He was wearing an oxygen mask, apparently unconscious, Greece's government spokesman, Theodore Roussopoulos, said after a marathon crisis meeting led by the Greek prime minister.
Flight 522 left the Larnaka airport at 9 a.m. carrying 115 passengers and six crew members.
