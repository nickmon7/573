All five factions of the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), the country's highest legislative body, agreed to add a provision in a decree on clean governance, preventing centralization of power, corruption, collusion and nepotism. But they failed to reach the target point because of tight security precautions at various intersections that lead to the spot, official Antara News Agency reported.
