Aruban authorities have defended their investigation, saying police work takes time. "How many children have gone missing in the United States in the last month? Investigators were refusing to say if they thought Holloway was dead. "She had been missing less than 24 hours and we had all three names and addresses, so it's just disappointing that they (authorities) weren't able to move faster," Jody Bearman, who organized the graduation trip and went to Aruba to help in the search, said in an interview with the AP on Friday. A fourth man detained in the case was to appear before a judge Monday, said Attorney General spokeswoman Mariaine Croes.
