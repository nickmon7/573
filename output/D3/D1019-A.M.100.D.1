The hostages have been forced to stay in unprotected shacks while the rebels have taken refuge in bunkers, a hostage told ABS-CBN television in an interview by cellular telephone. Meanwhile, Malaysian Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar also held a news conference earlier Monday on the incident, saying that all the 20 people taken hostage by armed pirates were safe. Prior to the rebel announcement, Col. Ernesto de Guzman, chief of staff of the Philippine military's Southern Command, said officials were trying to determine whether there was a connection with the hostage situation on the southern Philippine island of Basilan, about 275 miles northeast of Semporna, the port from which tourists take boats for Sipadan. ''This has never happened here before, so I don't think there are any Malaysians involved,'' in the hostage taking, Chong said. He said the ground troops were pursuing fleeing rebels, and the troops next plan to advance to the main stronghold further up the mountain, he said.
