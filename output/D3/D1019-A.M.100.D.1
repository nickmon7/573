KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- Six masked assailants have taken more than 20 people, including Americans and Europeans, hostage on a remote resort island in eastern Malaysia, police said Monday. Prior to the rebel announcement, Col. Ernesto de Guzman, chief of staff of the Philippine military's Southern Command, said officials were trying to determine whether there was a connection with the hostage situation on the southern Philippine island of Basilan, about 275 miles northeast of Semporna, the port from which tourists take boats for Sipadan. Chong Kah Kiat, tourism minister for Sabah, said he was concerned that the attack would scare off the 400,000 tourists who visit Sabah beaches and rain forests every year. The hostages have been forced to stay in unprotected shacks while the rebels have taken refuge in bunkers, a hostage told ABS-CBN television in an interview by cellular telephone. ''This has never happened here before, so I don't think there are any Malaysians involved,'' in the hostage taking, Chong said.
