Aside from causing stillbirths and miscarriages, listeriosis also can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in people with weakened immune systems: infants, the elderly or patients with chronic diseases, HIV infection or undergoing cancer chemotherapy. Ohio has had the largest number of cases, 13. People with AIDS are almost 300 times more likely to get listeriosis than people with normal immune systems. Healthy people usually can fight off the bacterium with no more than flu-like symptoms. But it is a big risk to people 75 and older, people with compromised immune systems, pregnant women and the very young.
