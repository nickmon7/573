BC-STEIN (St. Petersburg) -- A Q&amp;A with the visiting Ben Stein, economist/Nixon White House protege/actor/author/political commentator. Lafave's ex-husband, Owen Lafave, said Wednesday that she was being treated for mental problems when she committed the crime, but it was a double standard that she avoided prison. He said he and Lafave, a newlywed at the time, got to know each other on their way back from a class trip to SeaWorld Orlando in May 2004. Now classified as a sex offender, the former teacher can no longer work with or near children and cannot live within 1,000 feet of a school, church or playground. By TOM JONES.
