Conservation Minister Chris Carter told NZPA, a news agency, that he understands the Japanese want to add 80 of each of hampback and fin whales to its legal kill lists. Japan, where whale meat is part of culinary culture, reluctantly halted commercial whaling in line with an IWC moratorium in 1986, but the next year resumed catches under a loophole that allows "scientific research whaling". "We've actually got to show some muscle here," she added. An animal rights group on Friday lost a bid to sue a Japanese whaling company for allegedly killing hundreds of whales inside an Australian whale sanctuary. The opposition Labor Party assailed the government's intervention in the case, which coincides with efforts by Japan to gain permission from the International Whaling Commission (IWC) to double the number of whales it can kill each year.
