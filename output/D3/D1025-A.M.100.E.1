" While the National Wildlife Federation is backing the delisting of the grizzly bear, other environmental groups including the Sierra Club and the Natural Resource Defense Council are opposed and threaten to sue the federal government to block the move. The only other large population of grizzlies in the United States is in and around Glacier National Park. Yet the tiny seeds -- embedded in neat, brown cones -- can make up more than half of a grizzly's pre-hibernation diet, one Canadian Journal of Zoology study shows. They are now in places they haven't been in 80 or 100 years. Yellowstone boasts the largest grizzly population in the lower 48 states, though a few smaller groups live in areas such as the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem near Canada, Montana's Cabinet Yaak wilderness and Idaho's Selkirk Mountains.
