"We're saying we'll be able to respond to changes to make sure the bear's OK." In late summer and fall, grizzly bears follow an urge to gorge in order to store enough fat to survive hibernation, a condition called hyperphagy.
Moreover, new management plans might allow hunting of the bears outside the park.
Yet the tiny seeds -- embedded in neat, brown cones -- can make up more than half of a grizzly's pre-hibernation diet, one Canadian Journal of Zoology study shows.
They are now in places they haven't been in 80 or 100 years.
