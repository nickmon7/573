U.S. District Court Judge Garland Burrell Jr. has ordered that jurors' identities in the Sacramento trial be kept secret, but said they won't be sequestered.
Unabomber suspect Theodore J. Kaczynski pleaded innocent today via video to charges he sent the mail bomb killing an advertising executive exactly two years ago.
The UNABOMber trial is getting under way today with jury selection in Sacramento, California.
Denvir and Clarke want prospective jurors to complete detailed questionnaires about their knowledge of the case and their feelings about the death penalty, which the government is seeking against Kaczynski.
