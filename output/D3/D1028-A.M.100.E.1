Prosecutors have said they hope to decide before January whether to seek the death penalty, which Kaczynski could also face for the two California bombing deaths. Debevoise also heard arguments on a defense request to transfer the New Jersey case to Sacramento, where a November trial date has been set. The suspect, Theodore Kaczynski, a 55-year-old former University of California math instructor, is charged with four of the 16 attacks attributed to the Unabomber, two of which are fatal. The mail bomb terrorist killed three people and injured 23 others in 18 years.
