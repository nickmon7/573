The death toll from Saturday's bomb blast remained at 39, Yaqub said, dismissing local media reports that more bodies had been discovered at the scene.
More than 3,000 government employees and their families escaped Saturday in vehicles under paramilitary escort from Dera Bugti after a 16-hour battle in the town last week.
Tribal chief Nawab Akbar Bugti vowed to fight the government, saying hundreds of his supporters were ready to face the security forces.
