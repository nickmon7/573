"The ceasefire is still holding," head of the Interior Ministry's National Crisis Management Cell, Brigadier Javed Cheema, told AFP on Friday. Lasi said they had dug more trenches about 500 to 1,000 meters (yards) from the base. Registration of a case is seen as the first step by the government before arresting someone wanted for wrongdoing. Eight soldiers were killed and 23 injured in fierce desert gunbattles with tribal rebels in Pakistan's southwestern province of Baluchistan, officials said Friday. The province has been gripped by a sporadic tribal revolt for more than a year but the violence surged after the January rape of a 32 year-old doctor at Pakistan's largest gas field at Sui in Baluchistan.
