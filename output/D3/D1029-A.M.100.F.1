The death toll from Saturday's bomb blast remained at 39, Yaqub said, dismissing local media reports that more bodies had been discovered at the scene. Lasi said they had dug more trenches about 500 to 1,000 meters (yards) from the base. Fighting lasted all day Thursday after the heavily-armed clansmen, who want more autonomy and increased benefits from the area's natural resources, ambushed a convoy of paramilitary Frontier Corps soldiers, officials said.
