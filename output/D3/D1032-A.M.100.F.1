The gas leak, which led to the evacuation of 180 workers from the floating Snorre A platform located northwest of the port city of Bergen, was contained Monday afternoon, nearly 18 hours after it was reported, Statoil spokesman Oeivind Reinertsen said. Statoil ASA said Tuesday it expects to restart its Snorre A offshore petroleum platform later this week, almost a month after a natural gas leak shut down operations. Norway's oil production has been reduced by some 205,000 barrels per day. Statoil has proposed resuming full production on Vigdis (75,000 bpd), and partial production on Snorre A, by pumping up oil through underwater extensions while repairs continue on the platform itself. That closure has slashed Norway's oil production by an additional 140,000 bpd.
