Norwegian oil group Statoil said on Tuesday that it had yet to resume production on two of its platforms after a gas leak forced it to shut down operations earlier this week, cutting Norway's total oil output by 200,000 barrels per day. The 36 workers aboard the platform pumped heavy drilling mud into the leaking injection well. That closure has slashed Norway's oil production by an additional 140,000 bpd. Statoil has proposed resuming full production on Vigdis (75,000 bpd), and partial production on Snorre A, by pumping up oil through underwater extensions while repairs continue on the platform itself. Bad weather was in part blamed for Statoil ASA being unable to restart 205,000 barrels per day of production from two other fields, Snorre and Vigdis, which were shut down after a Nov. 28 natural gas leak.
