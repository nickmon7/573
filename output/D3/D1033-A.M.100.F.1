Kim "never received any report of such illegal activities" during his presidency, Choi Gyung-hwan, Kim's secretary, said in a statement. Prosecutors meanwhile raided the house of a former head of the spy agency, the National Intelligence Service (NIS), late Thursday and seized documents and computer discs believed to be related to the unlawful bugging. Hong came under pressure to resign as suspicions arose that he might have acted as an intermediary between the country's largest conglomerate Samsung and politicians and handed out Samsung's slush funds to presidential candidates in 1997. Roh's office indicated it may take time before Hong officially leaves his post because of "pending issues" that need to be taken care of. The influential civic group also called for criminal charges against former government officials suspected of having received bribes from Samsung.
