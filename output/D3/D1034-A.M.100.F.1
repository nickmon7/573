Cairns Frog Hospital in northern Queensland state, which at times had as many as 200 sick amphibians in its care, has had to close down because of unsustainable costs, founder Deborah Pergolotti told AFP on Friday. Between 1852 and 1929, one intersex frog was found in the 84 collected. Because we know so little about them, we get as much lab work done as we can afford," Pergolotti said. " Since 1993, Yanacocha has operated an open pit mine on a plateau about 13,000 feet (3,940 meters) above sea level, nine miles (15 kilometers) from Cajamarca, a small Spanish colonial city 350 miles (560 kilometers) north of Lima. "If people encounter them, they can kill them and send us the actual animal or they can take photos," Jensen said.
