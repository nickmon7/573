Speaking at a news conference, Major said the eruption appeared to have punched a hole about 100 feet in diameter in the glacial ice that covers part of the mountain's horseshoe-shaped dome.
Gas-rich magma is more likely to erupt explosively.

The eruption was so short-lived that the ash appeared to pose no threat to anyone.
