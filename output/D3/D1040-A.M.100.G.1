Blake, a two-time Emmy Award winner, ``overestimated his acting abilities,'' said Deputy Los Angeles County District Attorney Shellie L. Samuels during her three-hour closing argument. Prosecutors argued that Blake's account didn't add up because nobody saw him retrieve the gun from the restaurant, but Schwartzbach said the layout of the restaurant would have made it easy for Blake to slip in, retrieve the gun and leave. "All sides have rested and the case is now concluded," Judge Darlene Schempp told the jury Friday. The lawyer also ridiculed the idea that Blake would ask these aging stuntmen -- one who had recently had a heart attack and they other missing a kidney -- to kill Bakley. That they met?
