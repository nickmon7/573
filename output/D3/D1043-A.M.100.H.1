Hariri's sister, Bahia, chairs the Education Committee in the Lebanese Parliament. Among foreign dignitaries at the funeral were EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana, US Assistant Secretary of State William Burns and Arab League Secretary-General Amr Moussa as well as other Arab and European ministers. Syria has been under international pressure to withdraw its troops from Lebanon and not to interfere in Lebanon's internal affairs. Ambulances carrying the coffin of Hariri and six of his bodyguards and a paramedic who were also killed in the blast, were brought to a halt at the edge of the square. Every Syrian who comes to Beirut feels as if he has come from a smoke-filled room to a place with fresh air.
