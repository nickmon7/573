Japan has provided some 500 million US dollar fund for tsunami- affected countries including Indonesia, the Maldives and Sri Lanka. Indonesia's official earthquake and tsunami death toll rose by more than 100 people Wednesday to 94,200, the health ministry said. The Chinese team arrived in Medan, capital of North Sumatra, Indonesia, at 05:10 a.m. local time by a chartered plane. A Chinese quake rescue team arrived in tsunami-ravaged Indonesia early Friday to help emergency aid efforts there. The two batches of relief goods, worth 21.63 million yuan (2.62 million US dollars), are mainly tents, blankets, sheets and food that are badly needed by the people affected by the tsunami.
