A second plane with an additional 16 metric tons (18 short tons) of aid was to depart Monday evening. Indonesia's official earthquake and tsunami death toll rose by more than 100 people Wednesday to 94,200, the health ministry said. An extremely powerful earthquake and the tsunami that followed devastated many parts of North Sumatra and Aceh on Dec. 26 last year, killing more than 100,000 people there. The Chinese team arrived in Medan, capital of North Sumatra, Indonesia, at 05:10 a.m. local time by a chartered plane. Planes from this Central Asian nation are also helping deliver aid from Denmark and Switzerland, the Foreign Ministry said.
