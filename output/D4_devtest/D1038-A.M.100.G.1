Gas-rich magma is more likely to erupt explosively.
The instrument's readings showed the site of the eruption was not particularly hot indicating the eruption of steam and ash had originated from at least several hundred feet underground.
The earthquakes quit after the eruption, said University of Washington seismologist Tony Qamar.
Although geologists said the probability for another eruption is high predict it would not be anything like that of 1980.
