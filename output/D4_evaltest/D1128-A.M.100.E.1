Taylor was moved out of Freetown and to the premises in The Hague to avoid stirring unrest in strife-prone west Africa.
The rebels looted and torched homes according to Taylor's indictment which covers crimes allegedly committed between January 2002.
Khan stopped meeting Taylor after authorities at the detention block installed video surveillance cameras in the room where the lawyers and Taylor discussed the case.
The trial is expected to start June 4 in The Hague Netherlands.
