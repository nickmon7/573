The government has set up more than 50 reserves, most in the southwest province of Sichuan.
About 100 giant pandas in northwest China's Gansu Province are suffering from hunger because large tracts of arrow bamboo have bloomed and died.
The giant pandas will not eat the bamboo after it blooms and it takes 10 years for a new supply to grow.
Zhang Kerong, director of the Baishuijiang State Nature Preserve, said that the preserve will intervene and help giant pandas find new food source.
Since the 1970s, many pandas in the reserve have died because of food shortages.
