Australia will provide transport for relief supplies and a mobile hospital to Papua New Guinea (PNG) following Friday's tsunami tragedy.
ABC radio, a government-owned corporation, quoted Australian army officials Sunday as saying the death toll could rise to as high as 2,000 people, but that figure could not be confirmed by the Papua New Guinean government.
Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer described the events in PNG as "horrific", saying Australia would do all it could to help PNG cope with the crisis.
