As of October 27, more than 8,600 animals were tested for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), the scientific name for mad cow, the agency said in a news release.
"Although we cannot guarantee your risk of an exposure is absolutely zero, it is immeasurably lower, for example, than other types of potential infections that sometimes occur in a hospital or other clinical surgical settings," he said.
The cow was born in Shikaoi, north Japan's Hokkaido region, in October 2000, and was checked for mad cow disease after it died, the ministry said.
