China and Russia have both pledged to cooperate closely to handle the pollution of the Songhua River in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao here Thursday.
"The two sides are making specific arrangements for opening a hotline for the matter," said Zhang Lijun, deputy director of SEPA.
The Fengman Hydropower Station in the upper reach of Songhua River increased the daily discharge amount from 600 cubic meters per second to 1,000 cubic meters per second starting from 10:00 a.m. Thursday.
