The rebels left Makati after negotiations with military officers and marched back to their barracks with rifles , bazookas , and machine-guns , chanting : `` No surrender , the fight goes on. '' Brigadier-General Arturo Enrile , the government negotiator , said the mutineers had initially demanded Mrs Aquino 's resignation , but eventually `` reason prevailed over whatever political or ideoligical convictions they had. '' Gen Enrile went on : `` I told them they would be treated fairly , justly and humanely but they must be man enough to take the consequences of their actions. '' At the camp , the rebel troops were welcomed with a banner that read : `` Welcome home. '' They shook hands and embraced government soldiers .
