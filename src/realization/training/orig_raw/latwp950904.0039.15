`` I do n't think I ever felt as detested as when I joined the defense team of El Sayyid Nosair , '' Kunstler wrote in his 1994 autobiography , `` My Life as a Radical Lawyer. '' `` Because I am Jewish , the criticism against me for defending Nosair was particularly vehement. '' In another unpopular case , Kunstler helped defend Colin Ferguson , a Jamaican immigrant who killed six and wounded 19 others on a Long Island Rail Road commuter train .
