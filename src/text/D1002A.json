			"text":" NEW YORK _ The parents of Amadou Diallo plan to meet with the Bronx district attorney on Wednesday to receive a preview of the criminal charges that the grand jury voted to bring against the four New York City police officers who killed their son seven weeks ago. Diallo's father, Saikou Amad Diallo, arrived here Wednesday from the West African nation of Guinea and said he was anxious to see the officers not only charged, but brought to trial. ``We are waiting for this, for justice,'' he said, ``and we feel strong.'' The mother, Kadiadou Diallo, and two of her children, are expected to arrive at Newark International Airport from Guinea on Thursday morning. She had been expected Tuesday, but had to cancel her flight because the U.S. Embassy in the Guinean capital of Conakry was unexpectedly closed Monday and she was not able to pick up her visas. The parents, who are divorced, were last in New York in early February, when they came to collect their son's body for burial in Guinea and found that his death had set off a storm of political protest that has yet to abate. Diallo, a 22-year-old immigrant who worked as a street peddler in Manhattan and attended computer classes, was shot in the vestibule of his Bronx apartment building Feb. 4. He was unarmed. The four officers fired 41 shots, hitting Diallo 19 times. Bronx District Attorney Robert Johnson plans to meet with the Diallos shortly before 2 p.m., when the grand jury indictments are scheduled to be unsealed in open court. Johnson has refused to confirm reports, based on people familiar with the case, that the officers will be charged with second-degree murder. The Rev. Al Sharpton, who organized the daily protests over the Diallo shooting and is an adviser to the family, also is expected to attend the meeting, said Steven Reed, Johnson's spokesman. Sharpton's National Action Network in Harlem has helped finance the Diallo family's trips to and from New York City. A lawyer representing one of the officers in the shooting, Stuart London, has criticized the delays in unsealing the indictments against the officers, particularly since the grand jury voted on the charges last Thursday. Asked if the timing of the arraignment was scheduled to accommodate the Diallo family's travel plans, Reed said he would not comment. It is not unusual for a prosecutor to brief a victim's family on criminal charges, he added, even in cases far less publicized than the Diallo case. ``It is the district attorney's practice to have families of the deceased hear about grand jury results in advance,'' he said. During their stay in New York City, Diallo's parents will have a packed schedule of meetings and rallies, organized by Sharpton, that will keep them in the spotlight. When they came in February, shortly after their son's killing, they attained near-celebrity status _ trailed by television cameras, greeted by crowds and transported from place to place by motorcade. Friday, both parents are expected to meet with many of the people who were arrested for civil disobedience during protests at Police Headquarters over the last several weeks. Charles Barron, an organizer of the protests, said the Diallos would speak at rallies organized around other high-profile cases in which the police are accused of brutality against young black men. He said they would be taken to U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, for example, where a jury is being selected to hear the case against police officers charged with brutalizing a Haitian immigrant, Abner Louima. The parents, according to Sharpton, will stay in New York City for about 10 days. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani also plans to be in the Bronx on Wednesday. The mayor is scheduled to rename the block in front of the 50th Precinct station house, on Kingsbridge Avenue at West 236th Street. The block will named for Officer Vincent Guidice, who died in May 1996 after he fell on the shards of a broken mirror while responding to a domestic dispute. Outside Bronx Supreme Court on Tuesday, about 400 off-duty police officers chanting ``No Justice, No Police'' and ``Its a Tragedy, Not a Crime'' rallied to show support for the four police officers before their expected arraignment.

			"text":" NEW YORK _ Some of the police officers who shot and killed Amadou Diallo have told associates that their attention was initially drawn to Diallo when they saw him standing on the stoop of a Bronx apartment building and thought they saw him peering into the window of a first-floor apartment, according to people with knowledge of the case. Those officers told associates that they grew more suspicious when two of them got out of their car to question him and he retreated into the vestibule of the building, the people knowledgeable about the case said on Tuesday. The four officers, who are scheduled to be arraigned on criminal charges in state Supreme Court in the Bronx on Wednesday, did not testify about the shooting before the grand jury that heard their case. Diallo, an unarmed man with no criminal history, was killed on Feb. 4 when the four officers fired 41 shots at him, 19 of which hit him. The shooting led to 15 days of protests outside Police Headquarters and reignited the gnawing debate about police in New York City. During the outcry the officers, their lawyers and law-enforcement officials have remained silent about what set off the shooting. But several officers are said to have told associates that the chain of events that led to the fatal shooting of Diallo began when the officers first spotted him and thought that they saw him looking into the window. The four officers _ Edward McMellon, Sean Carroll, Kenneth Boss and Richard Murphy, all in plain clothes _ were driving along Wheeler Avenue in the Soundview section of the Bronx at 12:40 a.m. when they first spotted Diallo pacing on the stoop of No. 1157. The officers did not know it, but it was the building where he lived. McMellon and Carroll got out of their maroon Ford Taurus and approached Diallo on the stoop. McMellon stood to the left and Carroll to the right as they mounted the steps. What happened next is sure to be the subject of much debate at the future criminal trial of the four officers. The four police officers have yet to officially explain their actions. But several officers told associates that after the officers identified themselves and asked to talk to Diallo, he retreated into the building's vestibule and appeared to be trying to reach the inner door, the people with knowledge of the case said. Diallo remained silent during the whole encounter, they said. According to this account, several officers told associates that while Diallo was in the vestibule, he made a move that led them to believe he was armed: he turned to his right, reached into his pocket and pulled something out. It turned out later to be his black wallet. At that point, Carroll yelled, ``Gun!'' the people knowledgeable about the case said. Some of the details were first reported Tuesday in The New York Post. It was unclear from Tuesday's accounts who fired the first shot. As the first gunshots rang out, McMellon fell backwards down the steps and injured his tailbone, causing at least some of his colleagues to believe that he had been hit by return fire, people knowledgeable about the case said. Carroll moved to his right and continued firing, and Murphy and Boss, who were closer to the car, began firing as well, they said. Several of the officers are said to have told associates that they continued firing because Diallo did not fall even after they had unleashed the fusillade. When the officers saw afterward that Diallo was unarmed, the people knowledgeable about the case said, at least one of the officers wept. "

			"text":" NEW YORK (AP) -- Four white police officers were charged with murder Wednesday for killing an unarmed African immigrant in a hail of 41 bullets -- a shooting that has led to months of protests and a painful examination of police tactics and race relations. Officers Kenneth Boss, Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon and Richard Murphy pleaded innocent in a Bronx courtroom to second-degree murder. They could get 25 years to life in prison on the murder charges. Amadou Diallo, a 22-year-old street vendor from Guinea with no criminal record, was shot 19 times Feb. 4 in his vestibule by members of an elite street-crime unit looking for a rape suspect. Through their lawyers, the officers have said they thought Diallo had a gun. The slaying has frayed Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's already strained relationship with the black community, and many have accused him of failing to understand the depth of New Yorkers' anger. Giuliani said Wednesday: ``We should allow the criminal justice system to now operate.'' Judge John P. Collins set bail at $100,000 for each officer, even though District Attorney Robert Johnson had asked that they be held without bail. The officers left the courthouse together shortly after the arraignment. Johnson told the judge: ``On Feb. 4 in the vestibule in his own building, Amadou Diallo stood blameless, unarmed and defenseless when 19 of 41 shots were fired at him, struck him and killed him. ... These four defendants intended to take his life.'' After leaving court, one of the officers, Carroll, shook hands with supporters and said in a quivering voice, ``I want to thank the New York City police officers and the Street Crime Unit for their undaunted support.'' The officers were immediately suspended from their jobs. Marvyn Kornberg, Carroll's lawyer, called the intentional murder count ``ludicrous.'' ``What's the district attorney saying? That they had nothing to do that night but roll up on an individual and attempt to kill him because he's black?'' the lawyer asked. Steven Brounstein, Boss's attorney, said in court that Johnson had ``succumbed to a political agenda. My client is innocent of all charges. There was no crime on February 4.'' In the two months since Diallo was killed, 1,203 people have been arrested in demonstrations over Diallo's death, the alleged police torture of Haitian immigrant Abner Louima in 1997 and the perception that law-abiding minorities are routinely humiliated by police stop-and-search tactics. Off-duty police officers and more than 25 of Diallo's friends and relatives packed the small courtroom for the 45-minute arraignment. About 1,000 demonstrators stood outside the courthouse. Since the slaying, the street-crime unit has been ordered to wear uniforms instead of plainclothes, and 50 slots at the predominantly white division will be reassigned to minority police officers. The case also reflects tension over police attitudes and tactics nationally. Earlier this month, President Clinton said he was worried that recent charges of police misconduct could undermine the fight against crime. The officers in the Diallo case did not testify before the grand jury. Brounstein and Culleton both said their clients began firing because they saw one officer on the ground. McMellon supposedly slipped and fell as he and the other officers confronted Diallo. James Culleton, Murphy's lawyer, said his client ``had a sick feeling inside of him, believing that he was going to be shot, and he reacted.'' Earlier Wednesday, Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Safir attended a tribute to a police officer killed in the line of duty in 1996. Safir called Diallo's death a tragedy but urged critics of the Police Department to ``acknowledge the tragedies that befall our family.'' ``We grieve for Amadou Diallo and the four officers involved and pray they get a fair trial,'' Safir said.

			"headline":"FOUR N.Y. OFFICERS INDICTED IN SHOOTING OF AFRICAN IMMIGRANT",
			"text":" NEW YORK _ The Rev. Al Sharpton stepped to the microphone outside the Bronx County Couthouse and bellowed: ``The police in there have just been charged with murder in the second degree,'' and the crowd of hundreds whooped and cheered. It was the first time ever that a New York City police officer has been indicted for murder, according to prosecutors and police spokesmen, though a few have faced manslaughter charges. The three-count indictment _ two for second-degree murder, one for reckless endangerment _ applied to all four of the white officers who fired 41 bullets at African immigrant Amadou Diallo in the wee hours of Feb. 4, as he stood, unarmed, in the vestibule of his Bronx apartment building. The officers _ Kenneth Boss, Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon, and Richard Murphy _ pleaded not guilty to the charges. State Supreme Court Judge John P. Collins set bail at $100,000 for each officer, which was expected to be met. Police commissioner Howard Safir suspended the officers from the force immediately after announcement of the indictment, which was returned by a grand jury last week but officially unsealed just Wednesday. What happens next could intensify, rather than quell, the racial tensions that have been simmering in the two months since the shooting. Wednesday's indictment coincided with the start of jury selection in the trial of the five officers in Brooklyn who were indicted in last year's torture and sodomy, inside a stationhouse bathroom, of Haitian immigrant Abner Louima. The Louima trial, too, is bound to be perceived _ and treated _ as a showcase of the dark underbelly of the N.Y.P.D. Potential jurors have been instructed to fill out a 42-page questionnaire, asking 128 questions, such as ``Do you think there is a prospect of social unrest following a verdict in this case?'' and ``Have you ever been exposed to persons who show, or who have shown, racial, sexual, religious, or ethnic prejudice?'' and ``How would you rate the job the New York City Police Department is doing in dealing with crime?'' The Diallo case has spawned three official investigations _ by the US Justice Department, federal prosecutors, and the New York state attorney general _ into a possible pattern of racial discrimination in the department's practices. Meanwhile, some police are shouting back. A few hundred off-duty officers rallied outside the Bronx courthouse Wednesday, as well, some shouting, ``No justice, no police'' _ a threatening play on Sharpton's chant, ``No justice, no peace.'' Inside the courtroom, though, the atmosphere was solemn. The four officers, wearing suits, sat stonefaced. Among the spectators, on one side of the aisle were Diallo's parents, who had flown in from Guinea for the occasion, along with friens and relatives. On the other side were friends of the officers. There were no outbursts. Diallo's mother, Kadiadou Diallo, had tears in her eyes. Later in the day, lawyer Johnnie Cochran, who is representing Diallo's parents, announced he will sue the city for civil damages, saying, ``We will be relentless in our pursuit of justice.'' The Diallo shooting has set off the largest protests the city has seen in years _ and cast a serious blemish on the pride of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's five years as mayor. Crime has dramatically declined, with murders down by over 70 percent, to the lowest point since the early 1960s. But many people are now wondering if the social cost _ white officers behaving too aggressively and intrusively in minority neighborhoods _ might be too high. In a 15 days leading up to Wednesday's indictment, 1,203 people _ including prominent officials, lawyers and other professionals of all races and religions _ were arrested in Sharpton-led civil-disobedience protests outside police department headquarters. Those protests are now over, but Sharpton promised Wednesday, ``We will keep on marching, we will keep the pressure on.'' Lawyers on both sides Wednesday offered previews of the cases they will argue when the trial starts April 30. Bronx District Attorney Robert Johnson noted New York law does not require him to prove premeditation on the part of the four officers. Rather, he need only show that they shot Diallo ``with intent to cause'' Diallo's death, acted with ``a depraved indifference to human life,'' and ``did recklessly engage in conduct which created a grave risk of death.'' The defense lawyers called their clients ``political prisoners,'' and said they would show the incident was ``a tragedy, not a crime,'' because the officers had ``reasonable'' cause to believe Diallo was reaching for a gun when they fired. One lawyer said his client, Richard Murphy, did not fire until he saw McMellon fall. McMellon had slipped on the sidewalk, but Murphy thought, his lawyer said, that he had been shot. "

			"text":" The arraignment and the subsequent comments by the officers' lawyers offered a glimpse of the defense they will provide. Stephen Brounstein, the lawyer for Boss, and James Culleton, the lawyer for Murphy, both said that their clients heard gunfire and saw McMellon on the ground, leading them to assume that McMellon had been shot. After the arraignment, Kornberg said his client, Carroll, had seen a ``black object'' _ which turned out to be Diallo's wallet _ coming out of the victim's back pocket. ``My client saw him reaching into his back pocket, saw this black object come out and my client yelled `Gun!''' Kornberg said. After the court proceedings, the officers briefly thanked their supporters, and proclaimed their innocence. Eyes welling, brows knitted, Murphy said, ``I did nothing wrong and this trial will show that I did nothing wrong.'' But the Diallos, who met with Johnson for half an hour before the arraignment, and their supporters expressed satisfaction with the indictments. ``Amadou's blood will feed the battle for justice for everyone in this life,'' said Diallo's mother, Kadiadou Diallo, at a news conference after the arraignment at the Manhattan law offices of Johnny Cochran, who said he would prepare a civil suit on behalf of the Diallo family. Police officers have rarely been convicted for killings that occurred while they were on duty. The last such case was in July 1997, when Officer Paolo Colecchia was convicted of second-degree manslaughter for fatally shooting an unarmed man in the back as he fled down a Bronx subway platform.

			"text":" NEW YORK (AP) -- The cheering began as the parents of Amadou Diallo left the prosecutor's office. Black bystanders fell in behind the couple Wednesday as they marched two blocks to a courthouse where four white police officers pleaded innocent to murder charges in the shooting death of the Diallos' son, a 22-year-old street vendor from Guinea with no criminal record. The officers heard cheers, too -- from scores of their off-duty colleagues, most of them white. ``On Feb. 4, in the vestibule in his own building, Amadou Diallo stood blameless, unarmed and defenseless when 19 of 41 shots were fired at him, struck him and killed him,'' prosecutor Robert Johnson told the court. ``These four defendants intended to take his life.'' The case has inspired a painful examination of police attitudes and tactics across the nation. Earlier this month, President Clinton said he was worried that recent charges of police misconduct could undermine the fight against crime. More than 1,200 people have been arrested in the city in demonstrations since Diallo was cut down in the fusillade. Many of the protesters -- white and black, celebrities and common folk -- also demonstrated against the alleged police torture of Haitian immigrant Abner Louima in 1997 and the feeling that law-abiding minorities are routinely humiliated by police stop-and-search tactics. ``Amadou's blood will feed the battle for justice,'' his mother, Kadiadou Diallo, told 1,000 supporters outside the courthouse. The Rev. Jesse Jackson, who was arrested at a Feb. 19 rally protesting the Diallo killing, praised prosecutors for taking what he called ``the first step in the pursuit of justice'' but added that ``justice will not prevail until the officers are punished for the crime.'' ``Even under duress,'' Jackson said, ``those who are called to uphold the law must be held at a higher standard.'' The killing has frayed Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's already tense relationship with New York's black community. Many have accused him of failing to understand the depth of New Yorkers' anger over the incident. Giuliani declined to comment on the charges, but said earlier in the day: ``We should allow the criminal justice system to now operate. ... Now you move to another stage in which the crime has to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.'' Officers Kenneth Boss, Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon and Richard Murphy -- who were searching for a rape suspect and fired apparently believing Diallo had a gun -- showed little emotion when the charges were read. Each was indicted on two counts of second-degree murder and one count of reckless endangerment. They could get 25 years to life in prison on the murder charges. Judge John Collins set bail at $100,000 for each officer, although Johnson had asked that they be held without bail. The officers were immediately suspended from the force. They had been on desk duty. Marvyn Kornberg, Carroll's lawyer, called the murder count ``ludicrous.'' ``What's the district attorney saying, that they had nothing to do that night but roll up on an individual and attempt to kill him because he's black?'' he asked. Lawyers for the four officers spoke separately in court, offering the first glimpse of the defense account of what went wrong the night they confronted Diallo outside his Bronx apartment building. James Culleton, Murphy's lawyer, said his client ``had a sick feeling inside of him, believing that he was going to be shot, and he reacted.'' Culleton and Steven Brounstein, Boss's attorney, said their clients fired because they saw an officer on the ground. McMellon reportedly slipped and fell as the officers confronted Diallo. Boss ``believed there was a fire fight was going on,'' Brounstein said. At a news conference, Johnson criticized the officers for choosing not to testify before the grand jury which voted last week to indict them. ``Having exercised that right, they cannot then say, `We're police officers, therefore what we did was OK,''' he said. ``Without explanation, what we have is four people driving up to a location, pulling out their guns and killing an individual.'' The Rev. Al Sharpton, who organized daily protests against the shooting, praised the grand jury's action. ``We can only say that it is appropriate that these policemen have been indicted for murder,'' he said. Diallo's father would only say, ``I'm very happy.'' Since the shooting, New York's street-crime unit has been ordered to wear uniforms instead of plainclothes, and 50 slots at the predominantly white division will be reassigned to minority police officers. Earlier Wednesday, Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Safir attended an emotional tribute to a cop killed in the line of duty in 1996. Safir called Diallo's death a tragedy but urged NYPD critics to ``acknowledge the tragedies that befall our family.'' ``We grieve for Amadou Diallo and the four officers involved and pray they get a fair trial,'' Safir said.

			"headline":"IN DIALLO CASE, ALL SIDES SEE PHYSICAL EVIDENCE AS CRUCIAL",
			"text":" NEW YORK _ With the indictments barely unsealed against four police officers in the Amadou Diallo shooting, a battle is already taking shape over physical evidence in the case, as lawyers and experts seek to buttress their own versions of what happened based on entrance wounds, bullet trajectories and other forensic details. Since there were apparently no eyewitnesses who saw the whole incident except for the officers, such evidence _ and the often fuzzy or conflicting interpretations it can yield _ could be a crucial element in the officers' trial on murder charges. Both sides hope to use forensic evidence to answer vexing questions that have loomed since Feb. 4, when Diallo was killed in fusillade of 41 bullets fired into the vestibule of his Bronx apartment building. Where was he when the four plainclothes officers began shooting? How quickly did he fall? Is there anything at the crime scene to explain why the officers unleashed such firepower at an unarmed man? The potential significance of the forensic evidence is apparent in the efforts being expended by all sides to collect it: _ The Police Department's Internal Affairs Bureau has done an extensive re-enactment of the shooting at the department's firing range. _ The FBI dispatched a team of ballistic experts from Washington who spent days making measurements of the crime scene and traced bullet trajectories with lasers. _ Defense lawyers have employed their own set of crime-scene specialists who may be called to rebut whatever theories the prosecution's experts propose. _ The Diallo family has employed a pathologist whose autopsy has led to charges by their lawyers that the West African immigrant was shot repeatedly, even after he had collapsed, paralyzed, from his initial wounds. ``The forensic evidence is critical to the case because it is the forensic evidence that offers the best challenge to the credibility of the four police officers,'' said Peter Neufeld, a lawyer for the Diallo family, which is planning to bring a civil suit in the case. ``You can question their story based on common sense and logic and what passersby might have seen or heard. But none of that can be as devastating an impeachment as objective, irrefutable scientific evidence.'' Not surprisingly, the officers' lawyers embrace the same irrefutable science to argue a opposite position. ``I am not afraid of the forensic evidence,'' said Stephen Worth, the attorney for Officer Edward McMellon, one of the four accused of second-degree murder. ``What the forensic evidence will not show is that these officers fired repeatedly into a prone body. Quite the contrary, I expect it to show the opposite, that, namely, the vast majority of the shots, if not all of the shots, were fired at a standing person.'' Of course, it is far from certain that a verdict in the case will hinge on forensic evidence. Assuming the officers testify, their credibility in asserting that they feared for their lives in the mistaken belief that Diallo was armed could also be a decisive factor. But it seems likely that a dizzying parade of expert witnesses will take the stand at the trial to debate the trigonometric calculation of bullet trajectories, and more importantly, to contradict one another. ``Ideally, the physical evidence should support one conclusion,'' said Peter R. De Forest, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. ``But what often happens is that one side or the other pays someone to dispute it and the science gets polluted.'' The Bronx district attorney's office has declined to comment on details of the evidence or how it might be used in the trial. But the Diallo family lawyers have shown no such reticence, virtually constructing a criminal case against the officers while preparing the civil suit. One of the central disputes will likely focus on the officers' assertion that Diallo continued to stand upright, even after he had been hit by many of the 19 bullets that struck him. There are apparently no eyewitnesses to confirm or rebut that account, although several of Diallo's neighbors on Wheeler Avenue have said they saw a portion of the incident and heard the shooting. But the Diallo family's lawyers dismissed the officers' version as ``absurd,'' pointing to an autopsy by their pathologist, Dr. Cyril H. Wecht of Pennsylvania, that suggests that Diallo was knocked down and paralyzed quite early in the barrage. ``Amadou Diallo was already on the ground with his spinal cord severed,'' said the Rev. Al Sharpton, a family adviser, ``so the alibi they have put on the court record will devastate the defense.'' The official autopsy by the city Medical Examiner's office does not discuss the sequence of shots, the position of Diallo's body when he was hit or whether he was paralyzed at any point, people who have reviewed the report have said. The autopsy report does indicate that two shots, one from the front and one from the back, perforated Diallo's spine at separate points. Those perforations are the primary basis for the family's conclusion that he was paralyzed. Wecht's analysis that those shots came early in the sequence is based, in part, on the amount of blood from those wounds that filled his chest cavity. But Marvyn Kornberg, who represents Officer Sean Carroll, said the officers' semiautomatic weapons fired so fast that it is impossible to determine with any precision when the shots to the chest were fired. ``You are talking about a matter of eight seconds,'' he said. ``You can't tell which is first and which is second. Any medical examiner who testifies to that can expect some rigorous cross examination.'' A second set of bullets that struck Diallo's right leg and foot also figure to be a source of debate. The city's autopsy indicates that one shot struck Diallo just above the heel and traveled up the calf before lodging behind the knee, people who reviewed the report have said. The Diallo family's lawyers believe this bullet, as well as a second bullet that the autopsy says hit Diallo's middle toe ``adjacent to the front of the nail,'' indicate that Diallo was shot after he had fallen. Defense lawyers dispute that conclusion and argue that the incident took so little time that the officers most likely had no chance to gauge the impact of their initial shots as they fired subsequent rounds. There could also be a dispute over just how much time elapsed as the 41 shots were fired, especially since witnesses have said they heard a pause in the firing, apparently caused when Officer Edward McMellon fell down while firing.

			"headline":"SETTING A SCHEDULE IS THE NEXT LEGAL STEP",
			"text":" NEW YORK _ Now that the four police officers charged with killing Amadou Diallo have been arraigned, the next step in the legal process will come at the end of the month, when their lawyers and Bronx prosecutors are to appear before a judge to set a schedule for the pretrial proceedings. That meeting is set for April 30 at the state Supreme Court in the Bronx, before Acting Justice Patricia Anne Williams. Defense lawyers will be given a timetable in which to make their motions, or requests to the court. Prosecutors will be given deadlines to respond to those motions. If the matters are likely to be contested, the judge might set dates for hearings. Marvyn M. Kornberg, the lawyer representing Officer Sean Carroll, said Thursday that in addition to standard motions like those for discovery _ in which lawyers ask prosecutors to hand over the information they have collected _ he expected defense lawyers to ask the judge to review the grand jury minutes to decide if the indictments were supported by the evidence. A request for a change of venue is also possible, he said. Kornberg also said he plans to ask the court to review grand jury attendance records to make sure that a quorum were present each day, and that the grand jurors who voted to indict the officers were present to hear all the evidence presented. ``If they weren't present, or there wasn't a quorum, these indictments may be dismissed on motions,'' Kornberg said. After the initial motions, other issues may arise, including whether any of the defendants ask for separate trials and whether the officers waive their right to a jury trial. Police officers in criminal trials have often asked for a judge to decide their case, fearing that juries would be unsympathetic. "

			"headline":"FOUR OFFICERS IN DIALLO CASE RETURN TO WORK; TRIAL SET FOR JAN. 3",
			"text":" NEW YORK _ The four New York City police officers charged with murdering Amadou Diallo returned to work with pay Friday after attending a morning court session in the Bronx in which a Jan. 3 trial date was set. They left the courtroom to the cheers of nearly 200 other officers, gathered outside the Bronx County Building. But inside state Supreme Court, the defense team showed signs of division. Marvyn M. Kornberg, the lawyer for Sean Carroll, said he might make a motion to disqualify Stephen C. Worth, the lawyer for Edward McMellon. Kornberg said Worth, who had represented all of the officers immediately after the shooting, might have a conflict of interest now since he was representing only one of them and might be forced to cross-examine the others. It was a point that Worth disputed outside court by saying, ``I don't think I have a conflict of interest, though it is obvious that Kornberg would like for me to go.'' Police officials declined to say where the officers _ Kenneth Boss, Richard Murphy, Carroll and McMellon _ would be working, adding only that they were on modified duty and carrying no guns or badges. Worth said that the officers reported to their new assignments Friday but would not officially start work until Monday, on what police officials called administrative assignments. Friday, acting Justice Patricia Anne Williams, who refused defense requests to put off scheduling a date for the case, chose the Jan. 3 date after the defense lawyers said they would need time to go through the prosecution's evidence and discuss possible pretrial motions. The lawyers also said there could be pretrial scheduling conflicts because of other trials some of them are involved in, like the Abner Louima case, in which officers are accused of brutalizing a Haitian immigrant. That case is set to begin on Tuesday. Prosecutors turned over more than 160 pages of forensic, ballistic and crime scene evidence to the defense lawyers, adding that more would be forthcoming. The judge said the next court appearance would be on Sept. 29, when she would decide all motions. While the trial date would come nearly a year after Diallo's death on the night of Feb. 4, it is not unusual in such high-publicity cases. Defense lawyers are usually pleased by delays to the extent that they can temper bad publicity about the case, which they see as possibly prejudicial to their clients. But if the delay was welcome, there were still Kornberg's efforts to force Worth, the official lawyer for the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, off the case. Kornberg said later that if Worth was not disqualified, Kornberg might push for a separate trial for Carroll. The issue of severing the cases is important because the defendants will probably need one another's testimony to corroborate their accounts of the shooting. For example, the defense has suggested that the 41 shots fired at Diallo _ a number that has become a flash point in the case _ were precipitated by one of the officers yelling ``Gun!'' and another falling down some steps as if he had been shot.
