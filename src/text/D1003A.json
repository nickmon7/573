The three Beijing giant pandas about to leave were born respectively in 1991, 1999 and 2003, and one of the three Sichuan pandas was also born last year. Wolong is a famous giant panda habitat where the world-known China Conservation and Research Center of the Giant Panda is located. "

			"text":" China will soon finish building its first blood bank for pandas, which will assist researchers in studying the endangered animals' blood types and chances of accepting blood transfusions, state media said Friday. The bank at southwest China's Giant Panda Protection and Research Centre in the Wolong Nature Reserve in Sichuan province will be completed this year, the China Daily said. Located in the giant panda breeding lab, the bank will help researchers answer questions such as how many blood types pandas have and whether they reject blood transfusions, centre sources said. Initial studies have found that pandas have different blood types, but researchers have not conducted in-depth studies and lack sufficient knowledge about this, centre deputy chief engineer Huang Yan said. The centre will hold a general survey of the blood types of all the 81 pandas being kept there, and collect and store their blood to better prepare for the protection and rescue of pandas in the wild. To boost their blood, researchers currently give pandas injections of glucose and medicine, but blood transfusions are more effective in helping the animals improve their immunity and accelerate the process of recovery. A blood bank can also simplify the process of breeding pandas because data on the pandas' blood types and DNA information will be readily available to bring more diversity to the gene pool. China has 163 giant pandas in captivity. There are only about 1,590 of the endangered species living in the wild, all in China, though the numbers have risen steadily in the past decade after plunging to around 1,100 in the 1980s. "

			"text":" About 100 giant pandas in northwest China's Gansu Province are suffering from hunger because large tracts of arrow bamboo have bloomed and died. By the end of 2004, arrow bamboo, the favorite food of giants, had blossomed on 7,420 hectares at the Baishuijiang State Nature Reserve in southern Gansu Province, a major habitat of pandas in China, according to a recent survey conducted by the nature reserve administration. The giant panda is one of the world's most endangered species, with an estimated 1,000 living in the mountainous regions of Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu provinces. To protect the animal, dubbed China's \"national treasure,\" the country has set up 33 nature reserves, covering a total area of 1.6 million hectares. The Baishuijiang State Nature Reserve is home to more than 100 giant pandas. Currently, they are threatened by a severe food shortage in the wake of the withering bamboo. What is worse, arrow bamboo on another 1,950 hectares which blossomed in 1993 has not grown tall enough for consumption. Since it usually takes 15 years for the new plants to grow adequately to supply enough food for groups of pandas, food remains scarce for the pandas. To help pandas tide over the difficult period, many townships in Gansu Province have set up rescue teams to care for the rare animals. "

			"text":" Forest coverage in southwestern Sichuan Province has increased to 27.94 percent from 24.3 percent in 2003, making the region, a major habitat of giant pandas, a greener home, according to the local government. More than 20 million hectares of forest have been brought under protection and 3.61 million hectares of forest have been planted since 1997. This is a result of two provincial projects, the natural forest protection and cultivated land reforestation, said Yang Dongsheng, head of the provincial forestry department. \"We have given priority to the afforestation in the habitats, especially nature reserves, for giant pandas,\" said Yang. The province's efforts have paid off. The latest national survey on giant panda, which was organized by the State Forestry Administration, showed that the population and habitat of the pandas in Sichuan have both increased 30 percent during the past seven years. \"Now China has about 1,700 giant pandas and 76 percent of them live in Sichuan,\" said Yang, adding that the provincial government has obtained a financial support of more than 24 million yuan (2. 89 million US dollars) for nature reserve construction from the central government. \"We will definitely first consider the panda natural reserves when planning how to use the money,\" said the official.

			"text":" The discovery of panda traces in Fengxian County, northwest China's Shaanxi Province, demonstrates that the habitat of the rare creatures is expanding in this inland province, an official with the Shaanxi Provincial Forestry Bureau said. On Dec. 14 last year, Feng Shiliang, a farmer from Youfangzui Village, told the Fengxian County Wildlife Management Station that he had spotted an animal that looked very much like a giant panda and had seen giant panda dung while collecting bamboo leaves on a local mountain. Experts with the Shaanxi Provincial Wildlife Management Station confirmed that the dung was left by an adult giant panda. They ascribed the appearance of giant pandas in Fengxian County, located on the western section of Qinling Mountain, a major habitat for giant pandas, to the local government's strenuous efforts to restore and protect natural forest resources in the region over recent years. Giant pandas used to live in Fengxian County before the 1970s but later disappeared from the area owing to the construction of the railway from Baoqi in Shaanxi to the capital city of Chengdu in southwestern Sichuan province. A project to protect the natural forest was kicked off in the area in 1999. The Shaanxi provincial government approved the establishment of the Wuliang Mountain Nature Reserve in 2002. Wang Wanyun, head of the bureau's Wildlife Protection section, said that traces of giant pandas have also been left and spotted in neighboring Zhouzhi and Liuba counties over the past two years. The third national survey on giant pandas, which began in 2000 and ended last year, shows that pandas live in mountain areas of 20 towns of eight counties along the east-west Qinling Mountain in Shaanxi Province. A total of 273 wild giant pandas have been spotted in an area of 347,864 hectares, which officials say means there are 7.8 pandas on per 100 sq km, the highest density among all pandas' habitats in China. Wang said, Shaanxi has so far established 13 giant pandas protection zones and nature reserves focused on pandas' habitats. Giant pandas are said to have been around during the time of dinosaurs and regarded as a \"national gem\" of China. About 1,590 giant pandas are still at large in the wild, mostly in the high mountains around Sichuan Basin, and 160 live in captivity. The central and provincial governments have invested 160 million yuan (nearly 20 million US dollars) into panda protection programs since 1992. China built its first natural preserve for giant pandas and began to ban poaching in the 1950s. The pandas have been put under state protection in the past four decades since 1962. "

			"headline":"China's endangered panda expands habitat ATTENTION - ADDS information on sub-species of giant panda ///",
			"text":" China's endangered panda is migrating into forest areas restored by the government, the re-discovery of its dung in northern Shaanxi province indicates, state press reported Wednesday. Scatologists identified the panda droppings in the region's Qinling mountains where it lived 30 years ago, while locals have reported sighting animals resembling the bear, Xinhua news agency reported. The reappearance of the panda in the western parts of the Qinling mountains was attributed to recent efforts by the government to restore the region's natural habitat, the report said. The Qinling panda has been identified as a sub-species of the giant panda that mainly resides in southwestern Sichuan province. Only around 1,600 pandas are believed to live in the wild, with some 300 of the sub-species living in the Qinling mountains, while the other 1,300 giant pandas live elsewhere in China, Xinhua said in a separate report. \"In terms of bio-diversity protection, Qinling and Sichuan pandas need equal protection, but it is a more urgent task to rescue and protect Qinling pandas due to their smaller number,\" Wang Wanyun, chief of the Wild Animals Protection section of the Shaanxi Provincial Forestry Bureau, told Xinhua. Giant pandas, said to have been around during the time of dinosaurs, are cited as a \"national gem\" of China. The Qinling pandas are believed to have separated from the giant panda about 50,000 years ago, Chinese researchers said. Last week Xinhua reported that some 7,420 hectares of bamboo, the panda's favourite food, bloomed and died in December in neighboring Gansu province, 200 kilometers (120 miles) west of the Qinling mountains. This has meant there is little for pandas to eat in Gansu's Baishuijiang nature park. "

			"text":" Days of heavy snowfall and an ensuing drop in temperatures forced an adult giant panda to hobble downhill for help at weekend in southwestern Sichuan Province, the Beijing Morning Post reported. The panda was critically ill and had fallen into a coma when she was spotted Sunday morning by a passing driver beside a road six km from the famous Wolong giant panda research and conservation center, the paper said on Tuesday. The giant panda came to after over five hours' infusion and oxygen therapy at the center, though she did not stop shivering until the room was heated with two electric heaters. \"She was fragile and afraid of severe cold,\" Li Desheng, an expert with the center, was quoted as saying. The 62.5-km giant panda suffers a couple of ailments, including pneumonia and respiratory problems, and had a temperature below the normal range, Li said. Winter is often a hard time for old or weak wildlife. This panda's situation was compounded by food shortage, as the fallen snow has covered up bamboo groves, the ideal dish for the giant pandas. \"She isn't out of danger,\" Li said. \"The forestry department will decide whether to send her back to the wild depending on her physical condition.\" The giant panda is one of the world's most rare and endangered species, with an estimated some 1,000 living in the mountainous regions of Sichuan in southwest China, and northwestern Shaanxi and Gansu provinces. To protect the animal species, dubbed a \"national gem,\" China has set up 33 nature reserves with a combined area of 1.6 million hectares. "

Zhang Kerong, director of the Baishuijiang State Nature Preserve, said that the preserve will intervene and help giant pandas find new food source. Zhang said that at the end of a life of arrow bamboo, a favorite of giant pandas, the plant will flower, seed and die. The giant pandas will not eat the bamboo after it blooms and it takes 10 years for a new supply to grow. The bamboo blooming in the early 1980s caused the deaths of about 250 giant pandas. Zhang said that 22 giant pandas living in the Bikou and Rangshuihe areas, where much of the bamboo is blooming, are currently under the threat of starvation. Workers in the preserve will move old and weak giant pandas and lure fit pandas to a new habitats, Zhang said. As of late last year, the flowering bamboo covered more than 7, 000 hectares of the nature preserve. And the blooming area has continued to expand. The nature preserve, occupying about 220,000 hectares, has 102 giant pandas living wild. Currently, more than 1,500 giant pandas live in the wild in the country, according to a survey by the State Forestry Administration. In Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces, two other habitats of giant pandas, arrow bamboo was also found blooming. The Baishuijiang preserve and local governments have enhanced education about giant panda protection and asked locals not to harm the animals if hungry giant pandas enter villages to look for food. Zhang said that the preserve will dispatch frequent patrols and rescue giant pandas in danger of starvation. "

			"text":" Flowering arrow bamboo is threatening a colony of endangered giant pandas in China but experts have come up with a plan to save them, state media said Monday. Twenty-two giant pandas living in parts of Baishuijiang State Nature Reserve in the northwestern province of Gansu will be moved to other locations with better food, the China Daily said, quoting Zhang Kerong, director of the reserve. Arrow bamboo in two areas of the reserve which they inhabit is flowering, which means the plant will seed and die at the end of its life span. Giant pandas will not eat the bamboo after it blooms and it takes 10 years for a new supply to grow. Bamboo blooming in the early 1980s caused the deaths of about 250 giant pandas, the report said. Zhang said the reserve will send frequent patrols and rescue giant pandas in danger of starvation, but did not say where they would go or how they would be moved. Locals, meanwhile, have been told not to harm the animals if they enter villages looking for food. As of late last year, the flowering bamboo covered more than 7,000 hectares (17,290 acres) of the 220,000-hectare nature reserve and the blooming area has continued to expand. More than 100 giant pandas live there. To help them survive, the Baishuijiang reserve is planting more bamboo in hopes of helping the animals to increase their population. However, a survey found that 12 percent of planted bamboo showed signs of blooming, rendering it inedible, China Daily said. If the situation worsens all the pandas in the reserve will have to be transferred elsewhere. Since the 1970s, many pandas in the reserve have died because of food shortages. Currently more than 1,500 giant pandas live wild in China, according to a survey by the State Forestry Administration. The government has set up more than 50 reserves, most in the southwest province of Sichuan. But in Sichuan and in Shaanxi province, which also has panda reserves, arrow bamboo has also been found blooming. Giant pandas also continue to face threats from humans such as poaching, mining and logging, the report said. "
