			"text":" CANBERRA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The Papua New Guinea (PNG) Defense Force, the police and health services are on standby to help the victims of a tsunami that wiped out several villages, killing scores of people, on PNG's remote north-west coast Friday night. \"Prime Minister Bill Skate has directed that immediate action be taken to arrange urgent supplies of food, water, shelter and cooking utensils while detailed assessments and reports are being prepared,\" Robert Igara, chief secretary of the PNG government, said Saturday in a statement, Australian Associated Press reported. Igara said the PNG Red Cross had confirmed arrangements to provide food supplies and authorities had asked the Australian High Commission in Port Moresby for immediate air transport support. The death toll so far from the tsunami that struck the coastline near the town of Aitape in the West Sepik (Sandaun) province Friday night, was officially announced 64 and many more people were missing. Igara said reports so far indicated that a community school, government station, Catholic mission station and the Nimas village in the Sissano area west of Aitape had been completely destroyed, where 30 people were dead. And Warapu village had also been completely destroyed, with 11 confirmed deaths and many missing. Sixteen people in the devastated Arop village were confirmed dead, and two children had died in the Malalo village, which was wiped out. Another five people died in the Teles-Lambu villages. Igara said the population in the area affected by the tsunami was 8,000 to 10,000 people. \"Officers are now visiting the affected villages and areas to establish the whereabouts, safety and health of the population,\" he said. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Bill Skate, National Disaster Services Chairman Colin Travertz and National Disaster Services Director-General Ludwig Kembu were reported to inspect the affected areas Sunday.

			"text":" CANBERRA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Australia will provide transport for relief supplies and a mobile hospital to Papua New Guinea (PNG) following Friday's tsunami tragedy. Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer said a Royal Australian Air Force C130 Hercules aircraft currently in PNG on training exercises would be diverted to deliver relief supplies such as tarpaulins and food to the affected areas in the country's remote north. \"We will also transport a mobile hospital and associated Australian Defense Force (ADF) medical personnel to the disaster area to provide urgent medical assistance to injured victims,\" Downer said Saturday in a statement. The massive tidal wave wiped seven villages off the map, leaving hundreds people dead or missing. The 10-metre tsunami engulfed the heavily populated villages near Aitape, 800 kilometers north of Port Moresby on Friday night - 30 minutes after an undersea earthquake of about 7.0 on the Richter scale in the area. Many of the villagers are believed to have died instantly as the deadly wall of water struck without warning, sending their homes crashing into the raging torrent. Downer said the federal government stood ready to consider further requests for assistance from the PNG government. "

			"text":" PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ Huge sea waves set off by an earthquake crashed against Papua New Guinea's north coast, killing at least 70 people and crushing villages, the country's National Disaster Center said. The 23-foot (seven-meter) wall of water, called tsunami, hit Friday night without warning just after an earthquake about 12 miles (30 kilometers) off the coast. The Australian Geological Survey Organization said it had a preliminary magnitude of 7.0. The disaster center said late Saturday that hundreds are missing and thousands are without food and shelter. ``We expect that about 3,000 people have been made homeless and there has been an estimate of about 300 people dead or missing,'' Fr. Austin Crapp, a relief organizer, told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio. He said most of the dead were children who drowned. Disaster authorities said the seismic sea wave struck to the west of the town of Aitape in the West Sepik province, hitting at least four villages _ Sissano, Warapu, Arop and Malol. The area is spotted with villages consisting of homes built on beaches of jungle materials. ``At Warapu, there is no house standing _ it's a village of 1,800 people,'' Crapp said. ``Arop, again, is 1,800 to 2,000 people _ there's nothing standing there. ``They (the two villages) are both clean sand. It's complete devastation.'' A helicopter pilot who landed in Aitape on Saturday reported seeing bodies floating among the debris in the lagoon, he said. Papua New Guinea provincial disaster coordinator Peter Tavun said homeless survivors were in desperate need of food and shelter. Crapp said a helicopter was picking up injured people and doctors had been flown in to treat them. The injured, mostly suffering cuts and fractures, were being taken to a mission hospital at Aitape. Rob Parer, a businessman who lives near Aitape, said some villagers who fled into the jungle after the tsunami struck are still hiding there. ``The people have never heard of anything like it. They thought the world had ended,'' Parer told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio. In Canberra, Australian seismologist Kevin McCue from the Australian Geological Survey Organization said the earthquake's epicenter was just off the town of Aitape. ``It was a shallow, major earthquake,'' he said. An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.0 is devastating if it hits an urban area. The last tsunami in the area had been in December 1930 when a magnitude 6.5 earthquake struck the Admiralty Islands, McCue said. Meanwhile, Australia said Saturday it will provide transport for relief supplies and a mobile hospital to Papua New Guinea. Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer said a Royal Australian Air Force C-130 Hercules aircraft now in Papua New Guinea on training exercises would be diverted to deliver relief supplies. ``We will also transport a mobile hospital and associated Australian Defense Force medical personnel to the disaster area to provide urgent medical assistance to injured victims,'' Downer said in a statement.

The National Disaster Center said Sunday that hundreds of people are missing and thousands have no food or shelter. The Papua New Guinea Defense Force was on standby Sunday and police and health services officials expected the official death toll of 71 to rise. ``We expect that about 3,000 people have been made homeless and there has been an estimate of about 300 people dead or missing,'' Fr. Austen Crapp, a relief organizer, told Australian Broadcasting Corp. (ABC) radio. ABC radio, a government-owned corporation, quoted Australian army officials Sunday as saying the death toll could rise to as high as 2,000 people, but that figure could not be confirmed by Australia's government. Papua New Guinea, with a population of 4 million, is largely dependent on agriculture and mining.

			"headline":"3 Australian Planes Sent to PNG's Tidal Wave-Hit Area",
			"text":" CANBERRA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Australia Sunday sent three Air Force C130 Hercules aircraft loaded with medical and food supplies on an urgent mission to help survivors of a devastating tsunami which struck Papua New Guinea (PNG) Friday night. The tidal wave smashed into the northwestern coastline near the town of Aitape in West Sepik province, killing at least 600 people, according to reports reaching here. Australian Defense Minister Ian McLachlan told reporters in Adelaide that Australia's aid agency, AusAid, estimated the final toll would be well over 1,000, with many thousands injured and as many as 6,000 left homeless. Two Hercules aircraft left the Richmond airforce base, north-west of Sydney, in the afternoon, while another plane took off from Townsville. The planes were due to arrive Sunday night and fly out to the devastated region Monday morning. McLachlan said the aircraft were ferrying 60 medical personnel with the aim of setting up a mobile hospital in the area. However, he said that how quickly the medical crew could get to work would depend on whether the landing strip at Wanimo was long enough for the C130s to land and the possibility of further earthquakes. \"It's very rough terrain and our problem is finding an area we can land and get in our equipment,\" he was quoted by the Australian Associated Press as saying. Defense ministry spokesman Colonel Keith Jobson said that even when the planes touched down at the airstrip, the defense personnel would still have to use helicopters or road transport to access the stricken villages. Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer described the events in PNG as \"horrific\", saying Australia would do all it could to help PNG cope with the crisis. \"We'll be further liaising with the Papua New Guinea government to provide realistic help in those circumstances,\" he said.

Associated Press photographer Brian Cassey flew over the lagoon Sunday and said the beaches on which a number of villages had been built had been swept clean. ``The villages no longer exist. The beaches are clean,'' Cassey said. ``The lagoon is filled with debris, coconut palms and what used to be houses.'' In Arop, where according to locals about 2,000 people lived, there was no sign of life, he said. No bodies were visible from the air. ``The place is desolate. Not a soul is there,'' Cassey said. Dalle said that at Warapu 500 people had been confirmed dead, while Malol village had 40 dead and Sissano 41.

Three Australian Defense Forces Hercules C-130 transport planes were due to takeoff from Australia late Sunday with equipment to set up a filed hospital in the stricken region. A fourth was diverted from training exercises in Papua New Guinea and has begun making food drops, McLachlan said. The condition of airstrips in the region was unknown and it was not known if the planes would be able to land. Small aircraft and helicopters are already ferrying some of the injured to unaffected towns.
