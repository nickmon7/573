			"text":" HONG KONG, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong health authorities are stepping up the hunt for the source of a deadly influenza strain previously found only in birds which has caused a global alert. The \"bird flu\" has claimed four victims here, killing two, including a 54-year-old man who died Friday. At least seven staff who had contact with the victims were experiencing flu-like symptoms, but it was not clear if they had also contracted the H5N1 strain, local health officials said today. Investigators fanned out across the territory Monday, checking poultry farms for traces of the disease amid the speculation that it could have been passed to humans by chickens. All hospitals and clinics in Hong Kong have been ordered to test patients for the flu. A number of the patients' relatives were also found developing flu-like symptoms and were undergoing tests. A three-year-old boy and a man died earlier this year after catching the \"bird flu\", or H5N1 strain of influenza, and a 13-year-old girl is in hospital with the disease. Another victim, a two-year-old boy, who was hospitalized with fever in November, later fully recovered. World Health Organization (WHO) officials in Geneva said leading researchers would this week decide whether a vaccine should be developed, according to reports reaching here. "

			"text":" MACAO, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Macao experts today warned residents to be careful but not panic over the bird flu that has killed children in neighboring Hong Kong. No bird flu case has been found in Macao and people should stay calm, experts from the Macao Nurses' Association and the Public Health Department said. But they did urge people to be careful in contacting birds, take care of proper personal and environmental hygiene and cook their food thoroughly. Leung Iok Va, deputy-secretary-general of the Macao Nurses' Association, told the Macao Daily News today that there is no effective way of prevention as the cause and way of transmission of the bird flu on human beings have not been found. Meanwhile, local dealers of imported fowls said imported chickens, ducks and geese are safe to eat because they have passed strict examinations before they are put on the local market. The poultry imported from China's inland areas are from a different source from those imported by Hong Kong, they said. While Hong Kong's imports mostly come from Shenzhen, Macao's are mainly from Zhuhai, Zhongshan and Jiangmen cities. The experts want local residents to buy poultry only at licensed food stalls, saying those sold by illegal mobile vendors might be unsafe. "

			"headline":"HK Sets Up Working Group to Deal with Bird Flu",
			"text":" HONG KONG, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) set up an inter-department working group today to coordinate efforts towards the prevention and control of the spread of a mysterious \"bird flu\" that has killed two people. A SAR government spokesman said the group, which comprises representatives from various government departments, will hold its first meeting Tuesday. The group will coordinate measures necessary for the prevention and control of the \"bird flu,\" or H5N1 virus, the spokesman said. Chickens have been identified as the most likely source of a new strain of the flu. The move came after three more people were suspected last week to have been stricken with the H5NI virus, bringing the number of confirmed or suspected cases to seven. A 5-year-old child died in May in the first known case of a human contracting the virus. A 54-year-old man died early this month, and a 2-year-old boy recovered after hospitalization in November. Three more people remained hospitalized. The government also announced today that authorities in the neighboring Guangdong Province have agreed to step up the monitoring of chicken diseases at farms there. A statement said Guangdong also plans to restrict chicken exports to Hong Kong. Experts say they are baffled by the virus, and the hospital authority has issued guidelines to the public and hospitals to treat the potentially deadly flu. There has been no evidence of human-to-human transmission of the virus, and no infected chickens have been found at the market, according to a source from the local health department. Three more experts from the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta in the United States arrived in Hong Kong Thursday to help in the investigation, the source said. The World Health Organization has reportedly been asked to alert vaccine production centers worldwide to follow developments with a view to preparing the necessary vaccine. "

			"text":" HONG KONG, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The bird flu in Hong Kong, which has killed two people, has not become an epidemic, a local senior health official said today. Speaking at a news conference here, Director of the Health Department of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Margaret Chan said that the SAR government would take \"a number of preventive measures to protect public health.\" \"The present cluster of cases detected in Hong Kong has not reached epidemic proportions,\" she said. \"The efficiency of transmission from human to human should not be high or there should be hundreds and thousands of such cases in the SAR by now, according to past experience with other types of influenza,\" she added. However, \"the transmission of the virus both from bird to human and human to human is possible,\" Chan said. She stated that the SAR health authority has been working very closely with the World Health Organization and the Centers for Diseases Control in the United States in dealing with the investigation and study of this new strain of influenza A H5N1 virus. For the public, she advised that the best way to combat influenza infection is to build up body resistance by having a proper diet with adequate exercise and rest. \"Good ventilation should be maintained,\" she said, urging the public to maintain good personal hygiene. Chan told reporters that initial assessment made by a Special Working Group on Influenza A H5N1 noted an association with poultry in some of the cases under investigation. The inter-department Special Working Group was set up yesterday to coordinate efforts toward the prevention and control of the spread of the mysterious bird flu after three more people were suspected last week of having been infected with the H5NI virus, bringing the number of confirmed or suspected cases to seven. A 5-year-old child died in May in the first known case of a human contracting the virus. A 54-year-old succumbed to the virus early this month, but a 2-year-old boy recovered after hospitalization in November. Three more people remain hospitalized for the illness. Moreover, two more cases were classified as \"suspected\" by the Department of Health, increasing to nine the total number of H5N1 cases in human, Chan said. "

			"text":" MACAO, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The Public Health Department of Macao has called on residents to avoid contacting birds, and take proper protective measures if they have to. In a notice issued through the Macao Daily News Thursday, the health department said that residents should avoid contacting birds in case they might be infected with the deadly virus of bird flu known as H5N1. Although several cases were reported in Hong Kong, none was found in Macao so far. It is still unclear in which way human being catches the virus. The department said that people who have to contact birds should wear disposable gloves and protective suits, and wash their hands thoroughly after finishing their work. In addition, it reminded people to avoid staying with birds for a long time in a closed space where ventilation is poor. People should also see doctors immediately for proper treatment if they have fever or respiratory diseases. They should tell doctors of their contacts with birds. But it said the risk of infection is low because the H5N1 virus was only found in imported chicken so far. "

			"text":" SHENZHEN, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's neighbor city of Shenzhen has not discovered any case of H5N1 virus infection at its 200 poultry farms, according to a local official in charge of animal epidemics. \"There is no report of H5N1 cases among chickens so far, so eating chickens is safe,\" Zhao Changwang, director of the Shenzhen Institute of Veterinary Epidemic Prevention, told Shenzhen citizens today. Moreover, the H5N1 virus has not been found in 15,000 chicken blood samples that were taken randomly throughout Guangdong Province, Zhao said. The virus, known to cause \"bird influenza\" among chickens, apparently has been transferred to humans in Hong Kong. The virus is believed to be transmitted through contact with birds or their feces. Because strict preventive measures have been taken for a long period, Zhao said, there has been no bird flu epidemic in recent years among Shenzhen's 168 chicken runs and 38 pigeon farms. Zhao said that procedures for breeding and transporting poultry are always under intensive monitoring to avoid an epidemic. A top Chinese official in charge of animal quarantines confirmed on Thursday that the H5N1 virus has not been found among chickens shipped to Hong Kong and Macao. Yu Dahai, director of the Administration of Animal and Plant Quarantine under the Ministry of Agriculture, said he was satisfied with the disease control measures adopted by poultry farms and ports in Shenzhen. Inspections are under way to prevent a bird flu outbreak, such as random screening of chickens and checks on all poultry farms, said Yu, who is on a fact-finding tour in Shenzhen. "
