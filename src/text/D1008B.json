            "text": "\n<P>\nOn a crystal clear afternoon, the light air hinting of fall, the Miss\nBrandy motored up to a dock on the Kent Narrows in Grasonville, Md.,\nin front of W.H. Harris Seafood. Heaped like a pile of rocks in the\nmiddle of the boat was the morning's haul -- oysters, the rough and\ncraggy bottom dwellers that have been the shining jewels of the\nChesapeake Bay for generations.\n</P>\n<P>\nFrom the dock, Jason Ruth, a worker at Harris', began culling the\npile with an expert's eye, selecting those to keep and shuck and\nthose to return to the bay. Taking handfuls at a time, Ruth flung the\noysters back into the water. \"See,\" he said, picking up one in a\nfluid motion and knocking it with a quick tap against the pile,\nmaking a hollow thunk. \"There's nothing there. It's dead. Gone.\" The\nshell landed back in the water with a splash.\n</P>\n<P>\nSimilar scenes are unfolding these days up and down the Chesapeake\nBay, where the annual oyster season is becoming an endangered\ntradition. For centuries, the Chesapeake has been synonymous with\noysters. For early settlers, oyster reefs were so abundant that they\nposed a hazard for navigation, and with the introduction of canning\nin the 1800s, the Chesapeake became the source for oysters around the\nworld.\n</P>\n<P>\nBut the annual good cheer surrounding the season is waning. That is\nbecause Chesapeake watermen pulled an all-time low of about 25,000\nbushels of oysters from the bay last year, compared with 80,000 in\n1993 -- and a staggering 15 million back in the glory days of 1885.\nFrom 1920 to 1970, before the oyster began its rapid decline, the\nindustry contributed $65 million annually to the state of Maryland, a\nfigure that didn't include the tourism it attracted. The annual\nfigure has fallen to $500,000. Overharvesting and pollution have\ntaken a toll on the native oyster, but far bigger threats to the\nspecies are two parasites that attack them, Dermo and MSX, which were\nfirst detected in the bay in the 1960s.\n</P>\n<P>\nHarris' is a holdout in a devastated industry; one of the last\noyster-packing companies on the Chesapeake, where once there were\nhundreds. Just a few miles across the Chesapeake Bay Bridge from\nAnnapolis, the waters of Kent Narrows, which leads to the bay, were\nhome to 13 oyster packing houses at about the time Harris' opened in\n1947. Now, it stands alone in the shadow of the Kent Narrows Bridge.\n</P>\n<P>\nBut some oysters do survive in the bay. Harris' shucks, packs and\nsells them at its packing company and serves them in its dockside\nrestaurant overlooking the narrows. At the height of oyster season,\nwhich began Oct. 1 and runs through the end of March, Harris' rolls\nout an all-you-can-eat buffet, featuring oysters served seven\ndifferent ways.\n</P>\n<P>\nIndeed, fall oyster celebrations still abound in bayside communities\non the Chesapeake, where old traditions die hard and the oysters\nremain as much a symbol of the season's arrival as cider, apples and\npumpkins. Here, the mighty oyster is toasted in the wood-paneled\noyster bars of Annapolis -- McGarvey's, O'Brien's and the Middleton\nTavern -- and honored along the bay's shores at festivals, shucking\ncontests and skipjack races.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe events spotlighting oysters in October and November unfold like\noysters on the half shell -- by the dozen. There are Tilghman Island\nDay, the J. Millard Tawes Oyster and Bull Roast in Crisfield, the St.\nMichaels Oysterfest, the Urbanna Oyster Festival, and the biggest\npearl of them all for oyster lovers _the St. Mary's County Oyster\nFestival this weekend, home to the National Oyster Shucking\nChampionship and National Oyster Cook-Off Contest. The festival\nfeatures oysters in every imaginable combination: raw, steamed, fried\nor Rockefeller; stewed in chowder or mixed with cocktail sauce; or\nserved with a swig of beer in a shot glass.\n</P>\n<P>\nIt is possible, too, to celebrate the season with a quieter sojourn,\nsteering clear of the crowded festivals and venturing into sleepier\ncoastal communities. From the Kent Narrows, they are a quick jaunt to\nthe far side of the Chesapeake, heading south and east on Route 50,\ndown the thumb print of land dangling between the bay and the\nAtlantic.\n</P>\n<P>\nThis route is frequently clogged with traffic headed toward the\nAtlantic Coast and Maryland's Eastern Shore in the summer months, but\nfewer people stop to explore the other stretch of coast, along the\nChesapeake Bay. The towns along the peninsula's west coast, places\nlike St. Michaels, Oxford and Crisfield, aren't easy to reach down\ntwisting two-lane roads that dead end at the water's edge.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe small flecks of black that mark them on a map can persuade those\nshort on time or unwise in the ways of the bay to save the detour for\nanother day. But if you turn off Route 50 at Easton, and cut west\ntoward the bay, the road quickly gives way to farmland, brown and\ndrying corn stalks, pumpkin patches and fields dipped in gold at the\nhands of fall before opening onto the water.\n</P>\n<P>\nPast Easton and St. Michaels, Tilghman Island is one of those flecks,\nset on the tip of a peninsula connected to the mainland by a\ndrawbridge across Knapp's Narrows. At the clanging of a bell, every\n20 minutes or so, cars stop and the bridge slowly lifts as if raising\na hand in greeting to the boats coming in and out of the harbor. On\none side of the bridge is the Bridge Restaurant, which advertises\noysters with crab imperial, and the Fairbank Tackle store, which\nsells tackle, ice and bait. On the other side is Harrison's Oyster\nPacking, another of the handful of oyster houses still in operation.\nFarther down the road, Captain Buddy Harrison, who owns the company,\nalso runs the Chesapeake House, offering old-fashioned seafood dining\nand lodging overlooking the bay.\n</P>\n<P>\nIn Dogwood Harbor on Tilghman, fishing boats still outnumber\nsailboats and pleasure craft. On a recent Sunday morning, the harbor\nwas peaceful, with only a few watermen cleaning and fixing their\nboats. In an earlier time, they would have been prepping their\ndredges for oyster season, but most won't be dredging this year.\n</P>\n<P>\nNorman Murphy is a middle-aged waterman who grew up on Tilghman\nIsland working the bay, as his own son does now. \"No one here is\noystering anymore,\" he said, shaking his head before adding a\nfootnote. \"Well, maybe a few.\"\n</P>\n<P>\n(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)\n</P>\n<P>\nAcross the harbor from Murphy's slip are a handful of skipjacks -- a\nvanishing fleet of traditional oyster dredge boats and the last\ncommercial sailing fishing fleet in North America. There were once\nalmost 2,000 of the boats working the bay, but today, they number\nnear 30, with only about 10 used for oystering.\n</P>\n<P>\nBuilt at the peak of the oyster rush, in the late 1890s and early\nyears of the 20th century, skipjacks are light, inexpensive boats\nthat can navigate the shallow waters of the bay. They were designed\nto be agile to make multiple quick passes over an oyster bed,\ndragging dredges behind them. Today, oystermen use motorboats more\nthan skipjacks, and they employ other methods, too, like hand-tonging\nand diving.\n</P>\n<P>\nMany of the remaining skipjacks have become museum pieces, like the\nMartha Lewis in Baltimore, preserved by the Chesapeake Heritage\nConservancy, and the E.C. Collier, now in the Chesapeake Bay Maritime\nMuseum in St. Michaels.\n</P>\n<P>\nBut lined up in Dogwood Harbor are four majestic skipjacks growing\nold very, very gracefully, their massive white sails lashed to the\nmasts. They, too, are holdouts, though called upon less and less to\ndredge.\n</P>\n<P>\nWade Murphy, a third-generation waterman with 40 years of oystering\nbehind him, runs charter tours on his skipjack, the Rebecca T. Ruark,\nbuilt in 1886. Each year the charter business gets bigger and bigger,\nMurphy said. \"If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be able to keep\nafloat.\"\n</P>\n<P>\nNearby, D.K. Bond was cleaning out his skipjack, the Mister Maybe,\nwith a vision of running his own tours in the summer and hauling down\nto Florida come winter. \"This boat costs $10,000 a year to keep up,\"\nBond said. \"If you spend $10,000 and make $5,000, it doesn't take\nlong for you to get out of it. I'm going to catch tourists instead.\nIt's easier.\"\n</P>\n<P>\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM)\n</P>\n<P>\nThis grim portrait doesn't mean that there are no oysters left in the\nChesapeake. Both Virginia and Maryland have been spending several\nmillion dollars each year to restore native populations, and they are\nconsidering introducing a heartier nonnative species to the bay.\n</P>\n<P>\nIn 2005, led by the Army Corps of Engineers, the two states are\nexpected to release a draft Environmental Impact Statement evaluating\noyster recovery. Also, the Oyster Recovery Partnership, an alliance\nof organizations, businesses and individuals, has planted more than\n330 million disease-free oyster seeds from the University of\nMaryland's Center for Environmental Science in 33 locations in the\nbay since 2000. The group aims to harvest the seeded oysters in time\nto save them from being attacked by Dermo or MSX, within three years.\n</P>\n<P>\nNonetheless, the commercial fishery business -- the packing and\nshipping that put Chesapeake Bay oysters on the map -- has all but\ncollapsed.\n</P>\n<P>\nBut watermen still bring in salty, succulent oysters every year, and\nthose are abundant at bay restaurants, raw bars, seafood stores and\nfestivals. If you ask, you may find the oysters you order are from\nLong Island or the Gulf of Mexico, but in the height of oyster\nseason, when the annual grind is under way, you are just as likely to\nget that coveted response, \"from a local oyster bed.\"\n</P>\n<P>\nIn places like Tilghman, watermen still motor up to the dock at\nHarrison's packing company to deliver their day's haul, just as they\nhave for generations, and inside, shuckers still wait to crack them\nopen in record time, as they, too, have done for generations.\n</P>\n<P>\nLike the watermen, shuckers are born into this hearty business more\noften than not. Opening a cold, tenacious oyster quickly without\nharming or slicing the tender meat within takes skill and gumption.\nAt the height of the season, shuckers line up in the oyster house,\ndon rugged work gloves and pry open the shells, shucking hundreds an\nhour (they get paid by the pound).\n</P>\n<P>\nClevon Tilghman, 53, has been working at Harrison's since he was a\nboy watching his parents shuck oysters there. \"Young people now don't\nwant to shuck oysters,\" Tilghman said. \"You can tell in the oyster\nhouse. We see the old generation that's passed on, and there's no\nyounger one to take their place. It's fading out.\"\n</P>\n<P>\nWHERE TO GO\n</P>\n<P>\nThe St. Mary's County Oyster Festival, one of the Cheseapeake Bay's\nlargest celebrations, is being held this weekend, Oct. 16-17, at the\nfairgrounds in Leonardtown, Md.\n</P>\n<P>\nIt features a giant raw oyster bar, cooking demonstrations, live\nmusic and an oyster-shucking competition. Admission is $5 over age\n12; www.usoysterfest.com.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe Harris Crab House and Seafood Restaurant in Grasonville, Md.,\noffers waterfront dining overlooking Kent Narrows; inside, the Harris\nfamily displays an old-fashioned oyster can collection\n(www.harriscrabhouse.com, 410-827-9500, 433 Kent Narrows Way North).\n</P>\n<P>\nOn Tilghman Island, Harrison's Chesapeake House serves fried oyster\nsandwiches next to the bay (www.chesapeakehouse.com, 410-886-2121,\n21551 Chesapeake House Drive).\n</P>\n<P>\nThe Wades Point Inn, between St. Michaels and Tilghman Island, is a\nwhite-columned historic inn on 120 acres with stunning views of\nChesapeake Bay (www.wadespoint.com, 410-745-2500, 10090 Wades Point\nRoad, McDaniel, Md.).

            "text": "\n<P>\nYears of paltry oyster harvests have left Bill Beck, a waterman on\nMaryland's Eastern Shore for 21 of his 39 years, wondering if the\nbusiness will exist by the time his 9-year-old son reaches adulthood.\n</P>\n<P>\nHarvesting oysters, crabs or rockfish for 10 to 15 hours a day\nearns Beck just $25,000 a year. The dwindling supply of oysters in the\nChesapeake Bay -- last season's haul was about 24,000 bushels, less\nthan 1 percent of what it was three decades ago -- has hurt him the\nmost.\n</P>\n<P>\n``It's getting worse. There's no oysters. There's nothing there,''\nBeck said.\n</P>\n<P>\nLast weekend, three generations of the Beck family -- Bill, son\nCraig and father John, 76 -- boarded their boat with renewed optimism\nas nearly 4,000 bushels of disease-free oysters were made available\nfor harvesting for the first time since they were hatched and planted\nthree years ago.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe Becks were among two dozen watermen, some scuba-diving and some\nusing hand tongs, who set out to get their share of the disease-free\noysters from three managed reserves, known as Emory Hollow and Blunts\nBar in the Chester River and Bolingbroke Sands in the Choptank River.\nThe oysters were spawned at the University of Maryland's Center for\nEnvironmental Science, then planted in the managed reserves, where\nthey grew under the supervision of scientists. Almost 200 million\noysters have been planted since 2001, officials said.\n</P>\n<P>\nWhile watermen have been able to harvest oysters elsewhere, they\nagreed not to harvest in the managed reserves for several years until\nthe majority of the oysters grew to four inches, one inch bigger than\nthe state's legal size. Those oysters command a higher price and have\na better chance of reproducing, organizers said. In return, state\nofficials promised to open up the oyster bars periodically,\nparticularly around the holidays when demand is higher. The watermen\nwill next be able to harvest oysters, which also help filter the\nwater, at the three sites Nov. 13.\n</P>\n<P>\n``It's a beautiful concept in a sense because it's brought\ncommercial interests and environmental interests together,'' said\nWilliam Goldsborough, a senior scientist at the Chesapeake Bay\nFoundation.\n</P>\n<P>\nYet not everyone left with big bundles of oysters Saturday. At\nEmory Hollow, the seven participating watermen collected just 10 to 15\nbushels. The nine watermen at the Blunts Bar site fared better,\ncollecting 97 bushels.\n</P>\n<P>\n``Terrible,'' Bill Beck said. ``It took us over an hour to catch a\nbushel.'' The Becks had worked diligently along the Chester River,\nBill Beck dragging a hand tong through the water as his son and father\nsorted and measured their catch.\n</P>\n<P>\nMathilde Egge, program administrator for the Oyster Recovery\nPartnership, one of the project managers, said many Emory Hollow\noysters were smaller than four inches and couldn't be harvested.\nOrganizers would try to determine how to ensure that oystermen take\nhome a bigger haul before the next harvesting, Egge said.\n</P>\n<P>\nSeveral organizations and federal agencies worked together to\nmanage the project, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric\nAdministration and the Oyster Recovery Partnership, a nonprofit group\nwhose mission is to restore the bay's oyster population.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe managed reserve program is one of many efforts to reverse what\nscientists have called a disturbing trend. Once the Chesapeake Bay's\npremiere species, native oysters have been virtually wiped out due to\nover-harvesting and disease. In addition to the managed reserve\nprogram, some researchers have turned to creating sanctuaries filled\nwith oysters that watermen are barred from harvesting. The Maryland\nDepartment of Natural Resources also is considering introducing a\nnonnative -- and, they hope, disease-resistant -- species to the bay.\n</P>\n<P>\nFederal funding for oyster restoration efforts in Maryland and\nVirginia exceeded $4 million this year, organizers of Saturday's event\nsaid.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe managed reserve method is ``the beginning of a new approach to\nmanaging oysters and oyster disease,'' said Goldsborough of the\nChesapeake Bay Foundation.\n</P>\n<P>\nDavid Phillips, 42, a waterman from Wittman, Md., said he welcomes\nany effort to increase the oyster supply. Phillips drove his boat 20\nmiles to Emory Hollow, a nearly two-hour trip, to participate.\n</P>\n<P>\n``I think it's a great opportunity,'' said Phillips, who hopes such\nefforts will save his profession.\n</P>\n<P>\n``It's a dying breed,'' Phillips said. ``Everybody that was on the\nwater got off the water because you can't make a living.''\n</P>\n",

            "headline": "Advocates for Bay to Sue EPA", 
            "text": "\n<P>\nThe Chesapeake Bay Foundation will file a lawsuit\nagainst the Environmental Protection Agency Wednesday, signaling a\nmore aggressive strategy for a group that has grown increasingly\nfrustrated over the slow progress in cleaning up the bay.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe lawsuit, a copy of which was released Tuesday, accuses the\nfederal agency of dragging its feet as sewage plants across the region\npollute the bay's waters. Specifically, the suit asks that the EPA\nrespond formally to the bay foundation petition submitted in December\nseeking limits on the amount of nitrogen released from such plants.\n</P>\n<P>\n``Our only recourse is to litigate,'' said William C. Baker, the\nbay foundation's president. ``We've tried ... to give EPA a chance to\nfulfill its promises.''\n</P>\n<P>\nThe suit is one of several recent legal steps initiated by\nenvironmental groups, which traditionally have relied on consensus,\nrather than confrontation, with government agencies in the effort to\nclean up the bay.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe foundation already is suing Virginia over what it believes were\nlax pollution permits issued for a sewage plant in Onancock and a\nPhilip Morris industrial plant. And Maryland watermen are considering\na class-action lawsuit against polluters, including sewage treatment\nplants and manufacturers that dump into the bay's watershed.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe key issue in the legal action to be filed Wednesday is\nnitrogen, which along with phosphorus serves as food for huge algae\nblooms in the bay. Scientists blame these algae for creating ``bad\nwater'' where fish and crabs cannot breathe.\n</P>\n<P>\nFor those trying to clean the bay, the problem is that nitrogen\ncomes from everywhere, including from animal manure that washes off\nfarm fields and from leaky septic systems. The more than 350 sewage\nplants in the Chesapeake Bay watershed account for about 21 percent of\nits nitrogen, according to the EPA.\n</P>\n<P>\nIn its petition filed in December, the bay foundation noted that\nalmost none of those sewage plants had permits that limited nitrogen\npollution and asked the EPA to remedy that.\n</P>\n<P>\nEPA regulators responded with a draft proposal that eventually\nwould impose such permits on most of the plants. That plan, if\nauthorized by EPA leaders, could be implemented by spring, agency\nofficials said Tuesday.\n</P>\n<P>\n``There's no disagreement with the bay foundation that this is a\nnecessary next step,'' said Jon Capacasa, an official at the EPA\nregional office that oversees the bay.\n</P>\n<P>\nBut the federal agency has not provided a formal answer to the bay\nfoundation's demands, and Baker said the draft proposal contains\n``weasel words'' that might allow the EPA to back out of key\nprovisions.\n</P>\n<P>\nSo the bay foundation decided to go to court, asking a federal\njudge in Washington D.C. to speed up the EPA's formal response.\n</P>\n<P>\nBaker said that environmentalists are frustrated that the bay has\nmade so little progress in the three decades since the cleanup began,\nand particularly in the four years since the signing of the landmark\nChesapeake 2000 agreement.\n</P>\n<P>\nThat agreement -- signed by the EPA, the D.C. mayor and the\ngovernors of Maryland, Virginia and Pennsylvania -- set a goal of\nremoving the Chesapeake from the national ``impaired waters'' list by\n2010. With nearly half the time gone, most of the efforts are still in\nthe planning stages, and Baker said his organization has lost patience\nwith the EPA.\n</P>\n<P>\n``We think that 41/2 years is enough time to determine that they\nare not interested'' in moving more quickly, he said.\n</P>\n<P>\nStill, some observers, including Bill Matuszeski, who formerly\noversaw the EPA's Chesapeake cleanup effort, worry that lawsuits might\nbog down the process further. ``Tying this whole issue up in court\nisn't going to move it forward at all,'' he said.\n</P>\n",

            "text": "\n<P>\nFor weeks this fall, even as St. Mary's County celebrated the\nbeginning of oyster season with festivals and contests, Tucker and\nAgnes Brown couldn't find oysters. Most days, the stainless steel\nsinks and tables inside their shuck house were shining, untouched.\n</P>\n<P>\nLeaves yellowed and crab apples fell, and often the radio played\ncountry songs to no one, echoing through the empty cinderblock\nbuilding.\n</P>\n<P>\n``We're dead in the water,'' Tucker Brown said.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe decline of the region's oyster population has changed life on\nthe water, but the Browns keep looking ahead. Maybe the government\nwill bring in a new kind of oyster that can survive in the bay. Or\nmaybe, once again, they'll think of something new with which to patch\ntheir business together.\n</P>\n<P>\nFor decades, the Browns, like most watermen, have adapted as\ndiseases, pollution and commercial fisheries have taken their toll on\nthe Chesapeake Bay and its rivers. Oysters, an important filter for\nthe water and once the mainstay of the region's fishing industry, have\nbeen decimated, their numbers dropping to historic lows.\n</P>\n<P>\nIn the 1970s and '80s, before diseases started their rampant spread\nthrough the bay, the average harvest reported to the Maryland\nDepartment of Natural Resources was more than 2 million bushels. This\nyear, DNR officials expect about 15,000. Just a few years ago, there\nwere thousands of people oystering in Maryland; this year, they expect\nfewer than 150.\n</P>\n<P>\nIn 1987, the Virginia Marine Resources Commission issued more than\n2,000 licenses for oystering; in 2003, it issued about 300. And on the\nPotomac -- famous for its Oyster Wars five or six decades ago, when\nshots were fired over fishing rights and fast boats slipped past the\nauthorities at night -- little or no harvest is anticipated this year.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe effects are deeply felt in St. Mary's, where so much of life\nonce revolved around oysters. Generations of watermen worked long\nwinter days gathering them; shuckers spent nights cracking them open;\nfamilies scalded, fried, steamed and ate them.\n</P>\n<P>\nAt the Blessing of the Fleet, where for decades St. Mary's\nresidents have marked the beginning of the season, there were hardly\nany workboats to sanctify this year. And at the recent St. Mary's\nCounty Oyster Festival, which draws thousands and crowns a national\nshucking champion, organizers had to ship in shellfish from Texas and\nLouisiana.\n</P>\n<P>\nIn the past two years, the Browns have shifted more and more to\nbuying from the Gulf of Mexico. This year, even the gulf couldn't fill\ntheir early orders after heavy rains closed some oyster beds.\n</P>\n<P>\nBy early next year, state and federal agencies expect to complete\nresearch on restoring the native oyster to the Chesapeake Bay. The\nstudies will also examine the potential impact of introducing a new\nspecies of oyster that appears resistant to the diseases.\n</P>\n<P>\nSome scientists worry they won't have answers that quickly, but the\nBrowns are tired of waiting. ``If something goes wrong, what's any\nworse than what we've got?'' Tucker Brown asked.\n</P>\n<P>\nHe said if the scientists don't start putting the non-native oyster\ninto Maryland waters soon, someone else could throw some overboard.\n</P>\n<P>\n``We have to try to make it work,'' he said. The bay needs oysters.\n``When one part of it dies, you have to figure out, how am I going to\nget to another part?''\n</P>\n<P>\n(optional trim starts here)\n</P>\n<P>\nThat's how it's always been in Avenue, a St. Mary's neighborhood\nwith stacks of just-chopped firewood, sheds, wheelbarrows and tarps.\nSt. Patrick Creek curls around the Browns' land, with family and\nfriends living along both shores. People remember favors there.\n</P>\n<P>\nTucker Brown grew up a waterman in a family of watermen, and in his\n67 years, he said, he's just about tried it all.\n</P>\n<P>\nHe's fished. He's eeled. He's dropped pots for crabs. He's helped\nmove seed out of hatcheries to oyster bars, and he's kept a hand in\nthe Maryland Watermen's Association. He's hopeful about aquaculture.\n</P>\n<P>\n(optional trim ends here)\n</P>\n<P>\nOut on the water, the oysters have kept dying.\n</P>\n<P>\n``It started to dwindle down, and then it just, like -- dropped,''\nsaid Kim Beveridge, 38, the Browns' middle daughter, who works with\nher parents in the shuck house. ``It dropped so bad. Suddenly, nobody\nhad it. Dad wasn't able to fill his orders.''\n</P>\n<P>\nThis year, even the harvest of gulf oysters was stalled by storms.\n</P>\n<P>\n``We're desperate,'' Agnes Brown said one morning this fall when\npeople kept calling and knocking on their door, looking for oysters,\nand the couple spent much of the night driving to deliver bait. ``Some\ndays I sit here, I don't want to do this anymore. ... But you know\nwhat's behind you. Just look ahead. ... You find something else to\ntake its place.''\n</P>\n<P>\nFinally, this week, they got a shipment. On Wednesday morning,\nshuckers stood on wooden boxes, spraying mud as they pried open\noysters, dropping the slippery meat into dripping pails. Beveridge\nshoveled ice around jars of sealed oysters. Toogie Copsey of\nMechanicsville, Md., who works for the Browns, smashed shells down a\nmetal chute with a long pole, clearing space to shuck some more.\n</P>\n<P>\nTucker Brown pulled off his rubber apron and gloves to check on the\nempty shells pouring out as his wife walked in with a clipboard of\norders. For now, they're busy. And just in case, they're thinking of\nideas for a new business -- another try.\n</P>\n<P>\nStaff researcher Bobbye Pratt contributed to this report.\n</P>\n",

Nutria\nwere introduced there when a few of the South American animals either\nescaped or were released from a federal fur research project in 1943.\n</P>\n<P>\nFor the nutria, which resemble waddling beavers with naked tails,\nthe area turned out to be a garden spot. There were huge expanses of a\nmarsh plant they love, called three-square bulrush.\n</P>\n<P>\nFor the bulrush, and the numerous species of birds, fish and\nmammals that lived in the bulrush marshes, the news wasn't so good.\nNutria act like a ``mammalian lawn mower,'' in the words of scientist\nRobert Thomas, a professor at Loyola University in New Orleans --\neating the plants, roots and all, and leaving huge stretches of bare\nmud.\n</P>\n<P>\nWithout roots to hold it, in many places the mud simply washed\naway. About half of the refuge's marshland, a crucial pollution filter\nthat scientists call the ``kidneys'' of the Chesapeake, had become\nopen water by the 1990s.\n</P>\n<P>\nAuthorities first offered rewards to trappers who caught nutria:\n$1.50 apiece. But when nutria became difficult to find, trappers\ndecided the rodent wasn't worth their time. Any remaining animals --\nblessed with an ability to produce more than 10 young in a year --\nwould then quickly repopulate.\n</P>\n<P>\n``It's sort of like a whack-a-mole game,'' said Steve Kendrot, the\nDepartment of Agriculture official in charge of Blackwater's trapping\nefforts.\n</P>\n<P>\nGovernment officials also tried to make nutria into a dinner-table\ndelicacy. That, too, failed: People who will eat nutria are pretty\nmuch the same people who eat muskrat -- not much of a mass market.\n</P>\n<P>\n``There's just not a lot of people out there who can stomach\nthem,'' said Dan Murphy of the Fish and Wildlife Service's Chesapeake\noffice.\n</P>\n<P>\nIncluding him: ``I don't eat rat,'' Murphy said.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe idea behind the recent eradication effort was to use full-time\ntrappers, paid by the hour and not by the nutria. The trappers would\nact like a conquering army, slowly taking territory in a west-to-east\nmarch that was guided by GBS equipment.\n</P>\n<P>\nIn the summer, the trappers had to fend off mosquitoes and biting\ngreenhead flies. There were also spiders and the danger of the\noccasional bite from a nutria's inch-long orange buckteeth.\n</P>\n<P>\nWinter in the marsh, while often frigid, turned out to be the easy\nseason. Once the water froze, the nutria couldn't swim away, and\ntrappers could shoot them by the dozens on the ice.\n</P>\n<P>\n``There's really about two months of the year when this is a\npleasant occupation,'' Kendrot said.\n</P>\n<P>\nThis September, the anti-nutria team got the news they were waiting\nfor: Surveys showed they had effectively cleared the animals from more\nthan 35,000 acres in and around Blackwater.\n</P>\n<P>\nAs it turned out, the nutria death toll had been much lower than\nthey expected, since early speculation was that 50,000 ``nutes'' were\nin the refuge. Scientists say the rest were killed by recent cold\nwinters or by a decline in food, as so much of the marsh already was\neaten. With the nutria gone, the marsh is starting to look the way it\ndid 70 years ago, officials said.\n</P>\n<P>\n(Begin optional trim) \n</P>\n<P>\nOfficials in Maryland said they hope their success can be a model\nfor the roughly 16 other states with nutria problems.\n</P>\n<P>\nBut in Louisiana, the only state with a bigger nutria population\nthan Maryland's, authorities said they doubted whether a similar\neradication was possible there. Millions of nutria are in that swampy\nstate, and trappers routinely match the catch at Blackwater, about\n8,300, in a couple of days.\n</P>\n<P>\nIn Maryland, authorities say they want to slowly expand their\nnutria-free zone to include the rest of the Eastern Shore, where tens\nof thousands more nutria lurk between the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and\nOcean City. The whole effort will require millions more in funding and\nmany more trappers, officials said.\n</P>\n<P>\n``It was a major battle that has, for the most part, been won,''\nsaid Jacoby Carter, a national expert on nutria for the U.S.\nGeological Survey. ``But you've got to worry about the guerrilla\nwarfare.''\n</P>\n",

            "text": "\n<P>\nThe sun had just risen over the Patuxent\nRiver when the crew of the Aquarius launched its routine: casting a\n30-foot net off the trawler's bow, hauling it in and flinging its\ncontents of writhing fish and crabs onto a wooden slab. Members\nmeasured each creature and weighed it, then headed back to the lab to\ndissect each one and study what it had eaten.\n</P>\n<P>\nIt's a ritual that scientists and anglers have performed for ages\nin an effort to understand the world beneath the water's surface.\n</P>\n<P>\nBut what happens to the data collected on the Aquarius is totally\nnew, a small part of an ongoing revolution in how humans manage marine\nlife. The new way of thinking comes after the numbers of cod, scallops\nand oysters have declined precipitously.\n</P>\n<P>\n``Many people feel fisheries management has generally failed to\npreserve fish, and they're looking to a`new holy grail,'' said Michael\nOrbach, who teaches marine policy at Duke University and has advised\nthe government on fisheries management and conflicts.\n</P>\n<P>\nGovernment regulators had set population targets for each species\nand type separately, aiming only to maintain certain numbers. But now\nregulators say they want to manage the nation's fisheries as one big\necosystem, basing their targets on many elements, including the diet\nof water birds, the quality of the water and whether predator fish\nhave enough prey.\n</P>\n<P>\n``Our classical approaches have been like trying to understand\ntraffic problems by focusing on the cars without focusing on the\nroad,'' said Thomas Miller, an ecologist with the University of\nMaryland's Chesapeake Biological Laboratory.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe epicenter of the movement is the Chesapeake Bay, where federal\nregulators are launching a test case for ``ecosystem-based\nmanagement.'' At issue are two of the nation's most important fish:\nthe striped bass and the Atlantic menhaden. Each has its champions.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe bass spawn in the bay and are favorites of gourmets and\nrecreational anglers, who bring the bay area about $500 million a\nyear.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe menhaden -- an oily, inedible, bony little fish -- is the basis\nof this country's second-largest commercial fishing industry. It is\nused in a variety of products from cattle feed to vitamin supplements.\nAbout a third of the menhaden caught in the United States are caught\nin Virginia and off the North Carolina coast, the two East Coast\nstates that allow menhaden processing.\n</P>\n<P>\nAs a key source of food for other fish and a major filter for the\nalgae and other particles in the bay, the menhaden ``ecologically\nspeaking, (is) the most important animal'' in the bay, the Chesapeake\nBay Foundation says.\n</P>\n<P>\n``We should look at menhaden as a keystone of the Chesapeake Bay,\nrather than a little, oily, bony thing out of which you can make cat\nfood,'' said David Festa, director of the Oceans Program at the\nEnvironmental Defense Fund.\n</P>\n<P>\nMany conservation and anglers groups accuse the menhaden industry,\nwhich uses spotter planes to locate schools, of catching too many fish\n-- starving the striped bass and upsetting the bay ecosystem.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe industry has responded by blaming the bass. As their numbers\ngrow, industry officials said, bass are eating too many menhaden.\n</P>\n<P>\nAs federal biologists begin to test ecosystem-based management, the\ndebate around menhaden and bass is heating up. Conservation and\nanglers' groups each have said they are sure the new approach will\nprove their points.\n</P>\n<P>\nIndustry advocates said that they also favor viewing the fisheries\nas one interconnected system but that current data aren't sufficient\nto limit fishing for menhaden in the bay.\n</P>\n<P>\nAdvocates who last were together 20 years ago, when declining\nstocks of striped bass prompted an East Coast ban on catching the\nfish, are reuniting to take on the menhaden industry.\n</P>\n<P>\n``I never thought I'd be back fighting this fight,'' said Dick\nRussell, a Los Angeles writer who was fishing for striped bass off\nMartha's Vineyard in the 1980s when he was sucked into the striper\nmovement. His book ``Striper Wars: An American Fish Story'' will be\nreleased next year.\n</P>\n<P>\nIn the past couple of years, Russell again has started attending\nmeetings of the federal Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission\nand has reunited with advocate friends during Chesapeake Bay fishing\ntrips.\n</P>\n<P>\nKen Hinman, 52, was living in Savannah, Ga., when he joined the\nfight to limit the striped bass catch 20 years ago. Today he is\npresident of a Leesburg, Va.-based anglers' group, the National\nCoalition for Marine Conservation.\n</P>\n<P>\n``A lot of people have come back to try and address these issues,''\nhe said.\n</P>\n<P>\nAll the players were at the table last month at fisheries\ncommission meeting in which conservationists pressed the agency to\nlimit the menhaden catch.\n</P>\n<P>\nBut the commission refused, citing a dearth of data linking bass\nand menhaden.\n</P>\n<P>\n``Right now, we just don't know. We don't have enough\ninformation,'' said Nancy Wallace, the commission's coordinator for\nmenhaden management. ``We don't have any other models of (ecosystem\nbased management) to go off of. This is a new thing.''\n</P>\n<P>\nThe industry has said that the matter centers on social priorities\nand that menhaden farming is an important business.\n</P>\n<P>\n``Why shouldn't the striped bass be managed for the benefit of the\nmenhaden?'' said Toby Gascon, director of government affairs for Omega\nProtein Corp., which produces oil and feed from menhaden and is the\nlargest employer in Virginia's Northern Neck. ``Special-interest\ngroups are trying to twist this to get the outcome they want and will\ngive ecosystem-based management a bad name.''\n</P>\n<P>\nTo Dave Loewensteiner, chief scientist aboard the Aquarius,\neverything is at stake.\n</P>\n<P>\n``If we don't do ecosystem-based, we may as well give up,'' he\nsaid. ``But it's part getting the data and part the will, since no one\nhas done this before. A lot is on the line.''\n</P>\n",

That study, performed by the U.S. Army Corps\nof Engineers, could be finished in the next couple of weeks, he said.\n</P>\n<P>\nAfter that, Franks said, the data will be reviewed by a panel of\nexperts appointed by Ehrlich and Virginia Gov.

            "text": "\n<P>\nThe leaders of several states in the Chesapeake Bay watershed\nagreed Monday to lobby Capitol Hill for about $12 billion for cleaning\nup the bay.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe Chesapeake Executive Council, a group of state and federal\nofficials overseeing the bay cleanup, voted to support a new central\nfinancing authority with the power to disperse billions to various\nChesapeake-related projects. The idea is to jump-start the massive\ncleanup effort, which critics say has been bogged down because of\nexcessive bureaucracy and insufficient funding.\n</P>\n<P>\nBut supporting the financing authority doesn't make it so: There's\nstill the matter of persuading Congress to come up with the bulk of\nthe $15 billion needed to pay for the plan.\n</P>\n<P>\nVirginia Gov. Mark R. Warner (D), the Chesapeake executive\ncouncil's outgoing chairman, said the lobbying effort would begin\nsoon.\n</P>\n<P>\n``We will be up in the halls of Congress within the next 45 days to\nlobby for the additional federal support,'' Warner said. He said the\nChesapeake officials had been told to wait until after last fall's\nnational elections to launch their efforts.\n</P>\n<P>\nMonday's annual meeting, at a conference center on the grounds of\nMount Vernon, Va., provided a chance for officials from Virginia,\nMaryland, Pennsylvania, the District of Columbia and the U.S.\nEnvironmental Protection Agency to assess the bay's health.\n</P>\n<P>\nAll noted some signs of progress: a new ``flush tax'' to improve\nsewer facilities in Maryland and rivers in Pennsylvania that have been\nreopened to migrating fish.\n</P>\n<P>\nBut most also said the cleanup effort was not close to meeting a\nself-imposed deadline of a healthy bay by 2010.\n</P>\n<P>\nThat goal, set in the landmark Chesapeake 2000 agreement five years\nago, would require huge reductions that have yet to be seen in several\npollutants. In fact, experts say by some measures -- such as the\ndeclining oyster population and large areas of oxygen-poor ``bad\nwater'' -- the bay seems to be getting worse.\n</P>\n<P>\n``Without major funding, there's no way we're going to meet that\n2010 goal,'' said Pennsylvania Gov. Edward G. Rendell (D), the\ncouncil's new chairman.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe regional financing authority was proposed late last year by a\npanel of experts chaired by former Virginia Gov. Gerald L.

It called for a central authority with 20 percent of its funding\ndrawn from state sources and 80 percent from the federal government.\n</P>\n<P>\nAs drawn up by the Baliles panel, the federal commitment would be\nspread over time, beginning with $1 billion this year and building to\n$2.5 billion in 2010.\n</P>\n<P>\nThat would be a major increase over current funding for the bay,\nwhich Warner estimated at $230 million annually.\n</P>\n<P>\nAs lobbying efforts begin, the executive council voted to create a\npanel of experts which would report back by July1 with details on how\nthe regional financing authority might be created.\n</P>\n<P>\nBefore the meeting, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation led a rally in\nwhich speakers accused government officials of dragging their feet on\nbay cleanup measures.\n</P>\n<P>\nWilliam C.

            "text": "\n<P>\nHalfway through a 10-year program to save the Chesapeake Bay,\npolitical leaders are acknowledging that the vaunted cleanup is\nfaltering and are calling for major changes midstream.\n</P>\n<P>\nOnce touted as a national model, the cleanup effort has unraveled\ninto what some environmentalists call a bureaucratic farce. Five years\nof planning, they say, have left the bay no cleaner than it was when\nthe ``Chesapeake 2000'' pact was signed.\n</P>\n<P>\nA Maryland congressman is contemplating legislation to replace the\nvoluntary cleanup strategy with strict regulatory requirements.\nGovernors are pledging to walk the halls of Congress lobbying for $12\nbillion in needed support. And scientists are exploring the mass\nintroduction of a Chinese oyster to replace the vanishing native\nbreed.\n</P>\n<P>\n``Business as usual won't work,'' said former Virginia Gov. Gerald\nBaliles, who led a committee that studied the bay cleanup last year.\n``More of the same is asking for trouble.''\n</P>\n<P>\nThe agreement to clean the bay in 10 years promised twice as much\nunderwater grass, 10 times as many oysters, and water as pristine as\nin the 1950s. It was touted as ``America's premier watershed\nrestoration partnership,'' supported by the Environmental Protection\nAgency and representatives from Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia and\nWashington, D.C.\n</P>\n<P>\nThirteen years before, the same entities had pledged to reduce the\npollutants nitrogen and phosphorus in the bay by 40 percent. When the\ndeadline came in 2000, they had fallen short.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe new agreement, an attempt to jump-start the effort, made more\nsweeping promises.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe idea was, ``if we can do this ... nobody else in the world has\nan excuse,'' said William Matuszeski, who was then overseeing the bay\ncleanup for the EPA.\n</P>\n<P>\nIt was a daunting task: to reduce pollution spewing from a\nmultitude of city sewers, farms and factories across a\n64,000-square-mile watershed. The tools were unwieldy, including\nseveral federal agencies and an array of state governments that\neventually included Delaware, West Virginia and New York.\n</P>\n<P>\nEven so, cleanup officials say, they expected to accomplish more by\nnow than they have.\n</P>\n<P>\n``We've made only modest progress,'' Rebecca Hanmer, head of the\nEPA bay program, conceded in a recent interview.\n</P>\n<P>\nConsider:\n</P>\n<P>\n-- The 2000 agreement targeted the problem of low dissolved oxygen,\na condition in which fish and crabs can't breathe. This would mean\nreducing nitrogen and phosphorus, found in suburban lawn fertilizer,\nprocessed sewage and animal manure. These pollutants, when washed\ndownstream to the bay, feed algae blooms that suck oxygen out of the\nwater.\n</P>\n<P>\nBut at the current rate, the nitrogen goal won't be met until 2038,\nand problems with oxygen-poor areas haven't changed. The summer of\n2003 was one of the worst on record, as nearly 40 percent of the\nChesapeake became a suffocating expanse that environmentalists dubbed\nthe ``dead zone.''\n</P>\n<P>\n-- The agreement promised to increase the number of oysters tenfold.\nInstead, their numbers have fallen off sharply because of pollution,\nlow oxygen and endemic disease. In five years alone, the Maryland\noyster harvest has dropped 92 percent, hitting a record low last year\nwith 26,000 bushels.\n</P>\n<P>\n-- Underwater grasses are supposed to grow to 185,000 acres by 2010.\nBut algae and sediment cloud the water, blocking sunlight. A survey of\nthe bay's grasses in 2003, found about 64,000 acres -- 35 percent of\nthe goal.\n</P>\n<P>\nSome scientists and watermen say the bay shows few signs that\nanybody has spent five years trying to save it.\n</P>\n<P>\n``There really hasn't been a noticeable improvement,'' said Denise\nBreitburg, a senior scientist at the Smithsonian Environmental\nResearch Center in Edgewater, Md. ``The major problems that the\nChesapeake Bay agreement was designed to diminish are still there.''\n</P>\n<P>\nThe Chesapeake Bay Foundation assesses the bay's overall health\nannually and rates it on a 100-point scale. In 2000, the foundation\nrated the bay a 28.\n</P>\n<P>\nSince then, the rating has changed -- to 27.\n</P>\n<P>\n``I wouldn't hold it up as a success story, put it that way,'' said\necologist Robert Howarth of Cornell University.\n</P>\n<P>\n(Begin optional trim) \n</P>\n<P>\nThe consequences are even more troubling for watermen, for whom the\nbay provides both a livelihood and cultural touchstone.\n</P>\n<P>\nDouglas Jenkins Sr., 70, of Virginia's Northern Neck, said he's\nseen the signs both on land -- where the number of watermen has dropped\nbecause of low oyster harvests -- and in the water.\n</P>\n<P>\nFor instance, boat anchors used to come up with a menagerie of tiny\nbottom-dwelling animals crawling on them: sand fleas, worms, snails.\nThose animals are gone, and probably dead, Jenkins said.\n</P>\n<P>\n``The little shells or carcasses are about all you see,'' Jenkins\nsaid.\n</P>\n<P>\n(End trim) \n</P>\n<P>\nHow did the bay get to this condition? Experts say the problem was\na desire to plan all pollution efforts in minute detail while keeping\nmajor changes on hold.\n</P>\n<P>\nMatuszeski, the bay program's leader from 1991 to 2001, said\nofficials knew their work would revolve around renovating sewage\nplants and keeping farm manure out of streams.\n</P>\n<P>\nBut first, the bay cleanup bureaucracy worked on official water\nstandards -- figuring out exactly how clean the bay should be. That\nprocess was supposed to take one year. It took three, with Washington,\nthe states and the federal government spending a combined $1 billion a\nyear.\n</P>\n<P>\nThen individual jurisdictions were to write detailed plans for\ncleaning up each tributary. The plans, due by 2002, still aren't\nfinished.\n</P>\n<P>\n``We could have gotten to work,'' Matuszeski said. ``It didn't\nhappen because people were afraid that we didn't have the numbers\nright.''\n</P>\n<P>\nSome environmentalists say this planning marathon was actually\nstalling to allow politicians to avoid changes that would anger\nfarmers and sewage customers.\n</P>\n<P>\nHanmer, the EPA's bay director, defended the work, saying it's been\nslow but necessary for all the cooperating agencies to buy in. ``Now\npeople cannot say, 'Rebecca, we don't know what needs to be done,' ''\nshe said.\n</P>\n<P>\nHanmer pointed to some recent successes, including Maryland's\npassage of a ``flush tax'' to reduce pollution from sewage plants and\nthe EPA's requirement that plants must further clean the water they\ndump into the watershed.\n</P>\n<P>\nBut even she wouldn't say the cleanup effort is on pace to meet the\n2010 deadline.\n</P>\n<P>\n``I'm certainly not going to tell you that we can't meet it,''\nHanmer said. ``I don't think it's the right message to send.''\n</P>\n<P>\nRep. Wayne Gilchrest, R-Md., doesn't want to wait for 2010.\nGilchrest wants legislation that would force the cleanup to spend less\ntime on bureaucracy, as well as stronger regulations and punishment\nfor those who pollute, he said.\n</P>\n<P>\n``What we want to do is lock in a better bay program that will be a\nhundred times more effective,'' Gilchrest said. Still, he said, it\nmight be two years before the changes go through.\n</P>\n<P>\nState governors from around the watershed have approved a proposal\nthat would create a massive new pool of funding for the bay, with $12\nbillion from the federal government. But many observers wonder how the\nstates will get the money since the federal government is already\ntightening budgets.\n</P>\n<P>\nThen there is the Chinese oyster, which governors in Maryland and\nVirginia believe might resist disease and provide a natural pollution\nfilter.
