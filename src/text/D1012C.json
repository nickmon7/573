			"text":" High in the skies above the Aegean Sea, two Greek fighter pilots nudged their F-16s to either side of a Cypriot passenger jet and quickly discerned the disaster that was unfolding. They saw a cockpit in turmoil. One of the Cypriot pilots sat slumped over the instrument panel. The other was not visible at all. Two other people desperately tried to gain control of the plane. Oxygen masks dangled in the cabin. Less than an hour later, Helios Airways Flight 522 bound for Athens slammed into the side of a wooded Greek hill Sunday, killing all 121 people aboard. About one-third of the dead were children. The worst airline crash in Greek history is also one of the most mysterious. Incapacitation of both pilots on a commercial jetliner is extremely rare. It suggests multiple malfunctions that happened either too quickly or too subtly for the pilots to be aware of them or to act in time to remedy them, aviation experts said. Greek and Cypriot officials said Sunday that, while nothing could be ruled out, it appeared unlikely that terrorism was involved. In addition, there were no signs of a hijacking, such as a distress call, the officials said. ``We have no indication whatsoever that this was a terrorist act,'' Cypriot Transport Minister Harris Thrassou said in a televised news conference at the Lanarca Airport, where the flight originated. Instead, the leading theory about what went wrong on the Boeing 737 was a catastrophic loss of cabin pressure that would have starved the pilots and passengers of oxygen. One pilot reportedly had complained of trouble with the plane's air-conditioning system early in the flight. At altitudes above 30,000 feet, a sudden decompression could plunge the temperature inside the plane below zero, and those aboard could begin to experience hypoxia and loss of consciousness within 10 to 30 seconds unless they were able to put on emergency oxygen masks, aviation experts say. The F-16s intercepted the Helios flight at 34,000 feet, officials said. If this is what happened, it still does not explain how or why these systems failed, and whether the pilots were alerted by alarms that are standard equipment on jetliners. Most of the people on board may have been dead or unconscious for the last hour or so that the plane traveled, on automatic pilot, until crashing, a civil aviation official in Athens said. The two who entered the cockpit to attempt to control the plane may have been crew or passengers, a government official said. Their identity was not clear, nor how long they were able to sustain their efforts. The decompression scenario was reminiscent of the 1999 crash that killed U.S. golfer Payne Stewart, whose plane flew for nearly five hours after a sudden loss of cabin pressure killed or disabled all on board. With its windows iced over, the plane finally plummeted into a field in South Dakota. But that aircraft was a small Learjet, not a commercial airliner, which has numerous back-up systems. ``Although there are precedents for both pilots losing consciousness, for it to happen on a large airliner like a Boeing 737 with all the back-up systems they have does seem to be really quite extraordinary,'' Kieran Daly, editor of Air Transport Intelligence, said in an interview with CNN. ``If the crew had any indication at all of any problem (with air systems) they would immediately be on very robust emergency systems. How that did not happen (with the Helios flight) is extremely strange.'' Sudden loss of cabin pressure would trigger a loud horn and caution lights, said John J. Nance, an air safety analyst and former Air Force and commercial pilot. ``You're not going to miss this anyway because you're ears are going to start popping,'' he said. ``There's a lot here that doesn't make sense,'' said Nance, who added: ``Provided the information from the fighter pilot is right, then we have a high, high probability that we had a malfunctioning crew oxygen system, that the crew didn't know it in time.'' He noted that drop-down oxygen masks provided in the passenger cabin are not powerful enough to sustain consciousness for very long. It also was unclear whether why the Helios plane eventually lost altitude and crashed; one possibility was that it ran out of fuel. In Sunday's crash, scorched debris, suitcases and bodies were scattered down the side of a hill and across a ravine 25 miles north of Athens. A piece of the tail and a wheel from the landing gear were intact and recognizable. The impact ignited fires in the dry brush. One report from the scene said some of the bodies were wearing orange oxygen masks. A man who said his cousin was on board reported receiving a mobile telephone text message from him shortly before the crash, saying the captain had ``turned blue'' and temperatures in the cabin had plummeted. ''Cousin farewell, we're freezing,`` the passenger messaged, according to Alpha TV, a Greek network. The authenticity of the message could not be verified, but the description would be in keeping with drastic loss of cabin pressure. By Sunday afternoon, rescue workers at the site of the crash had recovered the so-called black boxes that contain recordings of flight data and the pilots' voices, said Akrivos Tsolakis, head of the Greek airline safety commission. At airports in Lanarca, Athens and Prague, the flight's final destination, distraught families spent long hours with little information and rising anxiety. Especially at Lanarca, angry relatives blasted Helios for providing information too slowly and scuffled with police while trying to storm the airline's offices. The dead included 48 Greek Cypriot children and youths on a holiday school trip to Prague, a spokesman for Helios said. Most of the passengers and crew were Greek Cypriot, the spokesman said. A Boeing Co. spokeswoman said the company had dispatched a team of experts to join the investigation. The plane that went down was manufactured seven years ago and delivered to Helios in April 2004. Shortly after takeoff Sunday morning, the Helios pilot radioed to ground control in Lanarca that he was having trouble with the air conditioning, Greek officials said. That was the last contact. The plane crossed into Greek airspace about half an hour later, around 9:30 a.m. Athens air traffic controllers began attempting to contact the plane at 10:07 a.m. to initiate landing procedures, but received no response. The attempts continued until 10:55, when the lack of communication triggered Greek emergency procedures known as ''renegade alert``: the Greek air force scrambled two F-16 fighters to escort the plane to its landing. The F-16 pilots, flanking the Helios aircraft, saw an unconscious co-pilot and no captain in the cockpit, Greek government spokesman Theodoros Roussopoulos said in a briefing for reporters in Athens. They noticed that the oxygen masks had deployed inside the cabin and, a few minutes later, saw two people enter the cockpit to attempt to gain control of the doomed flight, Roussopoulos said. The presence of these two was especially mysterious, since by all appearances most of the other occupants of Flight 522 were incapacitated. ''When a pilot has no communication with the control tower, the procedure dictates that other planes must accompany and help the plane land,`` Thrassou, the Cypriot transport minister, said. ''Unfortunately, it appeared that the pilot was already dead, as was, possibly, everyone else on the plane.`` Times staff writer Elizabeth Douglass in Los Angeles contributed to this report. "

			"text":" A Cypriot Helios Airways Boeing 737 jetliner with 115 passengers and six crew members on board crashed Sunday north of Athens, Greek news media reported. Media reports quoted sources with the Defense Ministry and fire department as saying that the plane crashed at about 12:20 p.m. (0920 GMT) near the coastal town of Grammatikos, about 40 kilometers north of the capital city of Athens. Athens radio quoted eyewitnesses as saying that the plane was being accompanied by two Greek fighter jets when it went down. The cause for the crash is yet to be known. The flight was headed from the Cypriot city of Larnaca to Athens International Airport. After losing contact with the Athens airport's control tower, the Greek air force immediately sent two F-16 fighter jets to lead the airliner. Greek radio and television stations reported that the air force pilots in the two fighter jets did not see any movement in the cockpit of the airliner before the crash and it was unclear if the two pilots were in their seats. The plane did not respond to radio calls. One of the pilots appeared to have fallen ill or unconscious, according to reports. "

			"text":" 121 ARE KILLED AS JETLINER CRASHES NORTH OF ATHENS Anthee Carassava reported from Athens, Greece, for this article, and Ian Fisher from Prague, Czech Republic, and Rome. Matthew L. Wald contributed reporting from Washington. ATHENS, Greece -- A Cypriot passenger plane with 121 people on board crashed Sunday just north of the Greek capital, after being shadowed for 43 helpless minutes by fighter jets reporting that the co-pilot was slumped over the controls and that there was no sign of the pilot. Two Greek fighter pilots, peering into the plane, saw \"a lifeless cockpit,\" according to a Greek air force spokesman, even though the Helios Air Boeing 737 continued flying, apparently on autopilot, for nearly three-quarters of an hour before it slammed into a wooded, uninhabited gorge near the town of Grammatikos at 12:03 p.m. There were no survivors in what officials called Greece's worst airline accident. Helios airline officials refused to release the passenger list but said 48 of the passengers were \"youth travelers\" bound for Prague, Czech Republic, after a stopover in Athens. The flight, a charter, had taken off from Larnaka in Cyprus on its way to Prague via Athens. Greek Defense Ministry officials said no chain of events could be ruled out in a crash that baffled many aviation experts, though by late afternoon terrorism was being discounted. State-run news media reported that a malfunction in the aircraft's oxygen system might have precipitated the crash and that the cabin might have rapidly lost pressure. Many of the victims found in the sheared and burning wreckage were still wearing oxygen masks. Airport officials in Larnaka said the pilot of the airliner reported problems with the air-conditioning system minutes before losing contact with Greek and Cypriot traffic controllers. Though the plane was out of radio contact with the ground for more than an hour after that, it appeared that at least some passengers remained conscious. Before the plane crashed, the Greek fighter pilots reported seeing two people trying to take the controls in the cockpit. \"The pilots have turned blue. Farewell cousin -- we're frozen,\" one passenger wrote in a text message from a cell phone, according to an interview with a relative on Greece's Alpha television. Bereaved and angry relatives flooded the airport in Larnaka, some collapsing in grief, as senior Greek ministers, including the country's prime minister, Kostas Karamanlis, broke off from their vacations to attend crisis talks in Athens. Teams of rescue workers, firefighters and ambulances, meanwhile, scrambled to the wooded crash site as authorities evacuated a nearby monastery threatened by a brush fire started by the crash. \"I ran to help, but on arrival I found dead bodies, human parts and clothing scattered everywhere,\" one witness at the site of the crash said, according to television reports. Live television broadcasts from the disaster area showed firefighting aircraft dousing the wreckage site with water as rescue workers and volunteers combed the region, collecting corpses. Dense black smoke billowed from several small fires. One witness told Reuters that the plane's tail was cut off and that the remaining parts of the plane rolled down a hillside about 500 yards away from the tail. Aviation experts were baffled, saying it was rare for a plane to crash because of depressurization. \"Although there are precedents for both pilots losing consciousness at the controls of the aircraft in the past, for it to happen on a large airliner like a Boeing 737, with all the backup systems they have there, does seem to be really quite extraordinary,\" said Kieran Daly, editor of Air Transport Intelligence, a news agency that covers the industry. \"It really is all very peculiar,\" he added. \"I rather suspect we're heading for a very complicated investigation.\" Late on Sunday, rescue teams said they had located one of the plane's \"black boxes,\" two orange-colored devices that record flight data and voices of the pilots. In December 2004, three passengers were hospitalized after a Helios plane lost cabin pressure and made an emergency landing at the Larnaka airport. A year earlier, another Helios plane suffered engine problems, diverting to the Greek holiday island of Rhodes. Airliners are pressurized by a system that draws air from the engines, which compress air for internal use. A valve at the back of the plane determines how fast air is let out of the fuselage. Aviation experts say that depressurization is rare, and that when it occurs, a warning horn sounds in the cockpit, and crew members are supposed to put on oxygen masks and descend to 10,000 feet, where there is enough oxygen for humans to function even in a depressurized aircraft. (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) In October 1999, a Learjet carrying the golfer Payne Stewart and four other people crashed in South Dakota after flying hundreds of miles on autopilot. Fighter planes observed the cockpit windows iced over, a sign of depressurization. After the investigation of that crash, a doctor with the National Transportation Safety Board said pilots' cognitive ability could fade away quickly when oxygen was limited, often faster than they realized. Another source of incapacitation can be smoke or fumes in the cockpit. If the problem is not obvious from the wreckage, it may be discerned from tests on the blood of the victims, which will show what they were breathing before they died. The cockpit voice recorder is likely to capture the sound of the warning horn, if it sounded, and conversation between the pilots about the problem. The plane that crashed Sunday was built in 1998, a year before the airline was established. Planes of that vintage commonly carry autopilots capable of climbing to a pre-assigned altitude, and even following a predetermined course from point to point, without pilot intervention, once the course has been entered. Company officials denied reports news reports out of Cyprus that the plane had been withdrawn last year for technical problems. Flight 522 left the Larnaka airport at 9 a.m. carrying 115 passengers and six crew members. After the plane lost contact with air traffic controllers \"for more than an hour,\" said Ioannis Pantazaratos, head of the air traffic control tower at Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport, \"we had no idea who was flying the plane.\" Defense Ministry officials said two F-16 fighter jets were ordered to an urgent reconnaissance flight at 10:55 a.m. By 11:20 a.m., said the Greek air force spokesman, Yiannis Papageorgiou, \"the fighter pilots had visual contact of the aircraft.\" The two Greek jet fighters that shadowed the passenger plane spotted the co-pilot slouched over the controls. He was wearing an oxygen mask, apparently unconscious, Greece's government spokesman, Theodore Roussopoulos, said after a marathon crisis meeting led by the Greek prime minister. From then on, Papageorgiou said, \"The two fighter jets escorted the passenger plane, watching it crash into the mountain at 12:03.\" By Sunday afternoon, senior Greek and Cypriot officials began minimizing the likelihood of terrorism. \"The first indications,\" said Marios Karoyian, a spokesman for the Cyprus president, Tassos Papadopoulos, \"are that it was not caused by a terrorist act.\" In Athens, a senior Defense Ministry official said: \"We're not ruling out anything. But that the plane was not shot down by armed F-16 jet fighters suggests that this may not have been a terrorist attack.\" Helios, Cyprus' first private carrier, was established in 1999. It flies to Dublin, Ireland; Sofia, Bulgaria; Warsaw, Poland; Prague; Strasbourg, France; and several British airports. "

			"text":" A Cypriot Boeing 737 operated by a private jetliner Helios Airways crashed Sunday north of Athens, with 115 passengers including 48 children and six crew members on board, Greek news media reported. Greek Defense Ministry and fire department said that the plane crashed to a mountain at about 12:20 p.m. (0920 GMT) near the coastal town of Grammatikos, about 40 kilometers north of Athens, just a few minutes before its scheduled landing time on a flight from Larnaca International Airport of Cyprus to Prague via Athens. Police and firefighters at the crash site reportedly said there were no immediate signs of survivors. Among the passengers on the flight were 48 children, said a spokesman for Helios Airways quoted by Athens News Agency. Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis cut short a long holiday weekend and called an emergency mini-cabinet meeting. He called Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos by telephone and expressed his condolences. Reports said that crew notified Cypriot authorities of a fault in the aircraft's air conditioning unit on approaching Greek airspace, but made no contact with Greek air traffic controllers on entry. Greek civil aviation authorities alerted the air force in line with anti-terrorism measures. Two F-16 fighter jets sent from a military base in Crete located the aircraft a few minutes later in the southern Aegean, but calls for identification went unheeded and the plane appeared to be out of control, reports said. Flying at close quarters, air force officers reported that the aircraft's co-pilot appeared to have collapsed over his controls but no captain was visible through the cockpit window. Overhead oxygen masks in the cabin section had dropped into place. After reporting the aircraft as \"renegade\", or unidentified, the pilots tracked the airliner at about 38,000 feet until it began to lose height and crashed sparking a blaze. Firefighters and rescue workers sped to the wreckage as military helicopters patrolled overhead. Through scenes aired by Greek television stations, plane wreckage was scattered widely about the mountain. \"The most likely thing is that a technical fault was involved, but we are looking into all possible causes and details. It would not be responsible to say anything yet about the cause of the descent,\" said Greek Government Spokesman Theodoros Roussopoulos. Reports also disclosed that passengers aboard the flight had sent text messages to relatives complaining of an \"Artic chill\" in the cabin with people starting to turn blue from the cold. However, Greek media and Cypriot President's spokesman Marios Karogian said that terrorism had been ruled out in the incident on the basis of collected information. "

			"text":" Angry relatives swarmed the counters at Larnaca airport, hurling curses at the managers of an airline whose plane crashed in Greece earlier Sunday, killing all passengers and crew on board. Shouting \"murderers,\" and \"You deserve lynching,\" the crowd demanded to know whether their relatives were actually on board the Helios Airways flight ZU522 that left Larnaca for Athens International Airport when it crashed at about 12:20 p.m. (0920GMT) near Grammatiko, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of the Greek capital. The Boeing 737-300 was due to fly onto Prague, Czech Republic, after stopping in Athens. Greek fire chief Christos Smetis said there were no survivors among the 115 passengers and six crew on board the plane. \"The fire is still burning and there are no survivors.\" Fueling the relatives' anger were reports that the plane may have crashed due to a technical fault that had affected Helios planes in the past. Officials were also citing decompression in the cabin and cockpit as a possible cause, and said the plane's two black boxes had been located. Sotiris Voutas, a cousin of one of the passengers on the plane, told Greece's Alpha television that he received a text message from the cousin on his mobile phone minutes before the crash. \"He told me the pilots were unconscious ... he said: \"Farewell, cousin, here we're frozen.\" Voutas said his cousin also told him he went to the cockpit to check what was wrong and saw the pilot \"all blackened.\" Cyprus' radio and television stations cancelled their daily programs to relay uninterrupted coverage on the crash as people telephoned to seek news or speculate over what might have caused the crash. Suspicions of a technical fault as the cause of the crash grew through the day as several of the callers said that they had experienced severe air conditioning problems when flying similar Helios jets in recent months. Some said the cabin was freezing and the crew had to provide them with blankets while others said it became unbearably hot. Greek state television quoted Cyprus Transport Minister Haris Thrasou as saying the plane had problems with decompression in the past. "

			"text":" The Cypriot airliner that crashed Sunday in Greece, killing all 121 people on board, may have experienced a catastrophic loss of cabin pressure that rapidly starved the pilots of oxygen, aviation experts said. The co-pilot of the Helios Airways flight from Larnaca, Cyprus, was slumped over the controls and the captain was not in the cockpit, the Greek air force said after sending two F-16 jets to intercept the airliner after it failed to respond to radio calls. Oxygen masks were seen hanging in the cabin, a Greek government spokesman said. \"If the aircraft lost cabin pressure, either in the cockpit or the cabin, effectively everybody would be doomed within a short space of time,\" said Chris Yates, an aviation analyst at Jane's Transport. \"If the aircraft went into depressurization very quickly you only have a few seconds before you lose consciousness because you don't have any air to breathe at that altitude,\" Yates said. Airplane cabins are pressurized so that the air remains breathable even at very high altitudes. If a plane suffers a loss of air pressure, the crew typically has enough warning to try to get to a lower altitude. \"It is one of these things that can be serious ... but if it occurs, there should be an automatic deployment of oxygen masks,\" said David Kaminski Morrow, deputy news editor of the British-based magazine Air Transport Intelligence. \"The crew get oxygen, passengers will be on oxygen and there is enough in the tanks to get the aircraft to an altitude where you don't need the oxygen masks anymore,\" he added. The crew would attempt to bring the plane down to an altitude of about 10,000 feet (3,050 meters), where the air is breathable. This would typically be done over the sea rather than a mountainous area, Kaminski Morrow said. A spokesman for the Greek air force said the F-16s intercepted the plane at an altitude of 10,360 meters (34,000 feet). Eric Moody, a former pilot, told Sky television that the crew's failure to bring the plane down in altitude suggested they were overwhelmed by the situation, hinting at a major problem with the oxygen system. \"If the aircraft is at 30,000 feet (9,150 meters), you don't stay conscious for long, maybe 15 to 30 seconds. It is like standing on top of Mount Everest,\" Kaminski Morrow said. Gerard Feldzer, the head of France's Air and Space Museum, said many questions remained unanswered. \"An explosive depressurization with damage. ... There are procedures for rapid descent. Did the pilots not have the time to equip themselves?\" Feldzer, a former Air France pilot, said on France-Info radio. \"Was there a general poisoning (of some kind)? That seems rather improbable because a passenger sent a text message\" to a relative after the pilots apparently lost consciousness, he said. Even if the pilots somehow had become incapacitated by a drop in pressure, there would be no reason for the plane to crash straight away, the experts said. \"The pressurizing system is totally independent from the flying controls,\" Moody told Sky. \"If it was on automatic pilot at the time, as it probably would have been, there's no reason why it would have crashed immediately due to lack of pressure.\" In a case with possible parallels, a lack of oxygen apparently caused the 1999 crash that killed golfer Payne Stewart and four others aboard Stewart's twin-engined jet. The plane went down in a pasture in South Dakota after flying halfway across the United States on autopilot, as the five apparently became unconscious after the plane lost cabin pressure. Experts were puzzled by reports that passengers may have remained conscious longer than the pilots. One passenger reportedly sent a text message before the crash to say that the pilots were unconscious and \"we are all frozen.\" Greek government spokesman Theodoros Roussopoulos said that when the F-16 pilots flew by the Helios Airways plane a second time, they saw two people apparently trying to take control of the Boeing 737. It was unclear whether they were passengers or pilots. \"The cabin pressure and the cockpit pressure are the same,\" said Yates, noting that a failure should affect both equally. \"It's possible some of the passengers on board, because of their age, because of their health or whatever, may have been able to last a bit longer,\" he said.

			"text":" The Greek government on Sunday ruled out the possibility of a terror attack after a Cypriot Boeing 737 operated by the private Helios Airways crashed Sunday north of Athens, killing all 115 passengers and six crew members on board. PLANE CRASHES AFTER LOSING CONTACT The plane crashed to a mountain at about 12:20 p.m. (0920 GMT) near the coastal town of Grammatikos, about 40 km north of Athens, just a few minutes before its scheduled landing time on a flight from Larnaca International Airport of Cyprus to Prague via Athens. Police and firefighters at the crash site reportedly said there were no immediate signs of survivors.

GREEK GOVERNMENT RULES OUT TERRORISM The Greek government said on Sunday that no evidence of terrorism or foul play had emerged after the plane crashed. Government spokesman Theodoros Roussopoulos flatly rejected media speculation that two air force fighter jets, which were sent to track the aircraft after its crew failed to communicate with Greece's air traffic control on its entry, had been ordered to shoot down the plane on fears of terrorism. \"There was no such thought,\" he told reporters after a lengthy cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis, who cut short his long weekend holiday and returned to Athens. Meanwhile, Cypriot officials said there is no evidence of terrorism so far. \"The first indications, in Cyprus and in Greece, are that it was not caused by a terrorist act,\" said Marios Karoyian, a spokesman for Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos in Nicosia. GREEK GOVERNMENT, EU OFFER CONDOLENCES Greek Prime Minister Karamanlis cut short a long holiday weekend and called an emergency mini-cabinet meeting. He called Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos by telephone and expressed his condolences. European Union (EU) Transport Commissioner Jacques Barrot also expressed his condolences to victims of the crash. \"It is with great sadness that I have learned of today's airliner crash near Athens, which has cost the lives of all on board.

MYSTERY REMAINS OVER DOOMED PLANE Though official sources suspected that an apparently technical problem could have caused the tragedy, accident investigators still faced a mystery over the last minutes of the doomed plane. The crash, the worst air disaster in Greece and the worst involving a Cypriot airline, perplexed aviation experts astounded by what appeared to have been a catastrophic failure of cabin pressure or oxygen supply at 10 km up. Experts were also looking into what might have happened in the last minutes of the plane which was declared \"renegade\" when it entered Greek air space and failed to make radio contact, causing two F-16 air force jets planes to scramble to investigate. Greek government spokesman Roussopoulos said the pilots sent to investigate reported that with the pilots out of action there may have been a last-gasp effort by two others on the plane to bring the craft back under control. The pilots also saw oxygen masks down when they got close to the aircraft. The plane was making continuous right-hand turns to show it had lost radio contact, he said. Reports also disclosed that passengers aboard the flight had sent text messages to relatives complaining of an \"Arctic chill\" in the cabin with people starting to turn blue from the cold. A senior official at the Public Order Ministry speculated that a sudden drop in cabin pressure could have caused the disaster. He said the pilot had mentioned a problem with the plane's air-conditioning system before losing contact. But other experts said a sudden loss of pressurization would not have caused an airplane to crash, nor would it have made the pilots immediately unconscious, as the pilots would have had their own oxygen supply. Roussopoulos said the black box of the plane had been found and investigation of the cause had been under way. US investigators were on their way to Athens as US law requires them to help with the investigation whenever a US-made aircraft is involved. "

Constantinos Michas, a resident of Grammatiko near the ancient city of Marathon, was one of the first people on the scene Sunday. \"I took my car and went straight to the mountain ... I saw about 80 dead bodies, some were children,\" he said. \"There were some body parts but most were just as their mother made them.\" Only three parts of the plane remained intact _ the tail, the cockpit, and a large chunk of the fuselage. The tail, emblazoned with an ancient Greek symbol of the sun, ended up on a dirt road. The plane _ carrying 121 people, more than a third of them children _ broke up into at least three pieces. Bodies, luggage and parts of the plane were scattered over 12 acres (5 hectares) of hillside. There were no survivors. As police cordoned off part of the crash sites with bright orange tape, firefighting planes and helicopters swooped overhead to battle a brush fire started by the crash, which rekindled at the site throughout the day. One eyewitness described the instant the Boeing 737 smashed into the mountain flanked by two F-16 fighter jets sent to intercept the passenger plane after it failed to respond to radio signals. \"We saw some fighter jets flying very low and after a few minutes we heard a very loud noise and saw pieces of the plane flying in the air,\" said Spyros Papachristou. The pilots of the F-16s said they saw the jet's co-pilot slumped over the controls and the pilot was not in the cockpit. Bits of human flesh, clothing, and luggage were scattered around the wreckage, which started brush fires around the area. \"There is wreckage everywhere,\" Grammatiko Mayor George Papageorgiou said. \"Things here are very difficult, they are indescribable.\" As dusk fell, rescue vehicles began ferrying the remains, wrapped in green body bags, out of the valley and to a fleet of 17 ambulances, which were relaying the bodies to a morgue in the Athens suburb of Shisto. The crash occurred on the eve of a main religious holiday in Greece and Cyprus _ a public holiday devoted to the Virgin Mary. A number of black-robed Greek Orthodox Christian priests were on the scene. Crash scene investigators wearing surgical masks said most bodies appeared to be intact with some badly burnt. In Cyprus, President Tassos Papadopoulos declared three days of official mourning. In Greece, Prime Minister Costas Caramanlis returned to Athens from a holiday on the Aegean island of Tinos. Greece's main opposition leader George Papandreou visited the scene. \"This is extremely difficult work, collecting bodies and putting out these fires. It appears it was mechanical damage but it's too early to say,\" he said. "
