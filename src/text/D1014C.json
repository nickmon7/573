			"text":" KUWAIT CITY, November 2 (Xinhua) -- More than 40 percent of Kuwaiti women are obese and suffer from other chronic ailments such as vein-hardening, diabetes and hypertension, local press reported today, citing a Kuwaiti psychologist. Mohammed Al-Mousawi, Director of the Educational Research Center in Kuwait, called on the people to follow a scientific diet to reduce opportunities of contracting the diseases, English daily Arab Times said.. The expert said Friday that a sedentary life style was the primary cause of such diseases. He warned that obesity would directly lead to depression which is also a common disease in Kuwait. Kuwaiti women accounted for 50.4 percent of the country's population, which is 708,000. People in Kuwait are usually kept away from outdoor physical exercises by the hot desert climate which lasts at least for eight months a year, and diet with much fat are their favorates. Al-Mousawi said: \"I therefore advise women suffering from such diseases to take some exercises such as walking and to follow the right diet.\" He also cited links between psychological problems such as fear and anxiety with obesity, adding that psychological pressure could drive some people into ingesting large quantities of food that lead to obesity.

			"text":" GENEVA, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The number of diabetics worldwide will increase from the current about 120 million to top 250 million by the year 2025, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported today. The growth will be registered in both developed and, especially, developing countries, due to population aging, unhealthy diets, obesity and a secondary lifestyle. According to the U.N. health agency, about 20 percent of diabetics develop the so-called insulin-dependent form of diabetes, or IDDM, and live on with insulin injections, while about 30 percent of the non-IDDM cases may use insulin injections to control their conditions. The WHO considers insulin an essential drug. However, it noted that in some developing countries, the drug that turns the once fatal IDDM into a treatable disease is still unavailable or unaffordable. A vial of insulin may cost a month's salary in many African countries, according to it. Diabetes is a chronic disease caused by the human body's failure to produce insulin or to produce effective insulin. The deficiency leads to increased concentrations of glucose in blood and thus damage the body's many systems, particularly blood vessels and nerves. The long-term complications of diabetes include blindness, kidney failure, heart attacks and even gangrene and amputation of the limbs. Insulin was discovered in 1921. "

			"headline":"Over Half of Kuwaitis Obese: Study",
			"text":" KUWAIT CITY, January 23 (Xinhua) -- More than half of the 710,000 Kuwaiti citizens are suffering from obesity and anemia because of poor eating habits and other causes, according to studies by a leading local nutritionist. Obesity is number one health threat associated with nutrition in Kuwait, Director of Food and Nutrition Department of the Ministry of health Fawzia Al-Awadi said in a recent study. According to his study, 42 percent of Kuwaiti women and 28 percent of men are obese. Twenty-eight percent of Kuwaiti men are overweight. The ratio of female to male in Kuwaiti population is 51:49. Several factors contribute to the higher prevalence of obesity in adult women, Al-Awadi said. These factors include repeated pregnancies, rapid decline in breast feeding, an early introduction to bottle feeding as well as poor eating habits. She revealed that police and army personnel were more susceptible to becoming overweight (34.4 percent) while obesity was most prevalent among males with a technical profession. \"Regular food consumption between meals, the use of sugar in tea, and the consumption of an additional meal at Diwaniya (men's leisure time in chatting gathering) contributed significantly to the development of obesity among this group,\" she explained. Al-Awadi's another survey conducted among 1,154 obese patients revealed that nearly one quarter of them had hypertension and about 33 percent suffered diabetes. Al-Awadi noted that \"it has been shown that obesity shortens life which is mainly due to cardiovascular and cerebro-vascular diseases, constituting an additional risk to overweight patients.\" The nutritionist also said a large percentage of Kuwaiti children are suffering from malnutrition due to bad feeding habits that cause iron deficiency anemia. She said the intake of vitamin C rich foods such as fruit juices are very low, particularly among pre-school children. Factors affecting the eating habits in Kuwait are income, food prices, food import policies and the drastic change in food formula, she reiterated. Increase in family income causes a change in the dietary patterns that mainly are represented by an increase in consumption of soft drinks, tea, chocolates, sweets, nuts and ready-made foods. "

			"text":" HONG KONG, February 17 (Xinhua) -- A survey showed that Hong Kong children were eating too much junk food, local press reports revealed today. The poll of 2,760 students' eating habits by the Chai Wan Caritas Children and Youth Center found crisps, sweets, chocolates, chips, chicken and other deep-fried food, ice-cream and ice-lollies topped the list of favorite foods. More than half the respondents spent up to five HK dollars (0.64 US dollars) a day on junk food, and another 26 percent spent between six to ten HK dollars (0.77 to 1.28 US dollars). Most of the snacks were bought from their school tuck shops, the survey showed. Over 12 percent said they did not eat breakfast, and close to 30 percent were unsatisfied with their weight. Head of the center, William Ng Man-sui, said concern over an increasing number of young children with obesity problems had prompted him to research the eating habits of upper-grade students at all seven primary schools in Chai Wan, a district in the east of Hong Kong island. He urged schools to educate students about nutrition and a balanced diet. "

			"text":" SHANGHAI, July 15 (Xinhua) -- One out of every ten people in Shanghai is overweight, mostly because of improved lifestyles and poor eating habits. A recent survey found that 12.6 percent of 4,895 adults and 11.35 percent of 9,093 children who live in urban Shanghai are obese, and these figures are close to the average weight proportion seen in developed countries, it was reported in today's \"Wen Hui Bao Daily.\" The survey was conducted jointly by the Xiangshan Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine and the Nutrition and Food Research Section of the Shanghai Medical Science University. People in the 7-12 and 60-70 age groups run a greater risk of becoming overweight, and incidence of obesity in males is higher than in females, the survey showed. Educational background was also related to the incidence rate, which is lower in well-educated people, especially in females. About 70 million Chinese people, mostly city dwellers, are obese, and the number is on the rise as people's living standards have greatly improved in recent years. Many of them gained unwanted pounds because they do not engage in regular exercise, sleep too much and eat food that is high in fat and calories, another survey of Beijing's overweight people showed. Experts warn people who are overweight have increased tendencies toward cardiovascular and cerebral disease, diabetes, and kidney and liver disease. "

			"text":" ABU DHABI, July 23 (Xinhua) -- A massive increase in the incidence of diabetes has been forecast for the United Arab Emirates (UAE) nationals unless education and preventive measures are taken, a medical study said. About 11 percent of national men and 14 percent of women had diabetes and the rate is expected to rise in the following years, according to the study released by UAE's medical center today. The study, involving 2,000 UAE nationals aged between 30 and 80 years, found diabetes in the UAE to be particularly widespread among the elderly and less educated social groups. The study attributed the reason to the increasing incidence of obesity among UAE nationals, which is strongly linked to diabetes. Doctors said common sense should be applied and they suggested nationals to eat more fruits, cereals and vegetables which were cited as the best sources to avoid diabetes. The UAE has a 2.4 million population, but about two third of them are foreigners. "

			"text":" LONDON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Heavy-drinking women, school children who smoke and the overweight of both sexes are ruining Britain's drive to create a healthy nation. Only 11 of the 27 targets set by the Department of Health to reduce premature death and avoidable sickness by promoting sensible lifestyles look certain to be reached, according to an official report. The National Audit Office today reported limited progress in achieving the aims of the Health of the Nation White Paper of l992. The ambitious strategy to reduce coronary heart disease, strokes, cancer, mental illness, sexually transmitted diseases and accidents was introduced by Virginia Bottomley when she was health secretary. Teams from the National Health Service formulated \"action plans\" to improve education, screening and preventive techniques. Healthy targets were set to be reached by dates between 1994 and 2005. But despite the implementation of the strategy, John Bourn, the comptroller and auditor general, reported that Britons' behavior is becoming worse in three areas: obesity in men and women, drinking by women and smoking by the young. The British government set targets on obesity because it increases the likelihood of coronary heart disease, strokes and illnesses including diabetes. The government wants only 8 percent of women and 6 percent of men, aged 16 to 64, to be overweight by 2005: the same proportion as in 1980. But instead figures since then have risen to 16 percent of women and 13 percent of men. Alcohol targets were set because too much drink raises the blood pressure, increasing the risk of stroke, and is blamed for liver cirrhosis, cancers and road traffic accidents. However, the Health Department is refusing to consider a ban on cigarette and alcohol advertising, saying it is up to the public to change lifestyles, following government health education. "

			"text":" BEIJING, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Armed with new surveys showing high rates of childhood anemia, obesity, and short stature, nutritionists in Guangzhou are pushing for more attention to local children's diets both at home and school. According to a recent city survey, more than 40 percent of the teenagers suffer from anemia caused by malnutrition and about 20 percent of middle school students are overweight, \"China Daily\" reports today. The survey says that Guangzhou teenagers, shorter than the average national height of the same age group, are about 10 to 15 centimeters shorter than Japanese teens. Zhong Yukun, a nutrition expert of the Guangzhou Science and Technology Association, blamed unbalanced and dull food eaten every day for the malnutrition-based health problems. Rice, the main Cantonese food, contains much less nutrition than that found in corn, wheat, potatoes and many other staples popular in north China. In Guangzhou, about 70 percent of the teenagers either have the school lunch or buy lunch on the street nearby. And most school cafeterias don't serve food containing the seven basic nutrients students need every day, according to Zhong. Many spoiled teenagers from one-child families eat only a particular kind of food, such as meat or sweets, which might easily lead them to develop obesity, diabetes or heart disease. "

			"text":" SHANGHAI, September 10 (Xinhua) -- A survey in Shanghai has revealed that one in eight people in the city suffer from overweight. The study shows that the 12 percent obesity is close to the standard in developed countries. The survey was carried out among nearly 14,000 people, including 4,895 adults and over 9,093 young people from nine districts in the city. It was conducted by Shanghai Medical Sciences University and Shanghai Xiangshan Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital. The research showed that the ratio of adults suffering from obesity has reached 12.6 percent, and that of youngsters is 11.35 percent. The survey indicated that differences in age, gender, and education levels can influence the ratio of obesity. Fifteen percent of female adults suffer from obesity, while the level among male adults 10.68 percent. However, more boys suffer from obesity than girls. The ratio of boys is 14.7 percent, almost double that of girls. Researchers found that children aged from seven to 12, and people between aged 60 and 70, are easiest to fall victim to obesity. They also found that the higher education levels people have, the less they are likely to suffer from obesity, especially among women. Medical experts suggested that citizens, especially people suffering from obesity, should follow advice to change their life styles and diets. "
