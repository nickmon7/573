			"text":" KUNMING, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Yunnan Province has launched a project to strengthen environmental protection, and will pour more investment into the sector. Yunnan plans to achieve widespread improvement in its environment by the first decade of the next century, with forest coverage rate hitting 30 percent, and the area of natural reserve zones accounting for eight percent of the province's total land. Efforts will be focused on 100 severely polluting sources, and provincial officials will close 15 kinds of small enterprises. By the year 2000, the volume of waste discharged by Yunnan will be reduced to the national standard. Yunnan also has decided to strengthen environmental protection of its lake areas, which are the main residential areas there, by working out many restrictions for the use of lake resources. It has already succeeded in improving the water quality of the Dianchi Lake and Nanpanjiang River. Regional ecological protection programs have also been launched to reduce the deterioration of the ecological environment. The province has limited the number of trees to be chopped down in the forest area in northwest Yunnan and has stopped building sugar factories in the Xishuangbanna region to preserve the only tropical rain forest in the country located there.

			"text":" KUNMING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- China's largest tropical rain forest, in the Xishuangbanna nature reserve in Yunnan Province, will get further protection when the reserve is enlarged from 247,000 ha to 533,000 ha, according to Zhuang Yan, head of the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture. Zhuang says that they are removing itinerant farmers from the rain forest and helping them settle elsewhere. Han Xingguo, of the Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden, says that the Himalayas acts as a natural protective screen, stopping cold air from the north, while warm, moist air from the Indian Ocean brings plentiful rain. This allows the tropical rain forest to harbor many rare and valuable flora and fauna that are on the verge of extinction elsewhere, Han says, but because it's between a torrid zone and a subtropical zone, it is more fragile than those at the equator. Xishuangbanna has at least 58 species of rare or endangered plants, 15 percent of China's total number, and it is home to 102 species of mammals and 427 species of birds, a quarter and a third of China's total, respectively. Protecting the area means protecting an important gene storehouse, Han says. The first nature reserve was established on 57,000 ha of land in Xishuangbanna as early as in 1959, and after nearly four decades it has grown to 247,000 ha with most of the rain forest. The Academy of Sciences has observation posts in the forest to study the bio-diversity and scientists have moved 3,000 rare plants to a special 90-ha area for protection. "

			"headline":"Experts Call for Protecting Gibbons",
			"text":" HAIKOU, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Experts from across China today called for urgent action to protect the dwindling number of black gibbons in southern China's Hainan province. A total of 150 experts and professors from 25 research institutes and colleges across the country have launched the nationwide appeal. They called on government departments to participate in and mobilize social forces to enhance the construction and management of a natural protection zone on Bawangling Mountain, where black gibbons live. Located in the western part of Hainan province, Bawangling Mountain boasts more than 1,000 varieties of wild animals, with over 40 kinds belonging to rare animals. In the 1950s, there were 2,000 black gibbons living in the forest area of the province's 10 counties. Living space for gibbons fell dramatically with increasing human population, deterioration of forest environments, and excessive cutting of tropical rain forests. Now there are only 15 to 20 gibbons remaining in the mountain area. Gibbons are regarded as an animal indicator in the tropical rain forest. They have the same skeletal structure as humans -- four limbs, facial features, internal organs, and similar blood as human beings; and they are physiologically, psychologically and mentally similar to human beings. Gibbons are of high research value, regarded by many as precious as giant pandas in China, according to experts. Many international and foreign organizations have paid close attention to the protection of gibbons. They sent teams to conduct on-the-spot studies, established research centers, provide funds and publish information to generate world wide attention to their plight. Hainan provincial government department has vowed to set up a foundation for the protection of gibbons, and to prevent and crack down on activities which threaten the life of gibbons. "

			"text":" HAIKOU, June 22 (Xinhua) -- A tropical rain forest project is to start soon in south China's Hainan province. Under the program tropical rain-forest trees will be planted, along with tropical fruit trees and economic trees. Related agricultural and sideline product processing zones will also be established in the area of 5,400 hectares in Jianfeng Mountain area, Ledong county in southern parts of Hainan province. The project will cost 35 million US dollars, with 18 million coming from Asian Development Bank loans. Cui Xiaosu, an official in charge of the implementation of the project, said that the theme of the project will focus on environmental protection and help the poor in the project area. Meanwhile Cui is also confident about the economic returns of the project, since the area boasts rich land resources and favorable soil and climate conditions for the growing of tropical rain trees. The project area now has 12,000 people, mainly of the Li nationality. Implementation of the project will stimulate local economic development, expand employment and improve farming skills of local people. More than 30,000 people are expected to benefit from the project. Jianfeng Mountain tropical rain forest, covering more than 44,600 hectares, is now the largest in China. The forest is of great importance to the environmental and ecological protection in Hainan province and even Southeast Asia. There are also many endangered and unique plants in the area. Chinese government has always attached great importance to the protection of this area. It first set up a tropical primary forest protection zone in the area in 1951. A national forest garden was established there in 1992, and in 1993, Hainan provincial government decided to stop commercial tree felling in the area. "

Juma made the appeal while opening a five-day international workshop on composite materials and waste minimization here on Monday. He said that there is great hope in new technologies to turn agricultural residues and wastes into useful construction materials and therefore reduce dependence on wood products. The vice-president noted that deforestation and land degradation are taking place at a great pace in the country, cautioning that unless drastic measures were taken, Tanzania and many other African countries would soon experience desertification. He said that the indiscriminate use of forests is largely caused by poverty, \"symbolized by such negative practices as rampant felling of trees for firewood and bad farming practices.\" The dwindling rain forest reserves and rapid expansion of the Sahara desert southwards pose a threat to the survival of the people in the African countries, Juma warned. The workshop is being attended by experts from 14 countries in Africa and Europe. "

			"text":" RIO DE JANEIRO, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Brazil and Malaysia are to jointly launch a series of remote sensing satellites (RSS) from 1998 to monitor tropical forests. The launching of the RSSs, the first of this kind of satellite on a permanent orbit 900 kilometers above the equator, is estimated to cost 37 millon U.S. dollars. The RSSs will monitor 2,200 square kilometers of the Amazon rain forest, which it will pass over every 105 minutes, said Brazil's National Institute of Space Research. Satellites currently monitoring the region cannot see clearly through the thick clouds which cover the region for several months annually, but the RSSs can do that. Brazil, which is in charge of the design of the RSS, plans to build a land-monitoring base in the Cuiaba city, located in Amazon's Pantanal wetlands. Malaysia, also endowed with rich tropical rain forest, will build bases on its territory to pick up and analyse data from the satellites. Director of the Brazilian institute, Marcio Nogueira Barbosa, recently visited Malaysia to negotiate the joint launching of the RSSs, a project which is estimated to last eight years. "
