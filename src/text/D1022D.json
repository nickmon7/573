			"text":" Australia strongly opposes Japanese plans to expand its whaling catch in Antarctic waters but will not try to board Japanese whaling ships there because it could be accused of piracy, Attorney General Philip Ruddock said Saturday. Ruddock said Australia was \"vigorously opposed\" to the Japanese proposals and would press its efforts to establish a South Pacific whale sanctuary. But the government opposes an application in Australia's Federal Court to prevent a Japanese whaling company entering the Australian-declared whale sanctuary in Antarctica, which Japan does not recognise. Ruddock told Sky News that Australian patrol boats could be accused of piracy if they boarded Japanese ships in the area, because of Australia's obligations under the Antarctic Treaty. \"To put Australian forces at risk in relation to an area where some people would say you have no claims -- even though we assert them -- could lead to very significant issues in relation to whether what we'd be doing constituted piracy,\" he told Sky News. Japan says it will seek approval to expand its catch at the annual meeting of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) opening on May 30 in South Korea. Japanese media reports have said it will seek nearly to double its annual catch of Minke whales, currently set at 440, in the Antarctic and to catch the larger humpback and fin whales which are considered endangered by the World Conservation Union. Japan, where whale meat is part of culinary culture, reluctantly halted commercial whaling in line with a 1986 IWC moratorium. The next year it resumed catches under a loophole that allows \"research whaling,\" despite international protests. \"We are vigorously opposed to what they are seeking to do... and we're continuing to be at the forefront of the campaign to have a South Pacific whale sanctuary and that is the effort we will continue to make,\" Ruddock said. Any direct action would undermine diplomatic efforts, he said. Environment Minister Ian Campbell said Japan risks damaging its reputation in the eyes of most Australians if it persists with plans to hunt humpback whales. He said Canberra would press for reform of the IWC when it meets next month, in a bid to have all forms of whaling banned. Campbell said the catching of humpback whales, which migrate the west and east coasts of Australia in increasing numbers, \"is something that will potentially seriously damage the way Australians perceive Japan.\" "

			"headline":"NZ mulls over stopping Japan 's whale slaughter in World Court",
			"text":" New Zealand is seeking all options including a possible legal fight against Japan's plan to kill endangered humpback whales, local media said Monday. Conservation Minister Chris Carter told NZPA, a news agency, that he understands the Japanese want to add 80 of each of hampback and fin whales to its legal kill lists. Japan plans to go to the meeting of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) in South Korea in June asking to double its kill of about 440 minke whales a year for so-called scientific purposes, and also add humpback and fin whales to the list. Carter, who is to attend the IWC meeting, said New Zealand is fighting the proposal on a number of counts, and taking a case to the World Court is one option. Green Party co-leader Jeanette Fitzsimons said only words are not enough to stop Japan's plans for the slaughter and the New Zealand \"Government must take serious action against Japan.\" Challenging the plans in the World Court should be considered, said Fitzsimons. \"The humpback whale was almost hunted into extinction. We cannot allow it to become a target for Japanese harpoon guns,\" she said. "

			"headline":"NZ Greens considering consumer boycott over Japan's plans for expanded whale hunt",
			"text":" Green Party lawmakers in Australia and New Zealand are considering urging consumers to boycott Japanese products to protest Tokyo's plan to expand its annual whale hunt, the party's co-leader said Monday. Jeanette Fitzsimons told New Zealand's National Radio she had discussed with Australian Green Party leader Bob Brown the idea of \"some trans-Tasman consumer action against Japan if they succeed\" in getting approval from the International Whaling Commission for an expanded whale hunt. \"I think the time has come to look at diplomatic measures, trade measures, to look at things consumers can do,\" she said. \"We've actually got to show some muscle here,\" she added. The Tasman Sea separates Australia and New Zealand, two nations strongly opposed to Japan's continuing hunting of whales under a research program. Japan announced in early April it intends to seek permission to conduct a \"broader and more comprehensive\" research whaling program in the Antarctic at the commission's annual meeting in South Korea in mid-June. Tokyo has declined to release details of the expanded hunt ahead of the IWC Scientific Committee's consideration of the proposal in the three weeks prior to the IWC's full meeting. Opponents of the plan have claimed that Japan is seeking to double to 800 the number of minke whales it will slaughter each year, and to add 50 humpback whales and 50 fin whales. Japan has not previously killed humpbacks or fin whales as part of its research program, which began in 1987. Tokyo has repeatedly failed to muster the three-fourths majority of IWC member nations needed to overturn the commercial whaling ban which took effect in 1986. It has recently threatened to quit the commission. Fitzsimons dismissed Japan's scientific whaling as a cover for continuing \"to put whale meat on the table in Japan.\" New Zealand Conservation Minister Chris Carter said he was prepared \"to explore any avenue ... if we can stop Japan slaughtering these whales.\" Taking legal action against Japan in the Hague-based World Court was one option being explored, he said. He said the mammals migrate through New Zealand waters and provide the basis for a major whale-watching industry. "

			"headline":"Japan's bid to harvest more whales is \"very bad,\" Australia's PM says",
			"text":" Australia's prime minister on Wednesday criticized a move by Japan to increase its whale harvest in the Antarctic as a \"very bad decision,\" but stood by his policy of not intercepting Japanese whaling boats. The International Whaling Commission, or IWC, banned commercial whaling in 1986, but grants limited permits to countries such as Japan that maintain whaling programs for scientific purposes. Japan announced in April it plans to seek permission to extend its research whaling program in the Antarctic when the IWC meets later this month. Australia's Prime Minister John Howard on Wednesday defended his decision not to intercept whaling boats found in Antarctic waters, saying Japan and many other countries do not recognize Australian territorial claims in Antarctica and a whaling sanctuary that is protected under Australian law. \"The Australian claim is not recognized by a lot of countries around the world,\" Howard told Southern Cross radio in the Queensland state capital, Brisbane. \"If there were any attempt by force to interfere with whaling activities otherwise sanctioned by international agreements, it would be a breach of international agreements.\" Howard said he would prefer to use diplomatic measures to encourage Japan not to kill whales in Antarctic waters, and said Australia was working with the United States, New Zealand and England to urge Tokyo to reconsider its proposal. \"There are other ways of trying to change what I regard as a very bad decision by the Japanese, a very bad decision,\" he added. Howard also criticized Japan _ which kills about 400 minke whales in Antarctic waters each year _ for reported plans to harvest humpback whales, which were severely depleted by commercial whaling in the early part of last century. \"It is not science to harvest 400 whales. It is not,\" Howard said. \"The decision to go after the humpback whales as well _ the decision cannot be justified on scientific grounds.\" Whaling opponents say Japan is using research as a pretext to continue the commercial sale of whale meat. Proceeds of about US$52 million (euro41.15 million) go back into funding the annual hunts. The 57-member IWC is scheduled to hold its annual meeting in Ulsan, South Korea, from May 27 to June 24. Japan has threatened to withdraw from the commission if it does not get approval for increased whaling. "

			"headline":"Australia vows unprecedented drive to curb Japan whale kill",
			"text":" Australia said Tuesday it was engaged in an unprecedented diplomatic campaign to disuade Japan from trying to escalate its killing of whales. Prime Minister John Howard intervened personally, writing to his Japanese counterpart Junichiro Koizumi at the weekend to urge Tokyo to reconsider its position on whaling, Environment Minister Ian Campbell said. Tokyo has applied to the International Whaling Commission (IWC) for permission to nearly double its annual catch of Minke whales, currently set at 440, and to catch the larger humpback and fin whales which are considered endangered by the World Conservation Union. Japan, where whale meat is part of culinary culture, reluctantly halted commercial whaling in line with a 1986 IWC moratorium, but the next year resumed catches under a loophole that allows \"research whaling\". Tokyo is believed to have the votes needed to get its request approved at the next IWC meeting which begins Friday in South Korea. In his letter to Koizumi, Howard challenged the Japanese claim that it needs to expand its whale kill for research purposes. \"Given that non-lethal methods exist for scientific research, Australia believes that there is no basis for killing whales,\" Howard wrote in the two-page letter, excerpts of which were published in The Daily Telegraph Tuesday and confirmed by Campbell. Howard, who recently agreed to dispatch 450 troops to guard Japanese army engineers in southern Iraq despite domestic opposition to the move and visited Tokyo last month, said relations between the two countries had never been closer, but that \"good friends should always feel free to disagree\". The IWC meeting coincides with the start of Australia's whale watching season, when hundreds of humpbacks swim up the east coast seeking warmer waters during the southern winter. Howard noted in his letter that some 1.6 million tourists flock to Australian shores to watch the whale migration each year. \"This is clear evidence of the extent of public interest in the continued health and welfare of whales and considerable public concern could be expected, not only in Australia, but across the globe, were whaling to increase,\" he said. Campbell said Howard's strongly-worded letter underscored Australia's determination to fight Japan's whaling plan. \"The sort of efforts that the prime minister has put in and the efforts I've been putting in over many months will continue over the next few weeks, and we won't stop until we achieve success,\" Campbell said on ABC radio. \"What the prime minister has demonstrated is that we are prepared to raise this at levels that it's never been raised before,\" he said. \"We're working internationally, we're working bilaterally, we're very, very keen to see firstly, no reopening of commercial whaling, and very importantly, no scientific whaling in the future,\" he said.

			"headline":"Japan vows to continue whaling despite Australian campaign by Miwa Suzuki ATTENTION - ADDS Howard, Campbell remarks ///",
			"text":" Tokyo will not yield to foreign pressure seeking to stop it from whaling, a fisheries official said Tuesday after Australia stepped up a campaign against Japan's annual hunt in the name of scientific research. Australian Prime Minister John Howard took the unusual step of intervening personally. He wrote to his counterpart Junichiro Koizumi, urging Japan to scrap reported plans to include species considered endangered among those hunted. But the Fisheries Agency, without commenting on plans to kill more whales near Australian waters, said Japan would continue the whaling which it argues is done for scientific research. \"Our position on research whaling will not change just because of foreign pressure,\" said Takanori Nagatomo, deputy director at the Far Seas Fisheries Division of the agency. \"We have been engaging in research whaling to collect scientific data so we can resume commercial whaling,\" he said, adding the agency has not been under any pressure from Koizumi's office or the foreign ministry. \"Whaling is also part of the Japanese culture,\" he said. Japan, where whale meat is part of the traditional cuisine, reluctantly accepted a 1986 moratorium on commercial whaling by the International Whaling Commission (IWC). But it resumed catches in 1987 using a loophole that allows \"research whaling\" and selling the meat on the market, a practice condemned by environmentalists as commercial whaling in disguise. Japan says lethal research is necessary for accurate data on whales' ages, eating habits and other details and to prove its view that such whale species as minkes are thriving and consuming valuable fish stock. Tokyo will reportedly tell the IWC at a meeting starting this month in South Korea that it intends to nearly double its annual catch of minke whales in the Antarctic Ocean, currently set at 440. It also aims to catch the larger humpback and fin whales which are considered endangered by the World Conservation Union, Japanese news reports said. In his letter to Koizumi, Howard challenged the Japanese claim that it needs to expand its whale kill for research purposes. \"Given that non-lethal methods exist for scientific research, Australia believes that there is no basis for killing whales,\" wrote Howard, noting that 1.6 million tourists flock to Australian shores to watch the whale migration each year.

			"headline":"Australian government foils court challenge against Japanese whaling",
			"text":" The Australian government on Friday foiled a court bid by international animal rights activists to stop a Japanese company from killing whales inside the country's Antarctic sanctuary. The Humane Society International went to a federal court in Sydney seeking permission to take legal against the whaling company Kyodo Senpaku Kaisha. The group accuses the company of unlawfully hunting more than 400 minke whales over the past four years in Australian waters near Antarctica. But federal court justice Jim Allsop dismissed the application because a government submission said legal action against the company could damage relations with Tokyo and jeopardise Australia's national interests. \"The Australian government has the view that the attempt to enforce the EPBC Act (to stop the killing of whales) may upset the diplomatic status quo ... and may be contrary to Australia's long term national interests,\" he said. Attorney-General Philip Ruddock said in the submission given to the court in January that the government had no right to enforce its law on Japan because Tokyo did not recognise Australia's claim of territorial sovereignty over the Australian Antarctic Territory. \"The submissions of the attorney-general appear to have great force,\" Allsop said in his ruling. Humane Society campaign director Michael Kennedy said he was \"bitterly disappointed\" by the ruling but said his group may appeal the decision to the full bench of the Federal Court. The opposition Labor Party assailed the government's intervention in the case, which coincides with efforts by Japan to gain permission from the International Whaling Commission (IWC) to double the number of whales it can kill each year. A statement by Labor foreign affairs spokesman Kevin Rudd said Friday's court ruling \"has confirmed the Howard governments spineless and hypocritical response to the slaughter of whales in the Australian Whale Sanctuary\". Earlier this week Prime Minister John Howard personally wrote to his Japanese counterpart, Junichiro Koizumi, urging him to scrap the plan to increase Japan's whale kill. The Japanese plan is due to go before the International Whaling Commission (IWC) when it meets in South Korea next month. Japan, where whale meat is part of the traditional cuisine, reluctantly accepted a 1986 moratorium on commercial whaling by the IWC. But it resumed catches in 1987 using a loophole that allows \"research whaling\" and selling the meat on the market, a practice condemned by environmentalists as commercial whaling in disguise. \"For the past week Labor has been calling on the government to take action against Japan in the International Court of Justice,\" Rudd said. \"This position has only been reinforced today by the decision of the Federal Court.\" "

			"text":" An animal rights group on Friday lost a bid to sue a Japanese whaling company for allegedly killing hundreds of whales inside an Australian whale sanctuary. Humane Society International was denied permission by Australia's Federal Court to sue Japanese whaling company Kyodo Senpaku for allegedly killing around 400 minke whales in Antarctic waters the Australian government has declared a whale sanctuary. Judge James Allsop based the rejection on a submission to the court by Canberra saying the government cannot legally stop the whaling company hunting in international waters protected by Australia because Japan does not recognize Australia's jurisdiction over the waters. Allsop said the submission, from Australia's Attorney-General Philip Ruddock, appeared \"to have great force\" and also expressed concerns that the proposed legal action could jeopardize \"Australia's long term national interests.\" Outside the court, HSI director Michael Kennedy told reporters he was \"bitterly disappointed\" in the decision and hoped to file an appeal later this year. He said the government had not taken strong enough steps to stop Japanese whaling companies from operating in Australian waters. Attorney-General Philip Ruddock said the judge had upheld the government's view that it was not appropriate to pursue the campaign against whaling in the Australian courts. \"The best way to resolve such matters is through bilateral representations and multilateral fora including the International Whaling Commission,\" Ruddock said in a statement. The International Whaling Commission imposed a moratorium on commercial whaling in 1986, but Japan's scientific hunt, in which hundreds of whales are killed each year, is widely regarded as a way of circumventing the moratorium. Japan has said it will push for a widening of its scientific whaling program at a meeting of the IWC that also began Friday in Ulsan, South Korea. Whaling opponents fear that pro-whaling countries like Japan and Norway may have a voting majority at the commission for the first time since the 1986 whaling ban was imposed. "

He said he would also discuss the issue with key Pacific nations ahead of an IWC vote at a meeting in Ulsan, South Korea, late next month. \"Australia is of the clear, informed view that whaling under scientific permits should be rejected: it is unnecessary, and nothing less than commercial whaling in disguise,\" Campbell said in a statement. \"We need to work together to promote conservation.\" Australia last week warned Tokyo it was embarking on an unprecedented diplomatic campaign to dissuade Japan from trying to escalate its killing of whales. Prime Minister John Howard intervened personally, writing to his Japanese counterpart Junichiro Koizumi at the weekend to urge Tokyo to reconsider its position on whaling.
