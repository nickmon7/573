            "text": "\n<P>\n   ROME _ An avalanche crashed through a small Austrian resort on\nTuesday, killing at least eight people and leaving dozens missing,\nin what officials feared could turn out to be Austria's worst snow\ndisaster in years.\n</P>\n<P>\n   Driving snow and deadly winds prevented emergency helicopters\nfrom flying into the ski village of Galtuer, near the Swiss border,\nwhere local rescue workers spent the night digging through walls of\nsnow and rubble for survivors. At least 30 people, some of them\ncritically injured, were dug out by evening, Austrian television\nsaid.\n</P>\n<P>\n   The fiercest snowstorms in 50 years set off massive avalanches\nall across the Alps in recent weeks, killing dozens of residents\nand ski vacationers in France, Switzerland, Italy and Austria. In\nSwitzerland, officials said the death toll over the weekend had\nrisen to seven. Houses, railroads and highways were buried by\navalanches. Tens of thousands of tourists were stranded in some of\nnorthern Europe's most fashionable resorts.\n</P>\n<P>\n   In Galtuer, a town of 700 year-round inhabitants and about 3,000\ntourists in Tyrol Province's Paznaun Valley, the avalanche\nthundered though the heart of town near the village church at 4:00\np.m. instantly crushing four houses.\n</P>\n<P>\n   The village, which has no hospital, had been cut off from the\noutside world by heavy snows and high winds for nearly a week.\n</P>\n<P>\n   ``We were drinking hot mulled wine, when suddenly it started''\nFranz Wenko, a hotel operator in Galtuer, told Austrian television.\n``he lights went out. It was dark. There was only dust and snow. We\ngot out of there as fast as we could.''\n</P>\n<P>\n   Maj. Thomas Schoenherr of the Austrian army, told Austrian radio\non Tuesday evening that about 55 people were feared missing in\nGaltuer. Other estimates varied. Some officials said 20 to 30\npeople were still missing. Another government spokesman said that\nonly ``a few'' were unaccounted for.\n</P>\n<P>\n   Austrian army helicopters remained grounded in the town of\nLandeck, about 20 miles from Galtuer, overnight. Schoenherr said,\n``We will meet again at 6 a.m. to assess what we can do.''\n</P>\n<P>\n   Inside the village, witnesses said the residents were digging\nfor survivors. ``Some 300 people are looking for buried people in\nthe mass of snow,'' Lufwig Walter, a ski instructor, told the\nAustrian Press Agency. Walter said that in some parts of the\nvillage, snow was 17 feet high. ``There's no let-up,'' he said,\nreferring to the rescue effort.\n</P>\n<P>\n   A doctor, who is believed to be the only one in the village,\ntold an APA reporter by telephone, ``We are working in very basic\nconditions.'' Snow fell heavily overnight, and the news agency\nreported that another 20 inches were expected by Wednesday morning.\n</P>\n<P>\n   All over Europe, the avalanches took lives and destroyed homes.\nA 35-year-old German woman was killed when a snowslide ploughed\ninto a chalet in Sportsgastein, near Salzburg, Austria.\n</P>\n<P>\n   In the ski village of Morgex, in northern Italy, a 52-year-old\nwoman was killed when her house collapsed under an avalanche before\ndaylight. Three others in the house survived, but she was killed\nwhen a steel beam pierced her chest.\n</P>\n<P>\n   In Switzerland, teams of rescue workers searching for survivors\nfound five more bodies on Tuesday, after an avalanche that crushed\nchalets near Evolene on Sunday. Four of the victims _ one a child _\nwere French tourists. The other was a 28-year-old local man. Three\npeople were still missing as of Tuesday night.\n</P>\n<P>\n   In France, blizzards hampered rescuers seeking French skiers and\nhikers missing in the Alps and the Pyrenees.\n</P>\n<P>\n   In western Austria alone, about 20,000 tourists have been unable\nto leave their hotels since last Wednesday. So much snow had fallen\nover the last week that the Austrian Motoring Association\ncomplained that its density monitors had been buried, making it\nimpossible to measure the snow fall. Swiss television reported that\nas many as 60,000 people were snowbound in the resorts of Davos and\nKlosters.\n</P>\n<P>\n   In many parts of Europe, driving snow caused trains to be\ncanceled. Highways were blocked or traffic was backed up for hours.\n</P>\n<P>\n   The recent avalanches, labeled by some newspapers as ``the white\ndeath,'' were described as the largest and most terrifying in\nrecent memory.\n</P>\n<P>\n   `'I've seen many avalanches, but not the type that come into\nyour house and blow it away,'' said Nathan Wallace, 28, from\nMammoth Lakes, Calif., whose chalet near Chamonix was destroyed by\nan avalanche on Feb. 9. `'It was more like a California\nearthquake.''\n</P>\n<P>\n   Wallace and his girlfriend, Alicia Boice, 21, were rescued two\nhours after the roof of their chalet collapsed.\n</P>\n",

He spoke to the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee at its opening hearing on whether to renew, rewrite or \nlet the law die.

Five people remained missing, the Austria Press Agency \nsaid.

A new study of 720 physicians found that, with all \nsymptoms being equal, doctors were only 60 percent as likely to \norder cardiac catheterization for women and blacks as for men and \nwhites. For black women, the doctors were only 40 percent as likely \nto order catheterization. \n\n</P>\n<P>\n\tGreenspan Warns About Minimum Wage  \n</P>\n<P>\n\tWASHINGTON (AP) -- Raising the minimum wage could deny some  \nteen-agers their chance at entry-level jobs, Federal Reserve \nChairman Alan Greenspan said today. Delivering the Fed's semiannual \neconomic report to Congress, Greenspan said increasing the wage \nprobably would push inflation higher.

He said 31 people \nwere still missing in the village in the Tyrol province, near the \nSwiss border. \n</P>\n<P>\n\tRescue workers have recovered at least 17 injured, seven of whom  \nrequired intensive care. They were being flown in by helicopter to \nthe hospital in nearby Landeck, where rescue operations were \nheadquartered \n</P>\n<P>\n\t``We're doing everything humanly possible to rescue people,''  \nsaid Austrian army spokesman Maj. Thomas Schoenherr in Landeck. \n</P>\n<P>\n\tHe said that soon after daybreak, about a dozen helicopters  \nferried some 200 troops to the avalanche site and also carried some \nof the injured back to hospitals in Landeck, 25 miles away. The \nmain road into Galtuer was blocked by an earlier avalanche. \n</P>\n<P>\n\tChildren, some of whom had been playing in the streets when the  \nsnow rumbled over them, were among the dead. \n</P>\n<P>\n\tFirefighters, tourists and residents joined in the search for  \nsurvivors, some digging in the snow with their bare hands. \n</P>\n<P>\n\t``It's a terrible day for Tyrol,'' Weingartner said Tuesday.  \n</P>\n<P>\n\tSchoenherr said that people caught in the open by the slide had  \nlittle chance of surviving more than a few minutes but those \ntrapped in their homes, where they had air to breathe, had a chance \nof surviving considerably longer. \n</P>\n<P>\n\tHe said the United States, Germany and Switzerland had all  \noffered to lend helicopters to the rescue efforts, and officials \nwere evaluating how best to use them. \n</P>\n<P>\n\tThe Galtuer avalanche was one of the worst to strike Central  \nEurope this winter as the region continues to endure its heaviest \nsnowfall in 50 years. \n</P>\n<P>\n\tTens of thousands of travelers were stranded in train stations,  \ntraffic jams and isolated resort towns across France, Italy \nSwitzerland and Austria as the avalanches buried homes, roads and \nrailways. \n</P>\n<P>\n\tMore than 60 people have died in avalanches in Europe this year.  \n</P>\n<P>\n\tIn Austria's western Vorarlberg province, rescuers near  \nGargellen found a man and a woman Tuesday who were buried a day \nearlier when an avalanche swallowed a mountain restaurant, APA \nreported. The man was still alive, but bad weather prevented an \nemergency flight to a hospital, and he died later of his injuries. \n</P>\n<P>\n\tWhere helicopters could fly, rescuers flew in food and tons of  \nmail to entire valleys that had been cut off by heavy snow. Some \n20,000 tourists were stranded in Tyrol province, and thousands of \nothers in Vorarlberg. \n</P>\n<P>\n\tIn northwestern Italy, a mass of snow and debris tore through  \nthe small village of Morgex on Tuesday, killing a 52-year-old woman \nin her home and injuring three others. \n</P>\n<P>\n\tOver the border in the Swiss state of Valais, avalanches  \nthundered down repeatedly into a mountain valley Tuesday, propelled \nby fresh snow and winds gusting up to 95 mph. \n</P>\n<P>\n\tRescuers in Evolene, Switzerland, found five more bodies Tuesday  \nfrom avalanches on Sunday.

            "text": "\n<P>\n   LANDECK, Austria _ With more snow covering the Alps than almost\nanyone could remember, Ulrike Schwarz came to the Austrian Alpine\nresort of Galtuer from her home in Germany last week with her two\nteen-age children, expecting the best skiing in years.\n</P>\n<P>\n   Since last weekend, though, it had been snowing too hard to ski.\nSo Mrs. Schwarz, her daughter, Solvieg, and her son, Christoph,\nwere relaxing in bed on the third floor of their bed-and-breakfast\nchalet in the center of Galtuer at 4 p.m. Tuesday when, with an\nalmighty rumbling, clouds of snow blasted through the windows and\nthe whole house collapsed beneath them.\n</P>\n<P>\n   ``Avalanche!'' Mrs. Schwarz screamed, pushing the children\ntoward the stairs in the back of the Tyrolean chalet, away from\nmillions of tons of highly compressed snow carrying rocks and\nshredded trees and roaring down upon the village. All three\nsurvived, climbing out of the house through a hole where the roof\nhad been, and were flown out to an emergency center in Landeck\nWednesday afternoon.\n</P>\n<P>\n   Authorities here said Wednesday that they had recovered the\nbodies of 16 people, many of them German vacationers, from the\navalanche, which was 15 to 20 feet deep and 300 to 500 feet wide.\nThey were still looking for 20 to 30 other missing people, feared\ndead under the snow.\n</P>\n<P>\n   On Wednesday, 24 hours after the Tuesday avalanche, authorities\nsaid another snowslide, up to 45 feet deep and 600 feet wide, in\nthe nearby resort of Ischgl had swept away four houses.\n</P>\n<P>\n   Two people, a man and a little girl, were pulled alive from the\nsnow Wednesday in Ischgl, but a woman was killed and six other\npeople were believed missing, according to authorities and Austrian\ntelevision.\n</P>\n<P>\n   All told, the avalanches were the worst in Austria since a\nseries of snowslides killed 56 people in the village of Blons in\nJanuary 1954.\n</P>\n<P>\n   With Galtuer and Ischgl cut off from road access Wednesday by\nthe continuing danger of avalanches, information on the latest\ndeadly slide was scarce. Maj. Thomas Schoenherr, an Austrian\nmilitary spokesman, said rescuers in Galtuer had no way of making\ntheir way down the valley Wednesday afternoon to help after the\nmost recent avalanche in Ischgl, but that others had been flown in\nby helicopter.\n</P>\n<P>\n   ``The snow is like cement and it's full of pieces of wood and\nwreckage,'' Schoenherr said.\n</P>\n<P>\n   After heavy snows over the past two weeks set off avalanches\nthat killed seven people near the southern Swiss village of Evolene\nand 19 people in France, the mood Wednesday at the height of this\nAlpine vacation season is edgy. The vacationing skiers and those\nwho cater to them live for snow; now they are finding that they can\nalso die from too much of it.\n</P>\n<P>\n   Here in Landeck, more than 20 miles east of Galtuer, Austrian\nauthorities turned a military barracks compound into an\navalanche-emergency command center for evacuating people from the\nstricken resorts and sending in food and other supplies. They\nbarred all civilian air or road traffic in the area.\n</P>\n<ANNOTATION>\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n</ANNOTATION>\n<P>\n   Landeck and Galtuer are separated by mountains more than 8,000\nto 10,000 feet high, fearsome, jagged peaks that, from the air\nWednesday, looked softened and benign under their heavy coats of\nblinding white snow.\n</P>\n<P>\n   On the ground, olive drab Austrian Huey helicopters beat their\nway down into the narrow landing field of the Landeck barracks\ncompound for most of the day, taking out about 400 vacationers and\nvillagers before a heavy snowfall late Wednesday afternoon halted\nthe flights. Other choppers loaded up with meat, cabbage, potatoes,\ntomatoes and milk for the 7,500 tourists in Ischgl and the 600 ski\nvacationers still in Galtuer.\n</P>\n<P>\n   The United States flew in six Blackhawk medical evacuation\nhelicopters to Innsbrueck airport, 60 miles northeast of Galtuer,\nto help take people out, but they could not fly in Wednesday\nbecause of the afternoon snow, Schoenherr said.\n</P>\n<P>\n   Austrian television showed video tape, apparently taken by the\nrescuers, showing dogs sniffing for survivors and long lines of\nrescuers plunging sticks into the snow and digging holes 6-to-10\nfeet deep in hopes of finding victims still alive.\n</P>\n<P>\n   The tape showed solid three-story concrete and stucco Tyrolean\nhouses torn apart as if by an earthquake, and automobiles rolled\ninto crumpled metal balls by the snow.\n</P>\n<P>\n   And it showed rescuers lifting frozen bodies out of the ice.\n</P>\n<P>\n   ``This is the most painful day of my life,'' said Wendelin\nWeingartner, the top elected official in the Austrian Tyrol region.\nEight seriously injured victims were flown to hospitals in\nInnsbrueck, where they were all said to be in stable condition\nunder treatment for hypothermia.\n</P>\n<P>\n   European authorities explained the spate of avalanches by the\nalmost unparalleled amounts of snow that have fallen since the\nsecond week of February and the high winds that have whipped it\ninto drifts and made it unstable on the crust of earlier snow.\n</P>\n<P>\n   Scores of other resorts in Austria, Switzerland and France have\nbeen cut off from road access for days by the mounting danger of\navalanches. Places like Davos, Switzerland, where the high and\nmighty of the worlds of government, industry and finance\ncongregated at a conference early this month, are now inaccessible\nby road or rail, and others, like the fashionable Austrian resorts\nof Lech and Zuers, another 60 miles west of here, have been cut off\nfor more than a week.\n</P>\n<P>\n   Yet almost all the resorts have Web sites or television\nadvertisements that boast of fantastic ski conditions, and most are\nclearly expecting a new infusion of guests as soon as the roads\nreopen.\n</P>\n<P>\n   Mrs. Schwarz had a meal in the barracks mess hall after her\nordeal and waited for her husband to come from Germany to pick up\nthe family.\n</P>\n<P>\n   Would she or her children ever go skiing again? ``Yes, but not\nwith this much snow,'' Mrs. Schwarz said.\n</P>\n",
