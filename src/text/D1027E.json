			"text":" LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- In the weeks after the beating death of gay student Matthew Shepard, this college town found itself portrayed as backwards, homophobic, an outpost of Wild West-style violence and small-mindedness. With the first of Shepard's alleged attackers set to go on trial for his life Wednesday, those images of Laramie could work to prosecutors' advantage. Betty Hoover, a jury consultant based in Raleigh, N.C., said the jurors may be eager to show that the people of Laramie, population 26,000, are progressive, law-abiding folks. ``If you've got a small town where nothing like this has ever happened, then they are definitely going to do their best to portray that they care,'' she said. ``They don't want the world to think that's the type of thing that happens in their town.'' Russell Henderson, 21, is charged with murder, kidnapping and aggravated robbery in Shepard's grisly beating death last October. The crime shocked the nation and drew condemnation from President Clinton and Congress and calls for stronger bias crime laws. The other man charged in the slaying, Aaron McKinney, 21, is set to go on trial in August. Both could get the death penalty. Authorities said Henderson and McKinney posed as homosexuals and lured the 5-foot-2, 105-pound Shepard out of a bar, kidnapped him, pistol-whipped him and stole $20. He was left for dead, tied to a fence in the 28-degree chill of Wyoming's high plains. The political science major at the University of Wyoming died five days later at a hospital. Jon Forwood, a prosecutor in nearby Cheyenne, said the university setting will probably help the defense. ``The academic community is generally perceived as one that is less in favor of the death penalty and more inclined to seek out the emotionalism as to what has happened and why,'' he said. Joseph Rice, a clinical psychologist and jury consultant in San Francisco, cited what he said is a key difference between this case and the Jasper, Texas, dragging-death trial, in which a white man was swifly convicted and sentenced to die for dragging a black man to pieces. America, he said, has ``moved further along on the issue of race and people tend to know what the `right' answer is.'' ``The homosexual issue is less cut-and-dried, a little more difficult to measure,'' Rice said. ``It's a question less people have considered in their own minds.''

			"text":" WASHINGTON (AP) -- The day before one of the men accused of killing her son was going on trial in Wyoming, the mother of gay college student Matthew Shepard lobbied tearfully for hate-crime laws that could deter future acts of violence. Her plea was seconded by a relative of James Byrd Jr., the black man who was chained to the back of a pickup truck last summer and dragged to his death over East Texas roads. Judy Shepard and Byrd nephew Daryl Verrett appeared at a Washington news conference organized by the Human Rights Campaign and the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, urging Congress and state legislatures to enact new statutes against hate crimes. ``There is no guarantee that these laws will stop hate crimes from happening. But they can reduce them,'' Mrs. Shepard said haltingly, her statement punctuated by sobs. ``They can help change the climate in this country, where some people feel it is okay to target specific groups of people and get away with it.'' Her son, a University of Wyoming freshman, was pistol-whipped, lashed to a fence and left for dead last October. He died in a hospital five days later. The first of Shepard's two alleged attackers, Russell Henderson, goes on trial Wednesday. Mrs. Shepard declined to discuss the trial, saying only that she and her husband ``want to allow justice to run its course.'' In Byrd's case, the first of three white men accused in his slaying, white supremacist John William King, was sentenced last month to death by lethal injection. Byrd's nephew took issue with Texas Gov. George W. Bush and others who question the need for special hate-crime statutes. Bush said Monday: ``People, when they commit a crime, have hate in their heart. I think it's hard to distinguish between one degree of hate or another.'' But Verrett said hate crimes, unlike most other crimes, are meant to have impact beyond the immediate victim. ``Hate crimes are done to send a message of terror to persons of different color, religious beliefs, sexual orientations, ethnicity, nationality or etc.,'' Verrett said. ``The message is if you are in any way like this individual, you are hated, you are subhuman, you have no right to be on this earth, and if possible, all people like you should be exterminated from this earth.'' The savagery of the Shepard and Byrd slayings horrified the nation, giving new impetus to consideration of hate-crimes laws in Washington and state capitals. Measures pending in Congress would make federal prosecution of hate crimes easier and would expand existing statutes, allowing the Justice Department to prosecute crimes that were based on a person's sex, sexual orientation or disability. Now, the statute only covers crimes based on race, color, religion or national origin. More than 40 states have hate crimes laws, but only 21 cover sexual orientation. Some congressional Republicans have suggested the legislation is unnecessary because state laws protect the groups identified in the bill. And some social conservatives bridle at what they view as special protections for homosexuals. "

			"text":" LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- Police stepped up patrols today outside the courthouse for the trial of one of two men accused of murdering gay college student Matthew Shepard. There were no protesters before the court session got under way, but authorities set aside areas for them during the trial of Russell Henderson, 21. Anti-gay protesters and gay rights advocates have clashed repeatedly over the Shepard case. Henderson is accused of pistol-whipping Shepard, lashing him to a fence in Wyoming's high plains and leaving him to die last fall. Jury selection was to begin today, with opening statements scheduled for April 6. Jim Osborn, who attended grade school with Shepard and remained his friend, stopped by the courthouse on his way to work to remember Shepard. ``The most important thing is: My friend is dead,'' Osborn said. ``Matt was a person. He wasn't just a gay man. Nothing can bring him back.'' Asked about having to endure the trials of the two murder suspects, Osborn said, ``It's going to be very difficult.'' Henderson and his co-defendant, Aaron McKinney, 21, both face the death penalty if convicted in a case that has become a central focus for gay rights activists and others seeking stronger bias crime legislation. On Tuesday, Shepard's mother asked Congress and state legislatures to enact bias crime laws to deter future acts of violence. ``There is no guarantee that these laws will stop hate crimes from happening. But they can reduce them,'' Judy Shepard said at a news conference in Washington, D.C. ``They can help change the climate in this country, where some people feel it is okay to target specific groups of people and get away with it.'' Mrs. Shepard declined to discuss the trial, saying only that she and her husband ``want to allow justice to run its course.''

The trial is expected to last five weeks. "

			"text":" LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- One of two men arrested in the beating death of gay college student Matthew Shepard merely watched while the other man pistol-whipped Shepard and left him to die, a defense attorney said Wednesday as jury selection began. ``The defense will contend that Russell did not participate in the beating and did not share in the proceeds of the robbery,'' said Wyatt Skaggs, the lawyer for 21-year-old Russell Henderson. Skaggs also said the slaying wasn't premeditated. He asked potential jurors not to punish his client to redeem this small town's image in the eyes of the nation. The killing ``has literally injected into our community a feeling of guilt. The press wants us to think that we are somehow responsible for what went on Oct. 6,'' he said. ``Are any of you here going to judge this case because you feel guilty and want to make a statement to the nation?'' he asked the prospective jurors. They replied, ``No.'' Prosecutor Cal Rerucha told the prospective jurors that Shepard was ``not the same as you and I'' but that every individual should be treated equally under the Constitution. Authorities said Henderson and Aaron McKinney, 21, posed as homosexuals and lured the 5-foot-2, 105-pound Shepard out of a bar Oct. 6, kidnapped and pistol-whipped him and left him tied to a fence in the cold. The University of Wyoming student died five days later at a hospital. The crime led to demands for stronger hate-crime laws around the country. McKinney will be tried later. Both men could get the death penalty. Skaggs also told the jury candidates that the case ``is not about lifestyles.'' ``This case is not about hate. All crimes ... aren't about hate. They all come down to some real simple motives,'' he said. One prospective juror, a man in his 40s, objected quickly: ``No, I disagree. ... I think Matthew Shepard's lifestyle was part of this.'' By the end of the day, 15 of the 71 prospective jurors in the first pool had been dismissed, many for financial, medical or child-care related decisions. Jury questioning for the rest of the week will be closed to the public. Opening statements are set for April 6. The prospective jurors will be questioned individually in the judge's chambers. "

			"text":" LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- A prosecutor asked 71 prospective jurors today to set aside the emotions of pity and rage if chosen for the trial in the death of gay college student Matthew Shepard. Prosecutor Cal Rerucha also told the panel to remember that Shepard, who was beaten and left tied to a fence in near-freezing weather last fall, was ``a victim that was different, a victim that was not the same as you and I.'' But he emphasized that the Constitution requires all people to be treated fairly under the law. Rerucha's statements came as the trial of Russell Henderson began in Albany County District Court. During his comments to potential jurors, defense attorney Wyatt Skaggs shifted the blame for the killing to Henderson's co-defendant, Aaron McKinney, who was to be tried later. ``Russell Henderson was a witness to the beating of Matthew Shepard,'' Skaggs said. He also warned jurors they would be seeing ``really, really graphic'' photos during the trial. As he said this, Matthew Shepard's mother, Judy, who was in the last row of the courtroom, slowly looked down. By the lunch break, 10 prospective jurors had been dismissed for various reasons, including health and business issues. One woman was dismissed for child care reasons. During the morning session, Henderson, 21, showed little emotion and occasionally looked at the pool of possible jurors seated in the courtroom's spectator section. Henderson and the 21-year-old McKinney both face the death penalty if convicted in a case that has become a central focus for gay rights activists and others seeking stronger bias crime legislation. Opening statements were scheduled for April 6. Authorities said Henderson and McKinney, both high-school dropouts, posed as homosexuals and lured the 5-foot-2, 105-pound Shepard out of a bar last October and then kidnapped and beat him, leaving him lashed to a fence. Shepard, a political science major at the University of Wyoming, was not found for hours and died five days later at a hospital. Despite the attention given the case, there were only a few spectators in the courtroom. Fenced-off areas for protesters outside were empty. Still, police stepped up patrols today outside the courthouse because anti-gay protesters and gay rights advocates have clashed repeatedly over the case. Jim Osborn, who attended grade school with Shepard and remained his friend, stopped by the courthouse on his way to work. ``The most important thing is: My friend is dead,'' Osborn said. ``Matt was a person.

			"text":" LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- The strategy for the first defendant on trial in the beating death of gay college student Matthew Shepard is clear: blame the co-defendant. ``Russell Henderson was a witness to the beating of Matthew Shepard,'' attorney Wyatt Skaggs told prospective jurors as Henderson's trial opened Wednesday. Henderson stood by and watched while his friend Aaron McKinney brutally pistol-whipped Shepard, 21, and left him to die, Skaggs said. ``The defense will contend that Russell did not participate in the beating and did not share in the proceeds of the robbery,'' he said. Individual questioning of potential jurors continued today behind closed doors. Officials said about 30 people would be questioned. Outside the courthouse, clearly marked protest areas were empty. Both Henderson and McKinney are accused of first-degree murder, kidnapping and aggravated robbery in an attack that led to demands for stronger hate-crime laws around the country. McKinney's trial is scheduled for August. Skaggs asked prospective jurors not to punish his client for the sake of redeeming this small town's image in the eyes of the nation. ``Are any of you here going to judge this case because you feel guilty and want to make a statement to the nation?'' he said. ``The press wants us to think that we are somehow responsible for what went on October 6.''

The University of Wyoming student died five days later. Shepard's mother, Judy, remained mostly impassive during the first day of jury selection. By the end of the day, 15 of 71 prospective jurors in the first pool had been dismissed. During the session, Skaggs put his arm around Henderson and told the jurors: ``This is not a defendant, not a person, but a real live living human being. Can all of you give him a fair shot?'' "
