			"text":" Tribal rebels attacked a paramilitary convoy in restive southwest Pakistan on Thursday, killing three soldiers and injuring seven others, a senior military officer said. Gunbattles between the renegade clansmen and troops from Pakistan's Frontier Corps continued throughout the day after the attack in Baluchistan province, corps chief Major General Shujjat Zamir Dar told reporters. He described the rebels' claims that up to 50 tribesmen had been killed in the exchange of fire as \"exaggerated\" but said there had been some casualties. The clash erupted when a convoy of soldiers came under attack by armed men belonging to the Bugti tribe in the clan's stronghold of Dera Bugti, some 280 kilometers (175 miles) southeast of the provincial capital Quetta, he said. Armed men blocked a six-vehicle corps convoy containing 40 personnel that was moving towards the nearby gasfield town of Sui and opened fire. Sporadic firing continued late Thursday despite a ceasefire agreed between the two sides to remove dead and wounded from the clash site. The tribesman have been waging a months-long rebellion in a bid to win increased royalties and more jobs from the province's natural resources. Earlier corps spokesman Colonel Rizwan Malik said the tribesmen used light and heavy weapons and also rained more than 150 rockets and mortar shells on a nearby military base. He said regular army troops backed by two military helicopters had been sent to tackle the situation. \"The future line of action will be reciprocal and after today the other side should not consider paramilitary forces as weak,\" General Dar warned. Violence in Baluchistan surged after the January 2 rape of a 32-year-old doctor in her lodgings near Pakistan's largest gasfield in Sui. Thousands of troops moved into the region after a rocket barrage on the gas plant left eight people dead in January. "

			"text":" Eight soldiers were killed and 23 injured in fierce desert gunbattles with tribal rebels in Pakistan's southwestern province of Baluchistan, officials said Friday. Up to 50 tribesmen may also have died in Thursday's clashes, an opposition member of parliament and other sources said, although the government and the military dismissed the figure and it could not be independently confirmed. A ceasefire was agreed to remove the dead and wounded from the site of the day-long exchange of machinegun fire in Dera Bugti southeast of the provincial capital Quetta, officials said. \"The ceasefire is still holding,\" head of the Interior Ministry's National Crisis Management Cell, Brigadier Javed Cheema, told AFP on Friday. Fighting broke out Thursday after the heavily-armed renegade clansmen, who want more autonomy and increased benefits from the area's natural resources, ambushed paramilitary Frontier Corps soldiers. They struck as a six-vehicle military convoy containing 40 personnel was moving towards Pakistan's largest gasfield at nearby Sui -- the site of fierce clashes at the start of the year. Cheema said the attack, which he blamed on the area's dominant Bugti tribe, was \"totally unprovoked and blatant aggression\". Interior Minister Aftab Sherpao said tribesmen used light and heavy weapons and rained more than 150 rockets and mortar shells on a nearby paramilitary base from 12 different directions. Officials said regular army troops backed by two military helicopters had been sent to tackle the situation. An assertion by opposition politician Hafiz Hussain Ahmed that up to 50 tribesmen were killed in the incident was \"exaggerated,\" Sherpao and Cheema said. Tribal representatives and the clan's chieftain Akbar Bugti gave similar figures for the number of dead on their side. Baluchistan has been in the grip of a sporadic tribal revolt for more han a year but the violence surged after the January 2 rape of a 32-year-old doctor in her lodgings near the Sui gasfield. Thousands of troops moved into the region after a rocket barrage on the gas plant left eight people dead in January. "

			"headline":"Gunfights, train blast kill up to 30 in southwest Pakistan ATTENTION - UPDATES toll, ADDS rail blast ///",
			"text":" Fierce gun battles between tribal rebels and Pakistani troops in the troubled southwestern province of Baluchistan have left up to 30 people dead and more than 70 injured, an official said Friday. Fighting lasted all day Thursday after the heavily-armed clansmen, who want more autonomy and increased benefits from the area's natural resources, ambushed a convoy of paramilitary Frontier Corps soldiers, officials said. Separately, railway officials said a bomb hidden in a toilet tore through a carriage on a passenger train heading towards the provincial capital Quetta, killing one person and injuring five. The province has been gripped by a sporadic tribal revolt for more than a year but the violence surged after the January rape of a 32 year-old doctor at Pakistan's largest gas field at Sui in Baluchistan. \"According to our assessment, based on reports from security officials in the area, up to 30 people died and more than 70 injured,\" a home ministry official told AFP on condition of anonymity following the clashes. It was unclear if the toll included the figure of eight soldiers killed and 23 injured given by officials earlier for the violence at Dera Bugti, southeast of Quetta. A ceasefire was agreed late Thursday to remove the dead and wounded. \"The casualties were high because the exchange of rockets and mortar shells continued from both sides throughout the day on Thursday,\" the home ministry official said. The government has dismissed the tribesmen's claims that up to 50 people on their side alone were killed as \"exaggerated\". \"The ceasefire is still holding,\" head of the Interior Ministry's National Crisis Management Cell, Brigadier Javed Cheema, told AFP on Friday. He said the attack, which he blamed on the area's dominant Bugti tribe, was \"totally unprovoked and blatant aggression\". Interior Minister Aftab Sherpao said tribesmen used light and heavy weapons and rained more than 150 rockets and mortar shells on a nearby paramilitary base from 12 different directions. Officials said regular army troops backed by two military helicopters had been sent to tackle the situation. Authorities were also hunting the culprits behind the bombing of the Chiltan Express train heading from the eastern city of Lahore to Quetta, the latest in a series of attacks on the rail network in Baluchistan. Ghulam Rasool, deputy controller of Pakistan railways, told AFP an explosive device was placed in a toilet and detonated at 2:00 pm (0900 GMT) as the train was stopped at Much, a town 70 kilometres (43 miles) southwest of Quetta. A shadowy group called the Baluchistan Liberation Army has claimed responsibility for some of the earlier blasts targeting main railway lines in the province. Thousands of troops moved into Baluchistan after a rocket barrage on the gas plant at Sui left eight people dead in January. During the 1970s Baluchistan was the scene of a major uprising which was brutally put down by the government. "

			"text":" A fierce gunbattle between paramilitary troops and renegade tribesmen left eight soldiers dead and 23 others wounded in an insurgency-wracked area of southwestern Pakistan, a troop spokesman said Friday. Officials failed to provide information on casualties among the tribesmen in Thursday's clashes, but denied tribal elders' claims that dozens of civilians had died. Separately, a bomb exploded in the toilet of a train elsewhere in restive Baluchistan province on Friday, killing one person and wounding five others, two critically, police said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast, that happened as the train stopped in a station in the town of Mach, near Quetta, the provincial capital. It follows a series of small explosions targeting Baluchistan's railways in the past two months and blamed on ethnic Baluch nationalists. Tensions in the region escalated Thursday when tribesmen ambushed a convoy of troops and fired rockets at a military base on the outskirts of Dera Bugti, 300 kilometers (185 miles) southeast of Baluchistan province's capital, Quetta. The ensuing battle lasted 16 hours, ending early Friday after the two sides agreed on a cease-fire, said a Frontier Corps spokesman, Lt. Col. Rizwan Malik. He said eight soldiers were killed and 23 injured but gave no details on any casualties among the attackers or other tribespeople. Intelligence sources on Thursday told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity that at least 16 tribesmen were killed in the fighting. Dera Bugti lies about 50 kilometers (30 miles) from Pakistan's main gas field at Sui. Clashes between troops and tribesmen demanding more returns from the natural resources extracted on their territory are common. Baluchistan was rocked by a tribal insurgency in the 1970s and violence has surged again this year. Hundreds of supporters from ethnic Baluch nationalist parties on Friday staged a protest outside the provincial assembly in Quetta against what they said were high civilian casualties from Thursday's clashes. Sardar Akhtar Mengal, an opposition politician and former Baluchistan chief minister, claimed the army had \"ruthlessly\" killed over 50 innocent people, including women, children and minority Hindus in Dera Bugti. He said the government was concealing civilian deaths, and called for a seven-day period of mourning in the province. No government official was immediately available Friday to answer Mengal's claim. On Thursday, Interior Minister Aftab Khan Sherpao told Parliament in Islamabad, \"There were some casualties, but it is wrong to say that 40 or 70 people were killed.\" Sherpao said the troops opened fire only when they came under attack. Pakistan has deployed thousands of soldiers and set up a garrison at the main gas field near Dera Bugti, since rocket attacks blamed on tribesmen killed eight people in early January and disrupted gas supplies across the country. A parliamentary committee has been set up to examine the tribesmen's claims for greater royalties from the gas reserves and their other grievances. It is expected to make its recommendations to the government soon. "

			"text":" Hundreds of people fled their homes in a remote southwest Pakistan town Saturday fearing renewed clashes after a rebel tribal chief warned them to take care of their safety, officials said. Raziq Bugti, spokesman for the provincial government of Baluchistan, said the exodus was sparked in the town of Dera Bugti, 245 kilometres southeast of Quetta after the chief told officials and paramilitary forces to leave. \"Hundreds of government officials have left their homes with their families,\" he said. He said the tribal chief, Nawab Akbar Bugti, had also set a deadline of 3:00 pm (1000 GMT) Saturday for everyone to leave. There are no family ties between the tribal chief and the government spokesman. Security forces were on high-alert to deal with any untoward situation in the area where fierce gun battles between tribal rebels and Pakistani troops have killed at least 30 people and wounded more than 70. Fighting lasted all day Thursday after the heavily-armed clansmen, who want more autonomy and increased benefits from the area's natural resources, ambushed a convoy of paramilitary Frontier Corps soldiers. The whereabouts of Nawab Akbar Bugti was unknown, however, District administrator Abdul Samad Lasi said 90 percent the Dera Bugti population had left town. Baluchistan has been gripped by a sporadic tribal revolt for more than a year but the violence surged after the January rape of a 32 year-old doctor at Pakistan's largest gas field at Sui. Thousands of troops moved into Baluchistan after a rocket barrage on the gas plant at Sui left eight people dead in January.

			"text":" Thousands of government workers and their families have evacuated a remote town in southwestern Pakistan, a senior official said, amid fears of renewed fighting between renegade tribesmen and security forces after clashes left at least 30 people dead. Abdul Samad Lasi, a senior official at Dera Bugti, said they had received reports from intelligence and security officials that more than 1,500 armed men from the dominant local Bugti tribe had taken up positions in mountains outside the town and were waiting for an order to attack government installations. A security official, who requested anonymity, said that paramilitary reinforcements were being sent to the region to support an already-strong troop presence. The government and tribal forces fought a 16-hour gunbattle in Dera Bugti on Thursday that officials say left at least eight troops and 22 tribesmen dead. Tribal representatives claim at least 50 of their people died. They agreed to a cease-fire early Friday. Lasi said government officials and their families starting leaving the town on Saturday morning in vehicles escorted by paramilitary troops after receiving a warning from the chief of the Bugti tribe, Nawab Akbar Bugti, that he could not guarantee their safety. \"Yes, he (Bugti) has asked all government official to leave Dera Bugti before 3 p.m. (1000 GMT) today, and they are leaving with their families,\" he told The Associated Press in a telephone interview from the town. Lasi said all 3,314 officials and their families would leave Dera Bugti, which lies about 50 kilometers (30 miles) from Pakistan's main gas fields and 300 kilometers (185 miles) southeast of the provincial capital, Quetta. The tribesmen, who have demanded more revenues for natural resources extracted from their territory, often launch attacks on government targets in restive areas of Baluchistan, but violence has escalated this year and the army has deployed thousands of soldiers and set up a garrison at the gas fields. A parliamentary committee has been set up to examine the grievances of the tribesmen in Baluchistan _ the biggest and poorest of Pakistan's four provinces _ which was roiled by insurgency in the 1970s. The committee is expected to make its recommendations to the government soon. Bombs exploded on two trains in Baluchistan on Friday killing two people and wounding eight. There was no claim of responsibility for the attacks, the latest in a series of small explosions to hit the state-run rail network in the province. "

			"text":" Four people were injured and a powerline and a government office damaged in three separate bomb blasts in southwestern Pakistan's restive Baluchistan province, officials said Sunday. Two blasts caused by home-made bombs rocked the remote town of Turbat, some 500 kilometres (310 miles) west of the provincial capital Quetta, late Saturday, Baluchistan home secretary Humayun Khan told AFP. In one of the blasts, close to the wall of the irrigation department, four people were injured. The other blast, near a paramilitary camp, damaged a main power line, Khan said. The third blast late Saturday was in the provincial capital Quetta. It broke the windows of Federal Investigation Agency office but there were no casualties, Khan said. A spokesman for the little-known Baloch Liberation Front, who identified himself as Colonel Doda, called the Quetta Press Club and claimed responsibility for two bomb blasts in Turbat. Also late Saturday 39 devotees were killed and scores injured in a powerful bomb blast at the memorial of a Muslim Sufi saint in the remote town of Fatahpur, around 300 kilometres from Quetta. Baluchistan has been gripped by a sporadic tribal revolt for more than a year but violence surged after the January rape of a 32 year-old doctor at Pakistan's largest gas field at Sui.

			"headline":"Armed tribesmen surround hundreds of troops in restive Pakistani tribal town, official says",
			"text":" Armed tribesmen have surrounded some 300 paramilitary troops and government officials at a base in a southwestern Pakistani town where fears of fresh fighting between renegade tribesmen and troops have forced thousands of residents to flee for safety, an official said Sunday. The tribesmen have set up road blocks and dug trenches along roads into Dera Bugti, a town of about 84,000 people which lies 300 kilometers (185 miles) southeast of the Baluchistan provincial capital, Quetta, Baluchistan Gov. Awais Ahmed Ghani said. Helicopters were airlifting supplies to the troops to avoid traveling by road and confrontation with the tribesmen, Ghani told reporters in Quetta. More than 3,000 government employees and their families escaped Saturday in vehicles under paramilitary escort from Dera Bugti after a 16-hour battle in the town last week. Ghani said up to 45 people, including eight soldiers, were killed in the fighting. On Sunday, about 3,000 people, mostly women and children of local Bugti tribesmen, also left the town because they fear fresh fighting, said top administrator Abdul Samad Lasi. He said they were camped in the open outside Dera Bugti or sheltering with relatives in neighboring towns. \"The situation in Dera Bugti is very tense. You can expect anything (to happen),\" Lasi told The Associated Press by satellite telephone from the town. Thursday's fighting in Dera Bugti _ about 50 kilometers (30 miles) from Pakistan's main gas fields _ was an alarming escalation of a low-level tribal rebellion in Baluchistan, the country's poorest province. A cease-fire has been holding since early Friday. Citing intelligence information, Lasi said about 5,000 armed Bugti tribesmen have taken up position on mountains near the town, and that the paramilitary Frontier Corps was ranged against them. \"If they (the Bugti tribesmen) make any move, if they open fire or attack, the government will give full response,\" he said. Army spokesman Maj. Gen. Shaukat Sultan said additional army troops have been sent to the gas fields at Sui to strengthen security, but denied the army was involved in an operation against the Bugti tribesmen. Nawab Akbar Bugti, the chief of Bugti tribe in Dera Bugti, claimed that hundreds of his armed supporters have taken up positions on mountains near the town and they were ready to face the security forces. \"We have every right to defend ourselves,\" Bugti told AP by satellite telephone from the town. \"The government wants to kill us. They want to defeat us. They want to loot our resources,\" he said. Interior Minister Aftab Khan Sherpao told reporters in the capital, Islamabad, that tribal fighters were digging in around Dera Bugti and destroying roads. He described these as \"serious developments,\" but maintained the government wanted to resolve the situation through talks. Tribesmen are demanding more returns from the natural gas extracted from their territory and resent the army's moves to set up garrisons in the region. Attacks against government targets are common in many parts of the province and have grown in intensity this year. A parliamentary committee has been set up to examine the grievances of the tribesmen in Baluchistan, which was roiled by insurgency in the 1970s, and make recommendations to the government. "

			"headline":"17 minority Hindus were killed during fighting between tribesmen and troops in tense Pakistani town, official says",
			"text":" Seventeen minority Hindus were killed when their temple was hit by rockets during fighting between renegade tribesmen and security forces in a restive tribal town in southwestern Pakistan last week, a government official said Monday. The fighting in the town of Dera Bugti erupted last Thursday after the tribesmen allegedly attacked a convoy of pickup trucks carrying paramilitary troops along a mountain road. Officials have said up to 45 people, including eight soldiers, were killed in the clashes between the Frontier Corps troops and Bugti tribesmen, who dominate Dera Bugti. It was an alarming escalation of a low-level rebellion in Baluchistan, the country's poorest province, where tribesmen are demanding more returns from the natural gas extracted from their territory and resent the army's moves to set up garrisons in the region. Abdul Samad Lasi, the top government administrator in the area, said Monday that several homes of Hindus near the temple in Dera Bugti also were damaged by rockets in the fighting. \"This is true that some 17 Hindus were killed and their temple was severely damaged,\" Lasi said. \"Both sides were shooting at each other. It is difficult to say whose fire destroyed the temple,\" Lasi told The Associated Press by satellite telephone from inside a base at Dera Bugti where government officials and paramilitary troops are surrounded by armed tribesmen. On Sunday, Awais Ahmed Ghani, the governor of southwestern Baluchistan province where Dera Bugti is located, said some 300 troops and government officials are holed up at the base. Helicopters were airlifting them supplies. The tribesmen have reportedly set up road blocks and dug trenches along roads into Dera Bugti. Lasi said they had dug more trenches about 500 to 1,000 meters (yards) from the base. On Sunday, about 3,000 people, mostly women and children of local Bugti tribesmen, left Dera Bugti, a day after 3,000 government employees and their families, fearing more fighting in the town, located some 300 kilometers (185 miles) southeast of Quetta, Baluchistan's provincial capital. Lasi said Sunday that about 5,000 Bugti tribesmen have taken up positions in mountains near Dera Bugti. Tribal chief Nawab Akbar Bugti vowed to fight the government, saying hundreds of his supporters were ready to face the security forces. On Sunday, authorities filed a case against Bugti, one of his grand sons and 150 of his supporters for involvement in the attack on the troops on Thursday near Dera Bugti, said Shoaib Nausherwani, Baluchistan's home minister. Registration of a case is seen as the first step by the government before arresting someone wanted for wrongdoing. Nausherwani said no arrests have been made so far. Dera Bugti is a remote district with population of 84,000, about 50,000 living inside the town, including a small community of Hindus. Pakistan is an Islamic state, but about 3 percent of its 150 million people are from other faiths, mostly Hindus and Christians. "

			"headline":"Pakistan probes tribal link to deadly shrine bomb",
			"text":" Investigators suspect rebel tribesmen may have been involved in the weekend bombing of a religious shrine in Pakistan's restive southwest that killed 39 people, police said Monday. Police have largely ruled out sectarian rivalry and say Saturday's attack on the holy site may be linked to bloody clashes two days earlier between government forces and nationalist clans in the unruly province of Baluchistan. UN Secretary General Kofi Annan expressed outrage after the bomb ripped through a crowd of devotees celebrating the anniversary of the death of a 19th century Sufi Muslim saint in the remote town of Fatahpur. No one has claimed responsibility for the blast. \"There is a strong possibility that the attack could be a reaction to the situation in Dera Bugti, because of the violence there,\" Baluchistan police chief Chaudhry Muhammad Yaqub told AFP. He did not elaborate. Dera Bugti, some 160 kilometres (99 miles) from the shrine, was the scene of fierce gunbattles on Thursday between troops and tribesmen, who are waging a revolt in a bid to win more royalties from the province's natural resources. Pakistan Interior Minister Aftab Sherpao has said that eight security personnel and 21 tribesmen including two Hindu minority members were killed in the battles, while 34 people were injured. Yaqub said investigators had rejected the possibility of sectarian elements behind the attack on the shrine memorial as members of the rival Sunni and Shiite Muslims communities had visited it. Up to 20,000 people had gathered at the shrine on Saturday evening, most of them from nearby towns and villages. Sufism is a semi-mystical strain of Islam that believes music, dance and song are ways of reaching God. However Yaqub added that some Muslims resent people dancing and singing at shrines and a number of such people in the area were being quizzed. No arrests had been made, he said. The death toll from Saturday's bomb blast remained at 39, Yaqub said, dismissing local media reports that more bodies had been discovered at the scene. Annan condemned the attack \"in the strongest terms\", saying it appeared to have targeted civilians, the UN chief's spokesman Fred Eckhard said. The secretary general also called for restraint after the \"brazen and cowardly act\". Police said Sunday they were also investigating whether the bombing had targeted the custodian of the shrine, Sadiq Ali Shah, who had been involved in a dispute with relatives and who last year survived an assassination attempt. Shah escaped unhurt. However his brother Syed Kamil Shah poured cold water on the theory, saying the attack was part of a \"terrorism wave\" in the region. Since the beginning of the year Baluchistan has been hit by frequent, low-level bombings aimed at government and military institutions as well as the railway network. Thousands of troops moved into Baluchistan after eight people died in a rocket attack on Pakistan's largest gas plant at Sui, which the tribesmen said was sparked by the rape of a female doctor at the installation. During the 1970s the government brutally put down a major nationalist uprising in Baluchistan, leading to long-lasting distrust and resentment on both sides. "
