            "text": "\n<P>\nAfter a week of steadily increasing seismic rumbling,\nMount St. Helens on Friday burped a tall column of steam and ash that\nofficials said was probably not a precursor to a large sustained\neruption from the most active volcano on the West Coast.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe volcano is being closely monitored in part because of its\ncataclysmic explosion in 1980. The explosion killed 57 people,\ntriggered the largest landslide in recorded history and blew 520\nmillion tons of ash eastward across the United States.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe plume from Friday's 24-minute noontime eruption rose 10,000\nfeet before drifting away in light winds on a spectacularly clear\nautumn day. No injuries or damage to property were reported.\n</P>\n<P>\nWhen the eruption ended, government monitoring instruments showed a\nsharp decrease in the seismic activity that in recent days had been\nregistering as many as four small earthquakes per minute on the\nmountain, located in a sparsely populated area of southwest\nWashington.\n</P>\n<P>\n``This was a relatively small eruption,'' said John Major, a\nhydrologist with the U.S. Geological Survey. He said USGS observers\nnear the volcano reported that no molten rock flowed from the point in\nthe mountain's lava dome where the steam vented.\n</P>\n<P>\nSpeaking at a news conference, Major said the eruption appeared to\nhave punched a hole about 100 feet in diameter in the glacial ice that\ncovers part of the mountain's horseshoe-shaped dome. He said there was\na small increase in melting ice and snow off the volcano but no\nreported mudflows, or lahars, which historically have been damaging\nconsequences of volcanic eruptions in the Cascade Range.\n</P>\n<P>\nAfter the 1980 eruption, a lahar traveled 50 miles from Mount St.\nHelens, ripping out bridges and destroying homes.\n</P>\n<P>\nIn comparison, Friday's eruption was a ``hiccup,'' USGS geologist\nTom Pierson told reporters.\n</P>\n<P>\n``This is exactly the kind of event we have been talking about and\nanticipating,'' Major said. He noted there is no evidence that a major\nflow of gas-rich molten rock, which could trigger a sustained\neruption, has ascended from its known location seven miles underground\nto the top of the mountain.\n</P>\n<P>\nAbsent such a flow of molten rock, USGS scientists have said it is\nunlikely that recent increases in seismic activity on Mount St. Helens\nwill result in a significant eruption that could endanger people or\nproperty outside the immediate vicinity.\n</P>\n<P>\nMajor compared Friday's ``small explosive eruption'' to the\nactivity that came to be regarded as normal in the six years after the\n1980 eruption.\n</P>\n<P>\nIn those years after Mount St. Helens literally blew its head off,\nmore than a dozen lava eruptions built a rock dome inside the\nmountain's crater. That dome is now partially covered by a glacier,\nwhich is growing because the edges of the mountain crater shades snow\nand ice from summertime sun.\n</P>\n<P>\nUSGS scientists will keep a close eye on their instruments, Major\nsaid, and if seismic activity levels off for several consecutive days\nthey may be able to conclude that the threat of more eruptions has\npassed.\n</P>\n",

            "text": "\n<P>\nJust before noon on Friday, seismometers at the Cascades Volcano\nObservatory in Vancouver, Wash., wiggled in a familiar pattern. Soon\nafterward came confirmation that Mount St. Helens had erupted for the\nfirst time since 1986.\n</P>\n<P>\nAfter the mountain's cataclysmic explosion in 1980, the volcano\nerupted more modestly an additional 21 times, each usually\naccompanied by a characteristic seismic signal.\n</P>\n<P>\n\"Events like this were very common between 1981 and 1985, so this is\nnot unusual or extraordinary by any means,\" Dr. Jon J. Major, a\ngeologist at the observatory, said at a news conference on Friday\nafternoon.\n</P>\n<P>\nMount St. Helens is one of several large volcanoes in Washington,\nOregon and California that are part of the tectonically active Ring\nof Fire around the Pacific Ocean. The volcanoes can lie dormant for\ncenturies, then revive, sometimes catastrophically. Before 1980,\nMount St. Helens had last erupted in 1857.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe pulsations of steam and dust on Friday, described by Major as \"a\nrelatively small burp,\" sent a gray-white plume nearly 10,000 feet\ninto the air. After the eruption, small earthquakes that had been\nrumbling around the volcano for the last week stopped, suggesting\nthat pressures that had been building up had been relieved for now.\nSeismic activity resumed later in the afternoon, Major said, but at a\nquieter level.\n</P>\n<P>\n\"This event is pretty much what we expected and anticipated over the\nlast several days, a relatively small explosion from the lava dome,\"\nMajor said. Scientists cannot say whether the volcano will now calm\ndown or whether more eruptions will occur.\n</P>\n<P>\nAt the time of the eruption, scientists aboard a helicopter were\ntaking measurements using a thermal imager, a device that measures\nheat from a distance. The instrument's readings showed that the site\nof the eruption was not particularly hot, indicating that the\neruption of steam and ash had originated from at least several\nhundred feet underground.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe flow of water out of the crater increased slightly, Major said,\nbut there was no danger of floods or mudslides. Scientists said they\nsaw no signs that would lead them to worry that a larger, dangerous\neruption was imminent.\n</P>\n<P>\n\"There is no indication magma has worked its way up to the surface,\"\nMajor said.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe belch on Friday might have instead been the denouement of some\nunderground indigestion from six years ago.\n</P>\n<P>\nThen, as in the last week, a swarm of small quakes rumbled around the\ndome, a bulge 925 feet high and a half-mile wide at the center of the\ncrater, but then the ground quieted without a new eruption. Analyzing\nthe patterns of shaking, scientists said fresh magma, molten rock,\nhad risen from deep below to the base of the dome, but had not broken\nthrough to the surface.\n</P>\n<P>\nMajor said the working hypothesis was that the eruption on Friday was\nsomehow related to the 1998 events. \"Exactly how it is related is\nstill a matter of speculation,\" he said.\n</P>\n",

But scientists said\nthey did not expect an eruption on the magnitude of the May 1980\nexplosion that killed 57 people and caused widespread destruction.\n</P>\n<P>\nOfficials on Saturday evacuated an observatory five miles from the\ncrater and warned that people with respiratory diseases could be\naffected if large amounts of ash became airborne.\n</P>\n<P>\nHundreds of excited tourists who had flocked to Mount St. Helens in\nrecent days were forced to move to a lookout point several miles\nbelow, causing a deep traffic jam on the one winding road that leads\nfrom this small town in southwestern Washington up to the mountain.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe 2,100 residents of this town and others near the mountain,\nhowever, were not evacuated. Officials, including Interior Secretary\nGale A. Norton, who held a news conference Saturday afternoon in\nnearby Vancouver, Wash., said their houses were far enough away -- 30\nmiles to the west -- to be safe.\n</P>\n<P>\n\"This is red alert,\" Norton said, adding, \"Overall, we are very\nfortunate that no one lives directly in the area that would be most\nimpacted.\"\n</P>\n<P>\nC. Daniel Miller, a scientist at the U.S. Geological Survey, said he\nexpected an eruption \"larger than what we saw on Friday, probably by\nquite a bit.\"\n</P>\n<P>\nThe 50-minute tremor \"is the kind of seismic signal that occurs not\nwhen rock is breaking, but when magma is actually moving up in the\nthroat of the volcano,\" Miller said at a news conference Saturday\nevening.\n</P>\n<P>\n\"That's the sort of thing that frankly sends a chill up the back of a\nvolcanologist,\" he said.\n</P>\n<P>\nScientists said Saturday that they saw more signs of deformation at\nthe south side of the lava dome, a half-mile wide, 925-foot high\nbulge at the center of the volcano's crater.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe crew aboard a helicopter taking measurements on Saturday reported\nthe smell of rotten eggs, probably hydrogen sulfide emanating from\nmagma. Until then, scientists had not detected significant amounts of\nvolcanic gases. Gas-rich magma is more likely to erupt explosively.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe greatest danger was expected to be potentially large ash plumes,\nwhich could shoot tens of thousands of feet up. The ash could be\naccompanied by lava flow and possibly blow much farther northwest,\ndepending on the weather, and cause health problems for anyone with\nasthma or other respiratory diseases, said Dr. Thomas Pierson, a\ngeologist with the geological survey.\n</P>\n<P>\nAnd if the mountain glacier melted as a result of an eruption, it\ncould create a \"debris flow\" cascading down the mountain, officials\nsaid.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe earthquakes recorded over the past week, subsiding briefly after\nthe Friday explosion, were the most intense seismic activity on the\nmountain since before the massive May 1980 eruption, which killed 57\npeople and caused widespread destruction.\n</P>\n<P>\nBefore Friday, the mountain had been dormant for 18 years.

But scientists expect the impending\neruption to be much smaller than the 1980 blast.\n</P>\n<P>\nA day after the volcano spewed a plume of steam and ash thousands of\nfeet (meters) into the air, there was a very brief steam release\nSaturday _ a puff of white cloud, followed by a dust-raising\nlandslide in the crater. A volcanic tremor signal that came next was\nwhat prompted the heightened alert level.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe signal \"was far stronger after today's steam eruption\" than the\ntremor that followed Friday's blast, Steele said. \"We were picking it\nup throughout western Washington and into central Oregon. Yesterday\nwe had a very weak tremor signal.\"\n</P>\n<P>\nA tremor _ a steady vibration _ \"indicates movement of gases or fluid\nwithin the volcano,\" Steele said, while individual earthquakes\nindicate \"a pounding and breaking of rock.\"\n</P>\n<P>\nSaturday's tremor lasted about an hour before it was drowned out by a\nseries of earthquakes _ one or two a minute, with a maximum magnitude\nof \"well over 2,\" said Tom Yelin, a USGS seismologist at the UW lab\nin Seattle.\n</P>\n<P>\nInterior Secretary Gale Norton, who flew over the mountain Saturday,\nsaid the seismic activity has weakened the 1,000-foot (300-meter)\nlava dome that began forming in the volcano's crater after the 1980\neruption.\n</P>\n<P>\nNorton said the chances of an eruption or lava flow have increased,\nand that the volcano most likely will see moderate ash eruptions.\n</P>\n<P>\n\"The greatest concern at this point is an ash plume and the spread of\nash itself that might come from an explosion,\" Norton said. \"This is\na concern for aircraft travel.\"\n</P>\n<P>\nThe growing consensus among scientists is that new magma is probably\nentering the volcano's upper levels, possibly bringing with it\nvolatile gases that could lead to eruptions, said Bill Steele at the\nUniversity of Washington's seismic laboratory in Seattle.\n</P>\n<P>\nExplosions from the crater could occur without warning, possibly\nthrowing rock onto the flanks of the volcano, the USGS said in a news\nrelease. Still, scientists said the evacuation of the observatory was\nprimarily a precaution in case of heavy ash discharge, which could\nmake it difficult to drive.\n</P>\n<P>\n\"We still feel the risk is confined to this area,\" Pierson said.\n</P>\n<P>\nNo communities are near Mount St. Helens; the closest, Toutle, is 30\nmiles (48 kilometers) west.\n</P>\n<P>\nNear the town, an impromptu tailgate party was under way along the\nshore of Silver Lake, which offers a straight-on view of the mountain\nfrom a safe distance.\n</P>\n<P>\nDozens of cars lined both sides of State Route 504, their festive\noccupants spilled out along the roadside. Folks set up lawn chairs\nand cameras on tripods. Radios were tuned to news reports, and a\nnearby pizza joint was doing a thriving business.\n</P>\n<P>\n\"I missed it the first time back in the '80s eruption and I certainly\nwasn't going to this time,\" said welder Dean Strahm, 48, of Gold Bar,\nwho brought camping gear and a cooler and planned to stay all night.\n\"It's a once-in-a-lifetime experience so I thought I'd come on down.\"\n</P>\n<P>\nThe 1980 blast obliterated the top 1,300 feet (390 meters) of the\nvolcano, devastated miles (kilometers) of forest and buried the North\nFork of the Toutle River in debris and ash as much as 600 feet (180\nmeters) deep.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe latest seismic activity \"probably just reflects the fact that\nmore rock needs to be broken for magma to reach the surface,\" said\ngeologist Dan Dzurisin at the U.S. Geological Survey's Cascades\nVolcanic Observatory in Vancouver, Washington, about 50 miles (80\nkilometers) south.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe 1980 eruption reamed open the route to the surface, and for six\nyears smaller eruptions piled lava into the massive dome that marks\nthe main conduit for magma. Friday's relatively small eruption, which\ngenerated a plume of ash and smoke 16,000 feet (4,800 meters) high,\nwas the first since a 1986 dome-building event at the volcano.\n</P>\n<P>\nScientists had believed the recent flurry of shallow earthquakes may\nreflect movement of magma that came up the volcano's pipe during a\n1998 swarm of quakes, but Pierson said Saturday's activity suggested\nat least some new magma was involved, making a larger explosion more\nlikely.\n</P>\n<P>\nAir sampling had detected only tiny amounts of the volcanic gases\nthat new magma produces, but scientists said the gases could be\nsealed inside the system or have been dissolved by water on the\nmountain. The volcano holds a 600-foot (180-meter)-deep glacier.\n</P>\n<P>\nMelting of the glacier could trigger debris flows down onto the\nbarren pumice plain at the foot of the mountain, the USGS said,\nnoting a \"very low probability\" that downstream communities would be\naffected.\n</P>\n<P>\nFew people live near the mountain, the centerpiece of the Mount St.\nHelens National Volcanic Monument in the Gifford Pinchot National\nForest about 100 miles (160 kilometers) south of Seattle.\n</P>\n",

And far\nfrom running away, people like Denise Horton, who lives 130 miles\naway in Sandy, Ore., are traveling hours to get here, bursting with\nanticipation for the eruption.\n</P>\n<P>\n\"It's like waiting for a parade that's late,\" said Horton, who opened\na hot dog stand on the mountain, selling mostly to reporters who were\namong the dozens camped out at the lookout point. \"It's like waiting\nfor a baby.\"\n</P>\n<P>\nThe fact that they are here is testament to the vast forecasting\ngains of scientists, who are armed with new technology and skills\nhoned from the 1980 eruption, which killed 57 people, obliterated 200\nhouses and spawned worldwide interest in the study of volcanoes.\n</P>\n<P>\nSeismometers pinpoint the tiny earthquakes that have been shaking\nMount St. Helens for the past week and a half. Global positioning\nsystem sensors detect outward bulges as slight as a fraction of an\ninch. Instruments aboard a helicopter sniff out gases seeping out of\nthe rocks below and identify hot spots.\n</P>\n<P>\n\"There's really been a revolution,\" said Dr. William E. Scott of the\nU.S. Geological Survey's Cascades Volcano Observatory in Vancouver,\nWash., which is monitoring the mountain and holding twice-daily news\nconferences.\n</P>\n<P>\nBut for all their high-tech gadgetry, scientists still do not have a\ndirect way to answer the questions they most want to answer: Where is\nthe molten rock beneath the volcano? And where is it going?\n</P>\n<P>\n\"We don't know where it is,\" said William Steele, a seismologist at\nthe University of Washington.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe expectation is that magma -- underground molten rock -- will\nreach the surface and spill out as lava and that there will be more\neruptions like the small one that happened Friday, or larger.\n</P>\n<P>\n\"Something could happen at any time, basically,\" Scott said at a news\nconference on Sunday afternoon. Or, he said, \"It may stall out and we\nmay never see it.\"\n</P>\n<P>\nThat would disappoint Kathy Teas, who was living nearby in 1980 and\nwas evacuated from her home. Teas later moved to Oregon, but on\nSunday she was back, having spent the previous night at a campsite on\nthe mountain, eager to see an eruption.\n</P>\n<P>\n\"Here I am at 52 and I'm back here again,\" she said. \"To have the\nopportunity to witness this is something I can't pass up.\"\n</P>\n<P>\nFrom the pattern of seismic shakings before and after the 1980\neruption, seismologists laboriously constructed a fuzzy picture of\nthe volcano's workings, the equivalent of a prenatal sonogram. It\nindicated a deep magma chamber about four miles underground and a\nshallower one perhaps a mile below the crater.\n</P>\n<P>\nBut unlike hurricanes, which allow meteorologists to make detailed\nobservations by airplanes and satellites, a volcano eruption develops\nmostly out of sight, hundreds to thousands of feet underground.\n</P>\n<P>\n\"We can't take measurements in the interior,\" said Dr. Anthony Qamar,\na professor of geophysics at the University of Washington.\nInformation like the volcano's internal temperatures and pressures\ncan only be guessed at.\n</P>\n<P>\nInstruments on or hovering above the surface offer only indirect\nsuggestions of what is happening. Volcanologists must sift through\ncompeting plausible explanations for what they observe and what they\ndo not.\n</P>\n<P>\nThus, when a new event occurs, like the continuous, 50-minute,\nlow-frequency tremor on Saturday, the scientists sometimes need to\nquickly revise their thoughts.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe swarms of earthquakes, a few a minute, have been interpreted as\nthe breaking of rocks by the buildup of pressure. The tremor --\naccompanied by a cessation in the earthquakes -- suggested that the\nmagma had broken through and was rising smoothlyleading scientists to\nsuspect an eruption might be imminent.\n</P>\n<P>\nAfter the tremor ended, the earthquakes resumed. At 3 a.m. Sunday, a\nsecond tremor occurred, this time lasting 25 minutes. Again, the\nseismic activity died down, then picked up. Through the day on\nSunday, the intensity of the earthquakes diminished somewhat. \"The\nlarger earthquakes have dropped off,\" Qamar said.\n</P>\n<P>\nThat could mean the pressure had lessened, and the volcano was\nquieting down. Or it could mean that the magma had broken through the\nrock blockage and was now pushing its way toward the surface. Or it\ncould just be a lull.\n</P>\n<P>\n\"We're not interpreting much about that decrease,\" Scott said.\n</P>\n<P>\nWhat has been unusual about the current episode is that all of the\nearthquakes have been shallow, within half a mile or so of the\nsurface. That leaves scientists wondering whether magma is rising\nfrom the deep chamber or whether the magma driving the tremors and\neruptions is left over from six years ago. Then, as now, a swarm of\nearthquakes shook the area, and scientists believe that magma rose\nupward beneath the crater, although nothing broke through as an\neruption.\n</P>\n<P>\nWhether the magma is new or old is important, because that could\ndetermine whether the eruptions will explosively shoot clouds of ash\nthat spread over a large area or, less catastrophically, just push\nout lava.\n</P>\n<P>\n\"The analogy is the old Coke can that you shake up and open,\" Scott\nsaid. \"If you shake it a whole lot and pop it open, you're going to\nget a lot of frothing and it's going to be an explosive event. But if\nyou pour it in a glass and let the gas come out and then you try to\nshake the glass, you can't get as much fizz.\"\n</P>\n<P>\nOnce scientists realized this weekend that an eruption could be\nimminent, spectators were ordered to leave an observatory five miles\nfrom the crater. But lookout points farther away were not considered\nto be in danger.\n</P>\n<P>\nHere in Toutle (pronounced TOOT-el), a town of 700 that is the\nclosest to the mountain, many residents said that while they were not\npanicking, they were concerned about an eruption causing a mudflow\ninto the three nearby rivers, which were flooded and full of floating\ndebris in 1980.\n</P>\n<P>\n\"All I can say is you better learn to respect it,\" Karen Meyers, 43,\nwho lives in Toutle and witnessed the 1980 eruption. \"I mean, last\ntime, their worst-case scenario didn't even come close to what\nhappened here. Mother Nature is going to win and you'll pay hell\ntrying to predict it.\"\n</P>\n",

Eathquakes are rumbling at a rate of one or\ntwo per minute, it added.\n</P>\n<P>\nScientists on Saturday saw an increase of fumaroles, a hole from\nwhich hot gases and vapors emanate, in St. Helens' lava dome and\ndetected carbon dioxide, the USGS said.\n</P>\n<P>\nAfter 18 years on inactivity, St. Helens roared back to life Friday\nwith a giant plume of steam and ash.\n</P>\n<P>\n\"All this suggests that a second eruption is imminent,\" said USGS\nspokeswoman Catherine Puckett. \"It could happen right now while we\nare talking, in the next few hours or tomorrow.\"\n</P>\n<P>\nFriday's eruption brought hundreds of curiosity seekers to the area\nwho were evacuated on Saturday from a five-mile (8 kilometer) radius\naround the mountain, including the USGS Johnson Ridge Observatory.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe Federal Aviation Administration on Friday warned aircraft to\navoid the area around the volcano.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe USGS has raised its alert to the maximum third level.\n</P>\n<P>\nVolcano experts have been warning of a possible imminent eruption of\nMount St. Helens for several days as seismic activity in the area\ngrew.\n</P>\n<P>\n\"This is exactly the eruption we predicted,\" the USGS's Stephanie\nHanna said Friday when St. Helens erupted.\n</P>\n<P>\nOn May 18, 1980, after weeks of quakes, slides and tremors, of\nbelching smoke, steam and ash, Mount St. Helens, a major peak in the\nCascade mountain chain, erupted.\n</P>\n<P>\nSandy McComb, 56, of Portland, Oregon, 60 miles (100 km) south,\nhelped in search and rescue operations after St. Helens' devastating\neruption, and she came to see the volcano come back to life this\nweekend.\n</P>\n<P>\n\"We had to come back here when this happened,\" she said.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe 1980 eruption blew off the upper third of the mountain, leaving a\ngaping crater 2,050-foot (400-meter) deep, 1.7-mile (2.7-km) long and\n1.3-mile (2-km) wide.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe explosions shaved off 400 meters (1,300 feet) of the mountain's\ntop, reducing it from 2,950 meters (9,680 feet) to 2,549 meters\n(8,363 feet).\n</P>\n<P>\nThe blast sent clouds of volcanic ash high into the atmosphere, where\njet streams carried it as far as the US eastern seaboard 3,000 miles\n(4,800 km) away.\n</P>\n<P>\nTowns and cities throughout the Pacific Northwest were buried in gray\nash.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe flash snow melt on the mountain triggered floods and mudslides,\nsending streams and rivers over their banks and destroying\ninfrastructure for hundreds of miles around.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe Columbia River, the main inland shipping channel from the Pacific\nOcean, was clogged with volcanic sediment and eventually had to be\ndredged.\n</P>\n<P>\nMolten lava flows devastated forests and mountain meadows, creating a\nvast wasteland of mud, magma and ash.\n</P>\n<P>\nMount St. Helens erupted again in 1986, but with nowhere near the\nsame intensity.\n</P>\n<P>\nAlthough geologists said the probability for another eruption is\nhigh, they predict it would not be anything like that of 1980.\n</P>\n",
