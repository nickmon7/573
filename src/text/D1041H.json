These are only some of the conclusions of an\nexhaustive new report by 240 scientists in 98 countries, working under\nthe auspices of the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network.

            "text": "\n<P>\nFor some time, scientists have predicted that the world's coral reefs\nwill be among the first ecosystems to suffer devastating damage from\nglobal warming. Some reefs, however, are proving surprisingly\nresilient, researchers say, not because of qualities of the corals,\nbut because of heat-tolerant algae that live with them.\n</P>\n<P>\nIt may even be possible that heat-related episodes of coral\nbleaching, which had been viewed as ominous previews of mass coral\ndeath to come, could allow these robust algae to spread, leaving\ncorals better able to survive in a warmer world.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe scientists say this strength in the face of warming will not be\nenough to save the world's coral reefs, which are threatened by\npollution, overfishing, tourism and other human activities. But if\nthe findings hold up, \"they essentially buy us time\" to address those\nissues, said Andrew C. Baker of the Marine Program of the Wildlife\nConservation Society, who led the new work.\n</P>\n<P>\nAlgae and corals live in a symbiotic relationship. Coral polyps\nabsorb and shelter the algae, and as the algae photosynthesize they\nproduce sugars that the corals use for energy. But this relationship\ncan falter when ocean water warms, Baker said. \"Basically, algae\ncells are lost from the coral host,\" he said. \"We don't know if it's\nthe algae leaving a sick coral colony or a coral ejecting a defunct\nalgae. I suspect it's a bit of both.\"\n</P>\n<P>\nThe result is coral bereft of much of its power supply. The living\npolyps that give coral reefs their color wither, usually leaving\nlifeless white skeleton reefs of calcium carbonate. It is as if the\nreefs have been bleached.\n</P>\n<P>\nBut the new research, led by Baker, suggests that heat-tolerant algae\nmay move in to replace strains lost in bleaching events. If so, he\nsaid, \"some of the doom and gloom might not be as bad as had been\nsuggested.\"\n</P>\n<P>\nThe findings are \"definitely good news,\" said Nancy Knowlton, an\nexpert on corals who directs the Center for Marine Biodiversity and\nConservation of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the\nUniversity of California, San Diego.\n</P>\n<P>\nBaker and his colleagues studied corals affected by El Nino-Southern\nOscillation events, natural disruptions of ocean currents that occur\nperiodically and that can cause ocean temperatures to rise in one\narea or another. In particular, they studied what happened to corals\nin relatively shallow waters off the Pacific coast of Panama, and in\nthe Indian Ocean off Kenya and Mauritius. All the corals they studied\nwere colonized by Symbiodinium algae, a diverse genus whose various\nspecies look alike but react differently to heat.\n</P>\n<P>\nUsing DNA analysis, they compared the algae populations at those\nthree sites with algae strains in coral reefs in the Persian Gulf,\nwhich are relatively tolerant of heat, and with other corals in the\nRed Sea, where temperatures do not normally rise as high and where\nalgae strains are less heat-tolerant.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe scientists found that reefs in Panama and Kenya, which had\nexperienced unusually high water temperatures, had high proportions\nof a heat-tolerant strain called symbiont D. By contrast, reefs off\nMauritius, where waters remained cooler, had fewer symbiont D algae.\nThey resembled the reefs of the Red Sea, Baker said.\n</P>\n<P>\nBaker said these findings, reported in the journal Nature in August,\nsuggested that when corals lost algae in a bleaching event,\nheat-tolerant algae could move in to replace them. Symbiont D \"is\nbecoming more common on reefs that are experiencing bleaching\nevents,\" Baker said. He said the findings were the first \"real-world\nevidence\" that corals might adapt to warming.\n</P>\n<P>\nBut this kind of adaptation may not be enough \"to let corals off the\nhook,\" as Knowlton of the Scripps Institution put it in an interview.\n</P>\n<P>\nFor example, according to a report issued this month by the Global\nCoral Reef Monitoring Network, scientists do not know exactly what\nconditions must exist for corals to acquire new strains of algae.\nThey do not even know if changes occur when corals recruit different\nalgae from the water around them, or if something somehow changes the\nratio of algae strains growing within them.\n</P>\n<P>\nAlso, Knowlton said, it is not yet known whether corals colonized\nwith new varieties of algae will grow as well as they once did with\nother strains. For example, she said, it could be that heat-tolerant\nalgae strains devote more of their energy to reproducing and less to\nproviding sustenance to their coral hosts. And though symbiont D is\nwidespread among the world's corals, Knowlton said, scientists do not\nknow whether all of them can support the strain.\n</P>\n<P>\nAnswers to those questions await more research, and she said the\nstudy of corals was still developing. \"If it were birds it would be\n18th- or 19th-century science -- who's living with whom, where,\" she\nsaid.\n</P>\n<P>\nHistory suggests that the coral bleaching and mortality associated\nwith the severe El Nino phenomenon of 1997-98 was a thousand-year\nevent, according to the monitoring network's coral report. That\nmeans, in theory, that there is only a 1-in-1,000 chance that similar\neffects would be seen in a given year. But, the report says, evidence\nstrongly suggests that global warming will turn severe bleaching into\n\"a regular event\" by the middle of the century. So evidence of coral\nrecovery since 1998 is encouraging, the report says.\n</P>\n<P>\n\"Some people would argue that global climate change is their biggest\nlong-term threat,\" Knowlton said, \"and it's the one we have the least\nability to do anything about. So good news on the global warming\nfront is very welcome.\"\n</P>\n<P>\nAbout half the reefs that were left badly damaged after the 1997-98\nEl Nino event have bounced back, Baker said. \"So even from a major\nevent there can be recovery,\" he said, if overfishing, habitat\ndestruction and other threats are mitigated. \"But there can't be\nrecovery if we triple- and quadruple-whammy these reefs.\"\n</P>\n",

Both areas were hard hit\nby the tsunami.\n</P>\n<P>\nNow based in Rhode Island, Hale said the tsunami may have caused\nlasting environmental damage that may take decades or longer to\nrecover from. \"This is a massive, massive erosion event,\" she said.\n</P>\n<P>\nA UN task force based in Geneva will assess two things: environmental\ndamage that threatens human health, and the toll on the ecological\nresources -- many of which support tourism and the fishing industry.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe Indian Ocean region, with its aqua, shallow seas, hosts some of\nthe most beloved and famous coral reefs in the world that support\nscores of fish species found nowhere else.

However, some\nbiologists speculated that marine mammals such as whales and dolphins\nswimming near shore when the tsunami struck may have sensed the\nstrange seas and headed for deeper waters, where the giant waves were\nbarely noticeable. Land animals may have had the same \"sixth sense\"\nto move to safety: Wildlife officials in Sri Lanka's Yala National\nPark said they have not seen evidence that many animals died, despite\nthe preserve's closeness to the ocean.\n</P>\n<P>\nScientists don't have comprehensive historical data about marine\ndamage that tsunamis can cause, especially one of this magnitude.\nThey do know that in 1883, when the Krakatoa volcano exploded and\nsent a giant tsunami washing over Indonesia, coral heads that weighed\nhundreds of tons were tossed hundreds of feet inland.\n</P>\n<P>\nAnd in 1964, when a tsunami hit Alaska, news reports noted that baby\nsalmon were killed, although it's unclear how many.\n</P>\n<P>\nThis week, dive operators and researchers began sending e-mails to\nthe WorldFish Center in Malaysia, an international fisheries research\ncenter, painting an early bleak picture of the region's treasured\ncoastal waters. On Phuket Island, one popular beach was piled with\ndead staghorn coral, starfish, gulper eels, sea cucumbers, and sea\ngrasses.\n</P>\n<P>\nIn the Maldives, dive operator Norbert Schmidt said the eastern part\nof the island was hit the worst, with dead coral and sand covering\nthe runway at Hulule International Airport. In Sri Lanka and\nThailand, coral damage is reported to be severe, and trees have\ncrashed down onto reefs, ripping many of the corals, some hundreds of\nyears old, apart.\n</P>\n<P>\n\"Many fish washed ashore, trees that were knocked down (smashed) into\nthe reefs,\" Michiru Main, a researcher who was conducting a reef\nsurvey at Mu Ko Surin, a popular dive spot in Thailand, when the\ntsunami struck, said in an e-mail. \"I can definitely say there is\ndamage in the area.\"\n</P>\n<P>\nAlready stressed from fishing and tourism, many of the reefs may be\ncovered in mud, which can block sunlight that fish and other\norganisms below them need. Meanwhile, corals, which only grow a\nfraction of an inch each year, may be excreting mucus as a defensive\nmechanism against the mud -- \"expensive in terms of energy (that)\nweakens the coral,\" e-mailed Marco Noordeloos of the WorldFish\nCenter. Noordeloos said fish populations have probably been damaged,\ntoo, although it's far too early to get a complete picture.\n</P>\n<P>\nSome scientists this week said human activity in the coastal zone\ncontributed to the immense damage on shore -- such as building\ntourist hotels too close to the water and tearing out mangrove\nforests to put in shrimp aquaculture farms throughout Asia.

            "text": "\n<P>\nBeaches around South Asia devastated by tsunamis could be restored to\ntheir former glory within a few years, but the marine life through\nwhich the huge waves passed could take centuries to recover, experts\nsaid.\n</P>\n<P>\nCoral reefs, mangroves, fish and other marine life had been damaged\nby the tsunamis which rose out of the Indian Ocean on Sunday,\ntriggered by a massive earthquake near the Indonesian island of\nSumatra.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe disaster has left more than 120,000 people dead and up to five\nmillion displaced in the region, with Indonesia, Thailand, India and\nSri Lanka the worst affected countries.\n</P>\n<P>\n\"It is so hard to say in brief, but the level of devastation of\ncoastal areas by the disaster is obvious,\" director of Conservation\nInternational in the Indonesian resort island of Bali, Ketut Sarjana\nPutra, said.\n</P>\n<P>\n\"It will take a long time to recover.\"\n</P>\n<P>\nThe ocean's seagrass bed and mangrove ecosystem would also be\naffected, Putra said, but it is the reefs that bore the brunt of the\ndestruction.\n</P>\n<P>\n\"The coral reef system might be totally destroyed. It will take\nhundreds of years to grow back,\" he said.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe health of the reefs could in turn dramatically affect the size of\nfish populations which rely on them for their habitat.\n</P>\n<P>\nLyle Vail, director of the Lizard Island Research Station on\nAustralia's Great Barrier Reef, said damage to coral reefs from a\ntsunami would likely be similar to that from a cyclone.\n</P>\n<P>\nWhen a tsunami passes, reef structures grind into each other causing\nextensive damage. In serious cases recovery would be slow as there\nwould be fewer larval animals to repopulate the coral.\n</P>\n<P>\nA major problem would be a loss of fish, displaced by the waves from\ntheir habitat, and other forms of protein which depend on the reefs.\n</P>\n<P>\nRegional marine programme co-ordinator for South and Southeast Asia\nwith the IUCN (World Conservation Union) in Colombo, Sri Lanka,\nJerker Tamelander, said damage to the marine ecosystem could be\n\"very, very serious.\"\n</P>\n<P>\n\"You have a region where the marine ecosystem is stressed and\ndegraded as it is,\" he told AFP.\n</P>\n<P>\nTamelander said many coral reefs in the Indian Ocean were just\nbeginning to recover from damage caused by the changing water\ntemperatures generated by the El Nino weather pattern.\n</P>\n<P>\n\"In the region as a whole I think we can expect very severe ecosystem\neffects,\" he said, adding the recovery process for coral reefs could\ntake \"decades to centuries\".\n</P>\n<P>\nA major problem would be the amount of silt, sand and organic matter\nchurned into the water which would then \"smother\" vegetation and\nmarine life. Coral could also have been damaged by exposure to the\nair as water was sucked back from the shore before the tsunamis hit.\n</P>\n<P>\nTamelander says in some cases mangroves, which protect the shore from\nerosion and often serve as nurseries for young fish, would also have\nbeen completel0 years,\" he said.\n</P>\n",
