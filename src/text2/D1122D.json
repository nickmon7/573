As\nthe steamy night progressed, massive crowds gathered.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe river's depth at the bridge was not immediately available, but the U.S. Army\nCorps of Engineers maintains a channel depth of at least 9 feet (three meters)\nin the Upper Mississippi from Minneapolis southward to allow for barge and other\nriver traffic.\n</P>\n<P>\nThere were 18 construction workers on the bridge at the time of the collapse,\nsaid Tom Sloan, head of the bridge division for Progressive Contractors Inc., in\nSt. Michael.

We're going to have to do it slowly and\nsafely.\"\n</P>\n<P>\nHe said police estimate that 20 to 30 people were unaccounted for, though he\nstressed that it was just an estimate. The depth of the water underneath the\nbridge is between 4 to 14 feet (1.2 to 4.3 meters), according to the Army Corps\nof Engineers.\n</P>\n<P>\nFollowing the collapse, some who were able to escape scrambled to shore and some\nsurvivors carried the injured up the riverbank for medical help. Others jumped\ninto the water to search for more survivors.\n</P>\n<P>\nAt Hennepin County Medical Center, patients had arrived in a steady stream after\nthe collapse, some unconscious or moaning, some barely breathing, others with\nserious head and back injuries, Dr. William Heegaard said.\n</P>\n<P>\n\"There was blood everywhere,\" he said.\n</P>\n<P>\nRelatives who could not find their loved ones at hospitals gathered in a hotel\nballroom Thursday morning for any news, hoping for the best.\n</P>\n<P>\nAuthorities initially said at least seven people had died, but Police Lt. Amelia\nHuffman lowered that number Thursday morning, saying, \"The medical examiner's\noffice only has four sets of remains.\" She said the initial reports were based\non the best estimates authorities had.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe first step of the federal investigation will be to recover pieces of the\nbridge and reassemble them, kind of like a jigsaw puzzle, to try and determine\nwhat happened, National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Mark Rosenker\nsaid.\n</P>\n<P>\nInvestigators also want to review video of the collapse, and were setting up a\nphone number for witnesses to call with information.\n</P>\n<P>\nAs the divers worked their way around at least a dozen submerged vehicles,\nTransportation Secretary Mary Peters announced a $5 million (euro3.66 million)\ngrant to help pay for rerouting traffic patterns around the disaster\nsite.\n</P>\n<P>\n\"We fully understand what happened and we will take every step possible to\nensure something like this will not happen again,\" Peters said.\n</P>\n<P>\nSen. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat, said up to $100 million (euro73\nmillion) in federal funds will also be available for rebuilding and\nrecovery.\n</P>\n<P>\n\"A bridge in America just shouldn't fall down,\" Klobuchar said. \"That's why we\nhave called for this investigation.\"\n</P>\n<P>\nBush also pledged the government's help.\n</P>\n<P>\n\"We in the federal government must respond, and respond robustly, to help the\npeople there not only recover, but to make sure that lifeline of activity -- that\nbridge -- gets rebuilt as quickly as possible,\" he said in Washington.\n</P>\n<P>\nIn 2005, the 40-year-old bridge had been rated as \"structurally deficient\" and\npossibly in need of replacement, according to a federal database. The span rated\n50 on a scale of 120 for structural stability in that review, White House press\nsecretary Tony Snow said.\n</P>\n<P>\n\"This doesn't mean there was a risk of failure, but if an inspection report\nidentifies deficiencies, the state is responsible for taking corrective\nactions,\" he said.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe U.S. Department of Transportation's inspector general last year criticized\nthe Federal Highway Administration's oversight of interstate bridges, saying\ninvestigators found incorrect or outdated maximum weight limit calculations and\nweight limit postings in the National Bridge Inventory and in states' bridge\ndatabases.\n</P>\n<P>\nIncorrect load ratings could endanger bridges by allowing heavier vehicles to\ncross than should be allowed, the inspector general said. The audit did not\nidentify any Minnesota bridges beyond noting that 3 percent of the state's\nbridges were structurally deficient, placing it at the low end among\nstates.\n</P>\n<P>\nPawlenty, the state's governor, said Thursday that there was no indication from\nthat and other reviews that the bridge should be shut down. Peters added that\n\"none of those ratings indicated there was any kind of danger.\"\n</P>\n<P>\nThis week, road crews had been working on the bridge's joints, guardrails and\nlights, with lane closures overnight on Tuesday and Wednesday. In 2001, the\nbridge had been fitted with a computerized anti-icing system that sprayed\nchemicals on the surface during winter weather, according to documents posted on\nthe Minnesota Department of Transportation's Web site.\n</P>\n<P>\nWednesday evening, 18 construction workers were on the bridge when it collapsed,\nsaid Tom Sloan, head of the bridge division for Progressive Contractors Inc., in\nSt. Michael.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe crew was placing concrete finish on the bridge for what he called a routine\nresurfacing project. \"It was the final item on this phase of the project.\nSuddenly the bridge gave way,\" he said.\n</P>\n<P>\n\"They said they basically rode the bridge down to the water. They were sliding\ninto cars and cars were sliding into them,\" he said. One of the workers was\nunaccounted for, he said.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe school bus had just crossed the bridge when the entire span of Interstate\n35W crumpled into the river below. The bus stayed on concrete, and the children\nwere able to escape unharmed out the back door.\n</P>\n<P>\nChristine Swift's 10-year-old daughter, Kaleigh, was on the bus, returning from\na field trip to Bunker Hills in Blaine. She said her daughter called her about\n6:10 p.m.\n</P>\n<P>\n\"She was screaming, 'The bridge collapsed,'\" Swift said. All the children got\noff the bus safely, but about 10 of the children were injured, officials\nsaid.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe collapsed bridge is just blocks from the heart of Minneapolis, near tourist\nattractions like the new Guthrie Theater and the Stone Arch Bridge. As the\nsteamy night progressed massive crowds of onlookers circulated in the area on\nfoot or bicycle, some of them wearing Twins T-shirts and caps after departing\nWednesday night's game at the nearby Metrodome early.\n</P>\n<P>\nThursday's game between the Twins and Kansas City Royals was called off, but the\nTwins decided to go ahead with Wednesday's rather than sending about 25,000 fans\nback out onto the congested highways. Inside the stadium, there was a moment of\nsilence to honor victims.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe steel-arched bridge, built in 1967, rose 64 feet (19.5 meters) above the\nriver and stretched 1,900 feet (579 meters) across the water. It was built with\na single 458-foot-long (140-meter) steel arch to avoid the need for piers that\nmight interfere with river navigation.\n</P>\n<P>\n------\n</P>\n<P>\nAssociated Press Writers Brian Bakst and Patrick Condon contributed to this\nreport from Minneapolis; Martiga Lohn contributed to this report from St.\nPaul.\n</P>\n",

            "text": "\n<P>\nDivers searched the Mississippi River for bodies still trapped beneath the\ntwisted debris of a collapsed freeway bridge, as finger-pointing began Thursday\nover a federal report two years ago that found the bridge was \"structurally\ndeficient.\"\n</P>\n<P>\nThe official death count from Wednesday evening's collapse stood at four, but\nPolice Chief Tim Dolan said more bodies were in the water. As many as 30 people\nwere reported missing, and the rescue effort had shifted to recovery. Hospital\nofficials said 79 people were injured.\n</P>\n<P>\nA strong current and low visibility hampered the search, and divers were pulled\nout of the water Thursday afternoon so it could be lowered, said Inspector Jeff\nStorms of the sheriff's department. Twelve vehicles had been located in the\nriver, officials said.\n</P>\n<P>\n\"We have a number of vehicles that are underneath big pieces of concrete, and we\ndo know we have some people in those vehicles,\" Dolan said. \"We know we do have\nmore casualties at the scene.\"\n</P>\n<P>\nThe eight-lane Interstate 35W bridge, a major Minneapolis artery, was in the\nmidst of repairs when it buckled during the evening rush hour. Dozens of cars\nplummeted more than 60 feet (18 meters) into the Mississippi River, some falling\non top one of another. A school bus sat on the angled concrete.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe bridge was Minnesota's busiest, and carried approximately 141,000 vehicles\nper day.\n</P>\n<P>\nPresident George W. Bush, who will travel to the scene of the disaster on\nSaturday, said the federal government would help rebuild the bridge in the city\nthat will host next year's Republican National Convention.\n</P>\n<P>\n\"We in the federal government must respond, and respond robustly, to help the\npeople there not only recover, but to make sure that lifeline of activity -- that\nbridge -- gets rebuilt as quickly as possible,\" Bush said.\n</P>\n<P>\nStill stung by harsh criticism of the government's sluggish response to\nHurricane Katrina, Bush talked with state and local officials in Minnesota, and\nthe administration dispatched officials to the scene.\n</P>\n<P>\nFirst lady Laura Bush will visit Minneapolis on Friday to console victims of the\ndisaster.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe U.S. House Transportation Committee quickly approved legislation Thursday\nthat would direct $250 million (euro183 million) to Minnesota to help it replace\nthe bridge. But in the Senate, Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Democrat, said it\nwas too soon to approve emergency funding for a new bridge because it is unclear\nhow much will be needed. Congress recesses for its August vacation on\nFriday.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe White House said a U.S. inspection of the 40-year-old bridge in 2005 found\nproblems. The Interstate 35W span rated 50 on a scale of 100 for structural\nstability and was classified as \"structurally deficient,\" transportation\nofficials said.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe designation means some portions of the bridge needed to be scheduled for\nrepair or replacement, and it was on a schedule for inspection every two years.\n\"It didn't mean that the bridge is unsafe,\" Transportation Secretary Mary Peters\nsaid.\n</P>\n<P>\nEarlier, at the White House, press secretary Tony Snow said while the inspection\ndid not indicate the bridge was at risk of failing, \"If an inspection report\nidentifies deficiencies, the state is responsible for taking corrective\nactions.\"\n</P>\n<P>\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty on Thursday ordered an immediate inspection of all\nbridges in the state with similar designs, but said the state was never warned\nthat the bridge needed to be closed or immediately repaired. Another inspection\nwas scheduled for completion in September.\n</P>\n<P>\n\"There was no call by anyone that we're aware of that said it should be\nimmediately closed or immediately replaced,\" Pawlenty said. \"It was more of a\nmonitor, inspect, maintain, and potentially replace it in the\nfuture.\"\n</P>\n<P>\nLater Thursday, officials alerted states to immediately inspect all steel-deck\ntruss bridges similar to the one that collapsed in Minneapolis bridge. There are\napproximately 700 such spans, according to U.S. Transportation Department\nspokesman Brian Turmail.\n</P>\n<P>\nGovernors across America scrambled Thursday to conduct bridge inspections,\nordering engineers to review the safety of thousands of structures.\n</P>\n<P>\nNearly 13 percent of America's bridges were classified as \"structurally\ndeficient\" in 2004, meaning they are deteriorating, according to a report issued\nby the Federal Highway Administration. That was 75,422 bridges out of about\n600,000 nationwide.\n</P>\n<P>\nIn the Mississippi River, divers took down license plate numbers for authorities\nto track down the vehicles' owners. Getting the vehicles out was expected to\ntake several days and involve moving around very large, heavy pieces of\nbridge.\n</P>\n<P>\nRelatives who could not find their loved ones at hospitals gathered in a hotel\nballroom Thursday for any news, hoping for the best.\n</P>\n<P>\nAs many as 50 vehicles tumbled into the river when the bridge collapsed, leaving\nthose who could escape to scramble to shore. Some survivors carried the injured\nup the riverbank, while emergency workers tended to others on the ground and\nsome jumped into the water to look for survivors. Fire and black smoke rose from\nthe wreckage.\n</P>\n<P>\n\"People who were pinned or partly crushed told emergency workers to say 'hello'\nor say 'goodbye' to their loved ones,\" Dolan said.\n</P>\n<P>\nAron Dahlgren, 23, a University of Minnesota graduate student, was driving to\nhis girlfriend's home when the bridge began to fall. He noticed overhead road\nsigns in front of him start to sink -- and then his car plummeted.\n</P>\n<P>\n\"That's the longest two or three seconds of your life,\" Dahlgren said. \"That was\nthe scariest place. I kept on thinking -- I kept on questioning, was this how I\nwas going to die. If I'd have left 30 seconds earlier, I'd have been over the\nwater.\"\n</P>\n<P>\nThe first step of the federal investigation will be to recover pieces of the\nbridge and reassemble them, much like a jigsaw puzzle, to try and determine what\nhappened, NTSB Chairman Mark Rosenker said.\n</P>\n<P>\nInvestigators also want to review video of the collapse.\n</P>\n<P>\nEngineers spotted structural problems in the bridge as far back as 1990, but\nstate officials thought patches and yearly inspections would be enough to keep\nit together, Minnesota's top bridge engineer said. This year's inspection\nstarted in June and would have been finished in September after $2.4 million\n(euro1.76 million) worth of maintenance on the deck, joints, guardrails and\nlights.\n</P>\n<P>\n\"We thought we had done all we could. Obviously something went terribly wrong,\"\nstate bridge engineer Dan Dorgan said.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe steel-arched bridge, built in 1967, rose 64 feet (19.5 meters) above the\nriver and stretched 1,900 feet (579 meters) across the water.
