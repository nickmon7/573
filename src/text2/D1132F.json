            "text": "\n<P>\nYou may not have flippers or a\nshell, but if you are among the growing number of\ntourists and expatriates captivated by the beautiful Pacific coastline north\nof Puerto Vallarta, you do have something in common with\nsea turtles: a taste for pristine, undeveloped, remote beaches.\n</P>\n<P>\nUnfortunately, your needs and theirs may collide.\n</P>\n<P>\nThree species of turtle -- the Olive Ridley, Hawksbill and the\ncritically endangered Leatherback -- lay their eggs on the contiguous\nbeaches of Litibu, Malinal, Punta Negra and Careyeros, a two-mile\nstretch of rapidly developing white beach and rock outcrops in\nthe Mexican state of Nayarit.\n</P>\n<P>\nTwo years ago, expatriates living along those beaches began meeting over\npotlucks to talk about how to protect the natural turtle\nnursery. They've recently formalized a partnership with the nonprofit Grupo\nEcologico Manos Unidas por Litibu A.C (Litibu Ecology Group). With\nthe Mexican government's okay, expertise from biologists and backing from\nthe expatriates, the group operates a turtle corral where the\neggs can safely hatch.\n</P>\n<P>\n\"We want to establish the (nonprofit) before the hotels are developed,\nso that we can have some impact,\" said Susan Drexler-Price,\nan organizer of the grassroots homeowners group and former history\nteacher from Oakland, Calif. (Now, she runs the Pie in\nthe Sky bakeries in nearby Bucerias and Puerto Vallarta.)\n</P>\n<P>\nSea turtles face a host of threats around the world. They\nget tangled up in commercial fishing lines and nets. Pollution\nmakes them sick, literally. Some species are killed for meat,\nothers for their shells.\n</P>\n<P>\nIn Nayarit, poachers steal the eggs for their alleged aphrodisiac effects,\ngulping them raw with lime and chili. Poached eggs can\nfetch as much as 10 pesos apiece, says Gilberto Galindo\nCastro, president of the Litibu Ecology Group and a biologist.\nAt that price, a single nest containing about 100 eggs\nnets a poacher 1,000 pesos (about $90 U.S.). Compare that,\nhe says, to Mexico's minimum daily wage of 45 pesos.\nThe Mexican government takes poaching seriously, he continued, assessing steep\nfines or jail time -- \"it's a worse offense than\ndrugs\" -- but it lacks the manpower to prevent the\ncrime in the first place or prosecute offenders in the\nsecond.\n</P>\n<P>\nRapid development endangers the turtles, too. Tourists, and locals for that\nmatter, ride ATVs up and down the beach, potentially crushing\nthe eggs. (Drexler-Price once stopped some riders to try to\neducate them. \"So who are you?\" one asked her. \"The\nturtle bitch?\" She jokes that she's considered making up T-shirts\nwith the phrase.) Also, lights from mushrooming hotels and homes\nalong the beaches confuse the new hatchlings, which make their\nway to the ocean by following moonbeams reflecting off the\nwater. The longer it takes them to reach the ocean,\nthe slimmer their chances of ever getting there.\n</P>\n<P>\nDuring egg-laying season (June-December), volunteers from the Litibu Ecology Group, many\nof them university students, carefully move the eggs to the\ncorral, meticulously recording numbers and nest locations. When the eggs\nhatch, which happens en masse, the newborns scurry across the\nbeach to the sea. Volunteer Jamie Perkins says only one\nin 1,000 will survive to adulthood. Amazingly, eight to 10\nyears later, the female turtles return to their natal beach\nto lay their own eggs.\n</P>\n<P>\nEfforts in Mexico to protect sea turtles are a patchwork of\nofficial and unofficial endeavors, according to Sea Turtle, Inc., a\nnonprofit based in South Padre Island. In the 1960s, Galindo\nCastro remembers \"mucho, mucho\" turtles on this two-mile stretch. (Careyeros,\ntranslates as \"turtle hunter beach,\" indicating the turtles have come\nhere, and men have killed them, for quite some time).\nThen the government said it was okay to harvest them,\nand their numbers plummeted. When the government changed its mind\nand changed its policy beginning in 1990, Galindo Castro says\nthe numbers went up again. Since that about-face, SEMARNAT (Mexico's\nequivalent of our Environmental Protection Agency) has operated a corral\nin Nuevo Vallarta, about 10 miles from Litibu, last year\ngathering eggs from some 4,000 turtle nests to better the\nhatchlings' chances for survival. His own group hopes to relocate\neggs from 200 sea turtle nests in the coming season.\n</P>\n<P>\nThere are seven sea turtle species in the world. All are\nendangered, some, including the leatherback, critically. Why bother to save\nthem?\n</P>\n<P>\n\"Biologists could tell you we don't know exactly what could happen\n... if they become extinct, probably something dramatic,\" Jeff George\nof Sea Turtle Inc., said during a telephone interview. \"We\ncan't tell you exactly how (things) would fall apart, but\nwe know enough about their diet to theorize.\"\n</P>\n<P>\nHe gave a \"for instance.\" Some sea turtle species eat jellyfish\nlike they are going out of style. If the turtles\nweren't around to eat the jellyfish, the jellyfish population would\nexplode. The hungry jellyfish hordes, in turn, would gorge on\nzooplankton. That's bad, very bad, as plankton is vital for\nhealthy seas. Or suppose the sea turtle species that George\ndescribed as the \"lawnmower of the ocean\" went extinct. Its\ndietary habits ensure healthy seagrasses, where it just so happens\nfish lay eggs and shrimp spawn. Should those turtles disappear,\nit doesn't look so good for fish or shrimp, either.\nOr for us.\n</P>\n<P>\nSitting at a beachside restaurant not far from the nesting grounds\nshe dreams of protecting, nibbling on chips and sipping a\ncool drink, Drexler-Price, a layperson, sums up. \"Basically,\" she said,\n\"it's our future.\"\n</P>\n<P>\nTo learn more about the Litibu Ecology Group, or to make\na donation, access www.peacemexico.org and click \"Turtle Project\" under the\nbutton \"Get Involved.\"\n</P>\n",
