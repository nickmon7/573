				"The women, both mothers of two young children, bowed their heads, closed their eyes and whispered, ``Oh, God please bless the families who lost children,'' and they began to cry.",
				"``Please comfort them and be with them, and comfort the people of this town.",
				"Please comfort this town.'' Littleton needs comfort.",
				"Tuesday morning 12 Columbine High School students and a teacher were murdered when Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, also Columbine students, opened fire with at least four guns and dozens of bombs.",
				"The gunmen died in the massacre as well, apparently from self-inflicted gunshot wounds.",
				"Littleton needs comfort.",
				"Many looked for it Saturday morning on top of Mt.",
				"Columbine, a hill in Clement Park that borders the high school's baseball fields.",
				"The first few visitors climbed over slushy snow that melted quickly as the sun finally made an appearance after three days of snow.",
				"As the day progressed, the snow became thick mud and as many as 100 visitors at a time came to the top of the hill to look at the rough wood cross that had been staked into the ground there.",
				"They bent to leave flowers, poems, balloons and other mementos of grief at the base of the cross, then stood to gaze at the familiar town that seemed to look different after such a loss.",
				"Most of Littleton is visible from the top of Mt.",
				"Columbine _ the rows of roofs, the sidewalks, the strip malls and trash cans, the basketball backstops above garage doors.",
				"Physically, it's the same town it was Monday.",
				"But 15 of its own are gone, and the loss resonates deeply and profoundly.",
				"Many wonder what to do now.",
				"How do people experiencing grief and anger and confusion and intense sadness navigate the unfamiliar paths to peace?",
				"``I don't know,'' said Debbie Ellwanger, a 10-year Littleton resident.",
				"``Nobody knows where to go from here.",
				"I think we have to learn from this and not let those kids die in vain.'' She and her husband, Larry, trekked through the dirty snow up Mt.",
				"Columbine on Saturday, fingers laced together as they cried for the children.",
				"``They shouldn't have died,'' Larry Ellwanger said.",
				"His wife nodded: No, they shouldn't have died.",
				"So they came to the wood cross on top of Mt.",
				"Columbine to try making sense of something that never will.",
				"Below the hill, in the middle of the baseball field, someone had built 13 small snowmen in an even circle.",
				"Some cannot forgive Klebold and Harris, and possibly never will.",
				"On top of Mt.",
				"Columbine, though, people thought more about healing and pulling together and getting through.",
				"``All we can do is come together,'' said Carrie Goertz, 16.",
				"``It's just something that all the barriers have been broken and people have to accept and take care of each other.",
				"There's always going to be differences between people, but we've got to look past that, the exterior stuff, and just be together, be unified.'' ``And we've got to take advantage of our time with our family and friends,'' Aimee Jensen, 18, added quietly.",
				"The tragedy at Columbine has brought unity that for now is unbreakable _ it has reached around the world and drawn in the thoughts and prayers of people far removed from suburban Colorado.",
				"The memorials in Clement Park testify to the depth of grief that those who didn't lose loved ones in the massacre feel.",
				"They bring cards and flowers, donate food and building materials, thinking about how impossibly sad it is when people _ particularly children _ die without reason, about what they would have done if it had happened to someone they love, about the people suffering most.",
				"One card written by a boy named Mark hung on a larger memorial sign and said: ``Dear Columbine, I hope you feel better.'' The tragedy has forced huge issues to an overburdened spotlight: guns, youth violence, school safety, cliques and disaffected youth, community togetherness, peace.",
				"Hopefully they are issues that will not be forgotten when time passes.",
				"But for now, for the next several weeks, people seem able only to get through the worst of it, to handle the realization that some people are not coming back and that yes, things like this do happen here.",
				"And that somehow, life keeps moving.",
				"``That's the strange things,'' said Aaron Burningham, 27, looking out across Littleton from the top of Mt.",
				"Columbine.",
				"``It seems like life should stop, but it doesn't.'' Story Filed By Cox Newspapers For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service"

				"(AP) -- They streamed in from all over -- hand-lettered signs and cards and bouquets by the hundreds, aimed at comforting a town torn asunder.",
				"One good wish, soaked by the morning rain, was signed, simply, ``Your community.'' But what community was it from?",
				"So many forms of community, rippling outward from Columbine High and across the planet, have come together since last week's violence that it was difficult to tell.",
				"In an age when so many Americans regularly lament the breakdown of community, the many communities that the Columbine massacre has produced are proving that the notion, at least in time of crisis, still thrives.",
				"``Jefferson County has 500,000 residents, but today our community is much larger,'' county commissioner Patricia Holloway said Sunday at a shopping-center parking lot service attended by 70,000 people -- a hastily stitched-together community unto itself.",
				"There are the communities that existed already, like Columbine students and Columbine Valley residents.",
				"There are myriad mini-communities created by the bloodshed: Denver-area students, their rivalries suddenly rendered irrelevant; emergency personnel, united in their harrowing experiences; towns like Jonesboro and Paducah and Springfield and Edinboro, who understand Columbine's anguish but never asked to be members of this kind of community.",
				"The list continues onward, outward -- beyond metropolitan Denver, past President Clinton and his prayers, as far as the president of the West African nation of Ghana, who counted himself among the community of Littleton mourners and said ``something must be done to stop this thing.'' The response is most visible in metropolitan Denver, radiating outward from the high school and adjacent Clement Park, which has become a mourner's Lourdes.",
				"Fast-food restaurants are flying flags at half-staff and posting sympathy signs.",
				"Businesses are contributing goods and raising funds.",
				"Denver's newscasters have donned blue Columbine ribbons.",
				"Big-league sports teams canceled games in deference; Mile High Stadium now sports a giant Columbine ribbon visible from Interstate 25.",
				"Hugs have become a greeting of choice -- even, sometimes, between strangers.",
				"``We get so busy in our everyday lives and we're so self-sufficient that we think we don't need the help of our community,'' said Marny Danneberg, a volunteer dispensing hot drinks and food from a Red Cross truck near the high school since Tuesday.",
				"``It's when something like this happens that we realize the community's there for us,'' she said Sunday.",
				"After the shootings, messages and contributions of support came in from across the nation, from towns and individuals that repeatedly reassured mourners that they were ``part of a larger community.'' Folks from Elgin, Ill., drove a giant banner of support into town.",
				"Kids by the busload came from towns across the West to share grief.",
				"In Seaside Heights, N.J., 1,800 miles away, Mayor P.",
				"Kenneth Kershey scheduled a candlelight vigil on an Atlantic Ocean beach as ``a clear demonstration of the nationwide caring for the people of Littleton.'' What unifies regions this way?",
				"A national culture, for one -- the very mass media that many blame for fomenting the violence.",
				"Instantaneous news delivery unites people in shock and grief, creating a virtual community of TV viewers and another of Internet users that didn't exist 40 years ago.",
				"Thus, people who don't know each other can mourn together.",
				"``The entire nation is a community of shock, of love and of grief,'' Vice President Al Gore said Sunday.",
				"``One of the hidden truths of the human condition is that suffering binds us together.'' In Littleton (literally ``Little Town''), an affluent town of 35,000 at the foot of the Rockies, the fresh bonding of its existing communities and the birth of so many new ones are serving as salves for recuperation.",
				"Residents say the area around Columbine in the Southern Platte River Valley has been a tight-knit community for 26 years, since the high school opened on an undeveloped patch of prairie and houses sprouted up around it.",
				"This was long before the retail sprawl unfurled from the north to connect Columbine to Denver and make the area a suburb.",
				"``A community formed around that high school, and the school grew as the community grew,'' said Gerry Difford, who opened Columbine in 1973 and was principal for its first two years.",
				"``It has a sound community base to it that's somewhat unusual for a suburban high school.'' Today, though a few patches of open prairie remain, houses continue to sprout.",
				"And the families that have streamed into Denver's suburbs in recent years have, some say, created a populace unfamiliar with its neighbors -- one hungry for the coming-together that the Columbine deaths caused.",
				"``Disaster brings out the best of us, not the worst.",
				"People may not know each other, but when disaster hits that doesn't matter.",
				"We knock on the neighbor's door and talk about it,'' says Robert R.",
				"Butterworth, a psychologist who studies both child trauma and how people cope with public tragedy.",
				"``That sense of reaching out makes us feel better.'' That reaching out resonates nationally and globally as people sew together crisis bonds that wouldn't otherwise exist.",
				"Now, as the event recedes and coping begins, some are hoping that perhaps, this time, the unity allegedly caused by two angry boys' violent acts can last.",
				"``If they would have known the revival they have started, they never would have done what they did,'' said Phyllis Cain, whose daughter, Mickey, attends Columbine.",
				"``They wanted death and destruction.",
				"Instead, we've all come together.''"

				"LITTLETON, Colo.",
				"(AP) -- Comforting each other with ceremony and song, Columbine High School's mourners turned a strip-mall parking lot into an arena of grief and promised each other they would reach past their pain.",
				"Vice President Al Gore brought the 70,000 heartbroken people a message Sunday: ``You are not alone.'' Investigators, spending the day at the memorial service, were to resume their work this morning, conducting more interviews and eyeing the possibility of additional suspects in Tuesday's massacre.",
				"Of the 12 students slain, three were to be laid to rest today.",
				"A funeral also was scheduled for Dave Sanders, a popular teacher hailed as a hero for shepherding students to safety during the attack.",
				"Sunday's outdoor ceremony was a mass catharsis at the foot of the snow-capped Rockies.",
				"People hugged and wept as a parade of students, singers and public officials tried to make sense of the week's events.",
				"Many wore Columbine clothing; everything in sight -- even portable toilets -- was festooned with blue Columbine memorial ribbons.",
				"``Behind you, scarred but still standing, is Columbine High School,'' Gov.",
				"Bill Owens said.",
				"``One thing is clear: This community will not be beaten.'' Christian singer Amy Grant began a tribute song to the victims with a gentle lament: ``So much pain and no reason why.'' Bagpipe players played ``Amazing Grace'' and four F-16 jets flew over in a ``missing-man'' formation after 13 doves were released -- one for each victim.",
				"Brothers Jonathan and Stephen Cohen sang a tribute they wrote.",
				"Jonathan Cohen, a junior, was trapped in the Columbine choir room when gunfire erupted.",
				"Stephen, a senior, was in the cafeteria where many students were shot or hit by shrapnel from pipe bombs.",
				"``Can you still hear raging guns ending dreams of precious ones?'' they sang.",
				"``In God's son, hope will come, his red stain will take our pain.'' Columbine Principal Frank DeAngelis called the gathering ``the end of a nightmare.'' Religious leaders urged trust in God.",
				"And Gore, thundering like a preacher at a revival, underscored that bloodshed like that allegedly caused by Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris must remain an aberration.",
				"``The young killers of Columbine High School do not stand for the spirit of America,'' Gore said.",
				"``America is a good and decent place, and our goodness is a light to all the nations of the world.'' The pair, enraged by what they considered taunts and insults from classmates, allegedly rampaged through their school with guns and bombs before turning their weapons on themselves.",
				"Investigators, amazed at the sheer firepower, are trying to determine if others were involved.",
				"Police have found a diary plotting the mayhem in precise detail, as well as bomb-making materials and weapons in one of the pair's bedroom.",
				"More interviews were set for this week; more than 500 have already been conducted.",
				"Deputies suspended their investigation and media briefings for the day, concentrating on directing traffic for the shopping-center ceremony.",
				"At times, the service took on the flavor of a somber pep rally.",
				"Senior Amber Burgess, after eulogizing Sanders, urged the crowd to persevere and invoked school spirit.",
				"``We are!'' she yelled.",
				"``Columbine!'' thousands replied.",
				"Then the proceedings moved en masse to Clement Park, adjacent to Columbine and -- as long as the school remains cordoned off -- the mourning place of choice and site of a vast makeshift memorial.",
				"Hundreds lined the procession route.",
				"``I always knew this school was very strong and this is a good community, and all the kids love each other.",
				"But to see the kids and the community come together was just amazing,'' said Scott Rathbun, a senior.",
				"Nick Foss, 18, grazed by a bullet while helping teachers and students hide in a closet and overhead air ducts, limped behind Gore and was supported by DeAngelis.",
				"Mourners applauded as they passed, and Littleton firefighters walked beside Foss, patting him on the back.",
				"``God Bless you guys!'' a man shouted.",
				"``You've got a reason to live.'' On Sunday evening, some 1,300 friends and family gathered at a church to remember Daniel Mauser, 15, and Kelly Fleming, 16.",
				"He was a cross-country runner who had recently returned from a two-week trip to Paris with the French club; she was an aspiring songwriter and author eager to get her driver's license.",
				"The victims' families held the dual funeral because they belong to neighboring churches of the same Roman Catholic archdiocese.",
				"Jefferson County school officials said Columbine's 1,800 students would return to classes Thursday a few miles south at Chatfield High School, a school originally built to accommodate Columbine's overflow.",
				"Columbine's graduation ceremony will be held May 22 at Fiddler's Green, a suburban amphitheater normally used for rock concerts -- one baby step toward normalcy -- and in defiance of the gunmen.",
				"``They wanted death and destruction.",
				"Instead, we've all come together,'' said Phyllis Cain, whose daughter, Mickey, attends Columbine.",
				"``They can't kill the message.",
				"They can't kill the hope.''"

				"The gathering, held in a movie theater parking lot under threatening skies, commemorated 12 students and one teacher killed Tuesday when two gunmen burst into the Jefferson County school wielding guns and bombs.",

				"Gov.",
				"Bill Owens acted as master of ceremonies during the 75-minute memorial service that included speeches from Archbishop Charles Chaput, and Franklin Graham, the son of evangelist Billy Graham.",
				"Singers Amy Grant and Michael Smith joined a large bagpipe band in providing music for the crowd, joining two Columbine students who wrote a song in honor of their fallen classmates.",
				"In the crowd were people who had driven hundreds of miles to pay their respects.",
				"``It's something that can help us personally by coming and seeing and sharing the hurt and the pain.",
				"It's just something that struck my heart,'' said Tim Weitzel, who with his wife, Donna, drove from Grand Junction to attend the service.",
				"Owens extended his sympathy to the families of the slain and wounded, some of whom gathered in front of the crowd, while the archbishop told them that ``love is stronger than death.'' ``Confronted with an unimaginable evil, this community has grown closer,'' Owens said.",
				"The nation and the world have joined in grieving for the students of Columbine, Gore said.",
				"He asked the crowd ``to feel the embrace of hundreds of millions.'' ``One of the hidden truths of the human condition is that suffering binds us together,'' Gore said.",
				"``Here in Jefferson County, the spring has yielded to the cold winter of the heart.'' Gore asked that the shootings serve as a wake-up call for parents and schools.",
				"Decrying the violence and cruelty of pop culture, Gore said parents must cushion their children against hate.",
				"``If you are a parent, your children need your attention,'' Gore said.",
				"``If you are a grandparent, they need your time.'' It's too easy for children to get guns, and schools must focus on discipline in teaching character, he added.",
				"In his only comment that addressed the killers, Gore called for forgiveness.",
				"``We must have the courage not to look away, either in life or in death, from those who feel despised or hated,'' he said.",
				"Harris and Klebold, who authorities say planned the massacre for more than a year, have been portrayed by classmates as outcasts from the popular students at Columbine.",
				"The suspects were not mentioned by name during the service, although Chaput also asked they be forgiven.",
				"Graham praised the Columbine community for uniting under the pain of a tragedy that could have torn it apart.",
				"He seized the opportunity to chastise public schools for being empty of ``the teachings of God.'' ``They are indeed dangerous places,'' Graham said.",
				"Owens closed the memorial by reciting the names of the 12 students and one teacher killed and releasing a white dove for each, as many in the crowd wept and light rain fell.",
				"It was a message of hope that was repeated throughout the day.",
				"``Love is stronger than death _ I believe that,'' Chaput said.",
