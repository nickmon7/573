                "Sheriff John Stone said Tuesday afternoon that there could be as many as 25 dead.", 
                "By early Wednesday, his deputies said the death toll was 15, including the two gunmen.", 
                "The discrepancy occurred because the SWAT teams that picked their way past bombs and bodies in an effort to secure building covered overlapping areas, said sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis.", 
                "``There were so many different SWAT teams in there, we were constantly getting different counts,'' Davis said.",

                "'' But what community was it from?", 
                "So many forms of community, rippling outward from Columbine High and across the planet, have come together since last week's violence that it was difficult to tell.", 
                "In an age when so many Americans regularly lament the breakdown of community, the many communities that the Columbine massacre has produced are proving that the notion, at least in time of crisis, still thrives.", 
                "``Jefferson County has 500,000 residents, but today our community is much larger,'' county commissioner Patricia Holloway said Sunday at a shopping-center parking lot service attended by 70,000 people -- a hastily stitched-together community unto itself.", 
                "There are the communities that existed already, like Columbine students and Columbine Valley residents.", 
                "There are myriad mini-communities created by the bloodshed: Denver-area students, their rivalries suddenly rendered irrelevant; emergency personnel, united in their harrowing experiences; towns like Jonesboro and Paducah and Springfield and Edinboro, who understand Columbine's anguish but never asked to be members of this kind of community.", 
                "The list continues onward, outward -- beyond metropolitan Denver, past President Clinton and his prayers, as far as the president of the West African nation of Ghana, who counted himself among the community of Littleton mourners and said ``something must be done to stop this thing.", 
                "'' The response is most visible in metropolitan Denver, radiating outward from the high school and adjacent Clement Park, which has become a mourner's Lourdes.",

                "Hugs have become a greeting of choice -- even, sometimes, between strangers.", 
                "``We get so busy in our everyday lives and we're so self-sufficient that we think we don't need the help of our community,'' said Marny Danneberg, a volunteer dispensing hot drinks and food from a Red Cross truck near the high school since Tuesday.", 
                "``It's when something like this happens that we realize the community's there for us,'' she said Sunday.",

                "This was long before the retail sprawl unfurled from the north to connect Columbine to Denver and make the area a suburb.", 
                "``A community formed around that high school, and the school grew as the community grew,'' said Gerry Difford, who opened Columbine in 1973 and was principal for its first two years.",

                "And the families that have streamed into Denver's suburbs in recent years have, some say, created a populace unfamiliar with its neighbors -- one hungry for the coming-together that the Columbine deaths caused.",

                "People may not know each other, but when disaster hits that doesn't matter.", 
                "We knock on the neighbor's door and talk about it,'' says Robert R. Butterworth, a psychologist who studies both child trauma and how people cope with public tragedy.",

                "``All of us must change our lives to honor these children,'' said Gore, in a forceful speech filled with religious references less than a mile from the site of the worst school killing in U.S. history.", 
                "The gathering, held in a movie theater parking lot under threatening skies, commemorated 12 students and one teacher killed Tuesday when two gunmen burst into the Jefferson County school wielding guns and bombs.",

                "Singers Amy Grant and Michael Smith joined a large bagpipe band in providing music for the crowd, joining two Columbine students who wrote a song in honor of their fallen classmates.",

                "``It's something that can help us personally by coming and seeing and sharing the hurt and the pain.",

                "Owens extended his sympathy to the families of the slain and wounded, some of whom gathered in front of the crowd, while the archbishop told them that ``love is stronger than death.",
