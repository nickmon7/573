				"Carroll moved to his right and continued firing, and Murphy and Boss, who were closer to the car, began firing as well, they said.",
				"Several of the officers are said to have told associates that they continued firing because Diallo did not fall even after they had unleashed the fusillade.",

In the two months since Diallo was killed, 1,203 people have been arrested in demonstrations over Diallo's death, the alleged police torture of Haitian immigrant Abner Louima in 1997 and the perception that law-abiding minorities are routinely humiliated by police stop-and-search tactics.",
				"Off-duty police officers and more than 25 of Diallo's friends and relatives packed the small courtroom for the 45-minute arraignment.",
				"About 1,000 demonstrators stood outside the courthouse.",
				"Since the slaying, the street-crime unit has been ordered to wear uniforms instead of plainclothes, and 50 slots at the predominantly white division will be reassigned to minority police officers.",
				"The case also reflects tension over police attitudes and tactics nationally.",
				"Earlier this month, President Clinton said he was worried that recent charges of police misconduct could undermine the fight against crime.",
				"The officers in the Diallo case did not testify before the grand jury.",
				"Brounstein and Culleton both said their clients began firing because they saw one officer on the ground.",
				"McMellon supposedly slipped and fell as he and the other officers confronted Diallo.",
				"James Culleton, Murphy's lawyer, said his client ``had a sick feeling inside of him, believing that he was going to be shot, and he reacted.'' Earlier Wednesday, Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Safir attended a tribute to a police officer killed in the line of duty in 1996.",
				"Safir called Diallo's death a tragedy but urged critics of the Police Department to ``acknowledge the tragedies that befall our family.'' ``We grieve for Amadou Diallo and the four officers involved and pray they get a fair trial,'' Safir said."

			"headline":"FOUR N.Y. OFFICERS INDICTED IN SHOOTING OF AFRICAN IMMIGRANT",
			"sentences":[
				"NEW YORK _ The Rev.",
				"Al Sharpton stepped to the microphone outside the Bronx County Couthouse and bellowed: ``The police in there have just been charged with murder in the second degree,'' and the crowd of hundreds whooped and cheered.",
				"It was the first time ever that a New York City police officer has been indicted for murder, according to prosecutors and police spokesmen, though a few have faced manslaughter charges.",
				"The three-count indictment _ two for second-degree murder, one for reckless endangerment _ applied to all four of the white officers who fired 41 bullets at African immigrant Amadou Diallo in the wee hours of Feb.",
				"4, as he stood, unarmed, in the vestibule of his Bronx apartment building.",
				"The officers _ Kenneth Boss, Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon, and Richard Murphy _ pleaded not guilty to the charges.",
				"State Supreme Court Judge John P.",
				"Collins set bail at $100,000 for each officer, which was expected to be met.",
				"Police commissioner Howard Safir suspended the officers from the force immediately after announcement of the indictment, which was returned by a grand jury last week but officially unsealed just Wednesday.",
				"What happens next could intensify, rather than quell, the racial tensions that have been simmering in the two months since the shooting.",
				"Wednesday's indictment coincided with the start of jury selection in the trial of the five officers in Brooklyn who were indicted in last year's torture and sodomy, inside a stationhouse bathroom, of Haitian immigrant Abner Louima.",
				"The Louima trial, too, is bound to be perceived _ and treated _ as a showcase of the dark underbelly of the N.Y.P.D.",
				"Potential jurors have been instructed to fill out a 42-page questionnaire, asking 128 questions, such as ``Do you think there is a prospect of social unrest following a verdict in this case?'' and ``Have you ever been exposed to persons who show, or who have shown, racial, sexual, religious, or ethnic prejudice?'' and ``How would you rate the job the New York City Police Department is doing in dealing with crime?'' The Diallo case has spawned three official investigations _ by the US Justice Department, federal prosecutors, and the New York state attorney general _ into a possible pattern of racial discrimination in the department's practices.",
				"Meanwhile, some police are shouting back.",
				"A few hundred off-duty officers rallied outside the Bronx courthouse Wednesday, as well, some shouting, ``No justice, no police'' _ a threatening play on Sharpton's chant, ``No justice, no peace.'' Inside the courtroom, though, the atmosphere was solemn.",
				"The four officers, wearing suits, sat stonefaced.",
				"Among the spectators, on one side of the aisle were Diallo's parents, who had flown in from Guinea for the occasion, along with friens and relatives.",
				"On the other side were friends of the officers.",
				"There were no outbursts.",
				"Diallo's mother, Kadiadou Diallo, had tears in her eyes.",
				"Later in the day, lawyer Johnnie Cochran, who is representing Diallo's parents, announced he will sue the city for civil damages, saying, ``We will be relentless in our pursuit of justice.'' The Diallo shooting has set off the largest protests the city has seen in years _ and cast a serious blemish on the pride of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's five years as mayor.",
				"Crime has dramatically declined, with murders down by over 70 percent, to the lowest point since the early 1960s.",
				"But many people are now wondering if the social cost _ white officers behaving too aggressively and intrusively in minority neighborhoods _ might be too high.",
				"In a 15 days leading up to Wednesday's indictment, 1,203 people _ including prominent officials, lawyers and other professionals of all races and religions _ were arrested in Sharpton-led civil-disobedience protests outside police department headquarters.",
				"Those protests are now over, but Sharpton promised Wednesday, ``We will keep on marching, we will keep the pressure on.'' Lawyers on both sides Wednesday offered previews of the cases they will argue when the trial starts April 30.",
				"Bronx District Attorney Robert Johnson noted New York law does not require him to prove premeditation on the part of the four officers.",
				"Rather, he need only show that they shot Diallo ``with intent to cause'' Diallo's death, acted with ``a depraved indifference to human life,'' and ``did recklessly engage in conduct which created a grave risk of death.'' The defense lawyers called their clients ``political prisoners,'' and said they would show the incident was ``a tragedy, not a crime,'' because the officers had ``reasonable'' cause to believe Diallo was reaching for a gun when they fired.",
				"One lawyer said his client, Richard Murphy, did not fire until he saw McMellon fall.",
				"McMellon had slipped on the sidewalk, but Murphy thought, his lawyer said, that he had been shot."

				"NEW YORK (AP) -- The cheering began as the parents of Amadou Diallo left the prosecutor's office.",
				"Black bystanders fell in behind the couple Wednesday as they marched two blocks to a courthouse where four white police officers pleaded innocent to murder charges in the shooting death of the Diallos' son, a 22-year-old street vendor from Guinea with no criminal record.",
				"The officers heard cheers, too -- from scores of their off-duty colleagues, most of them white.",
				"``On Feb.",
				"4, in the vestibule in his own building, Amadou Diallo stood blameless, unarmed and defenseless when 19 of 41 shots were fired at him, struck him and killed him,'' prosecutor Robert Johnson told the court.",
				"``These four defendants intended to take his life.'' The case has inspired a painful examination of police attitudes and tactics across the nation.",
				"Earlier this month, President Clinton said he was worried that recent charges of police misconduct could undermine the fight against crime.",
				"More than 1,200 people have been arrested in the city in demonstrations since Diallo was cut down in the fusillade.",
				"Many of the protesters -- white and black, celebrities and common folk -- also demonstrated against the alleged police torture of Haitian immigrant Abner Louima in 1997 and the feeling that law-abiding minorities are routinely humiliated by police stop-and-search tactics.",
				"``Amadou's blood will feed the battle for justice,'' his mother, Kadiadou Diallo, told 1,000 supporters outside the courthouse.",
				"The Rev.",
				"Jesse Jackson, who was arrested at a Feb.",
				"19 rally protesting the Diallo killing, praised prosecutors for taking what he called ``the first step in the pursuit of justice'' but added that ``justice will not prevail until the officers are punished for the crime.'' ``Even under duress,'' Jackson said, ``those who are called to uphold the law must be held at a higher standard.'' The killing has frayed Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's already tense relationship with New York's black community.",
				"Many have accused him of failing to understand the depth of New Yorkers' anger over the incident.",
				"Giuliani declined to comment on the charges, but said earlier in the day: ``We should allow the criminal justice system to now operate.",
				"...",
				"Now you move to another stage in which the crime has to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.'' Officers Kenneth Boss, Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon and Richard Murphy -- who were searching for a rape suspect and fired apparently believing Diallo had a gun -- showed little emotion when the charges were read.",
				"Each was indicted on two counts of second-degree murder and one count of reckless endangerment.",
				"They could get 25 years to life in prison on the murder charges.",
				"Judge John Collins set bail at $100,000 for each officer, although Johnson had asked that they be held without bail.",
				"The officers were immediately suspended from the force.",
				"They had been on desk duty.",
				"Marvyn Kornberg, Carroll's lawyer, called the murder count ``ludicrous.'' ``What's the district attorney saying, that they had nothing to do that night but roll up on an individual and attempt to kill him because he's black?'' he asked.",
				"Lawyers for the four officers spoke separately in court, offering the first glimpse of the defense account of what went wrong the night they confronted Diallo outside his Bronx apartment building.",
				"James Culleton, Murphy's lawyer, said his client ``had a sick feeling inside of him, believing that he was going to be shot, and he reacted.'' Culleton and Steven Brounstein, Boss's attorney, said their clients fired because they saw an officer on the ground.",
				"McMellon reportedly slipped and fell as the officers confronted Diallo.",
				"Boss ``believed there was a fire fight was going on,'' Brounstein said.",
				"At a news conference, Johnson criticized the officers for choosing not to testify before the grand jury which voted last week to indict them.",
				"``Having exercised that right, they cannot then say, `We're police officers, therefore what we did was OK,''' he said.",
				"``Without explanation, what we have is four people driving up to a location, pulling out their guns and killing an individual.'' The Rev.",
				"Al Sharpton, who organized daily protests against the shooting, praised the grand jury's action.",
				"``We can only say that it is appropriate that these policemen have been indicted for murder,'' he said.",
				"Diallo's father would only say, ``I'm very happy.'' Since the shooting, New York's street-crime unit has been ordered to wear uniforms instead of plainclothes, and 50 slots at the predominantly white division will be reassigned to minority police officers.",
				"Earlier Wednesday, Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Safir attended an emotional tribute to a cop killed in the line of duty in 1996.",
				"Safir called Diallo's death a tragedy but urged NYPD critics to ``acknowledge the tragedies that befall our family.'' ``We grieve for Amadou Diallo and the four officers involved and pray they get a fair trial,'' Safir said."

				"_ The FBI dispatched a team of ballistic experts from Washington who spent days making measurements of the crime scene and traced bullet trajectories with lasers.",
				"_ Defense lawyers have employed their own set of crime-scene specialists who may be called to rebut whatever theories the prosecution's experts propose.",
				"_ The Diallo family has employed a pathologist whose autopsy has led to charges by their lawyers that the West African immigrant was shot repeatedly, even after he had collapsed, paralyzed, from his initial wounds.",
				"``The forensic evidence is critical to the case because it is the forensic evidence that offers the best challenge to the credibility of the four police officers,'' said Peter Neufeld, a lawyer for the Diallo family, which is planning to bring a civil suit in the case.",
				"``You can question their story based on common sense and logic and what passersby might have seen or heard.",
				"But none of that can be as devastating an impeachment as objective, irrefutable scientific evidence.'' Not surprisingly, the officers' lawyers embrace the same irrefutable science to argue a opposite position.",
				"``I am not afraid of the forensic evidence,'' said Stephen Worth, the attorney for Officer Edward McMellon, one of the four accused of second-degree murder.",
				"``What the forensic evidence will not show is that these officers fired repeatedly into a prone body.",
				"Quite the contrary, I expect it to show the opposite, that, namely, the vast majority of the shots, if not all of the shots, were fired at a standing person.'' Of course, it is far from certain that a verdict in the case will hinge on forensic evidence.",
				"Assuming the officers testify, their credibility in asserting that they feared for their lives in the mistaken belief that Diallo was armed could also be a decisive factor.",
				"But it seems likely that a dizzying parade of expert witnesses will take the stand at the trial to debate the trigonometric calculation of bullet trajectories, and more importantly, to contradict one another.",
				"``Ideally, the physical evidence should support one conclusion,'' said Peter R.",
				"De Forest, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice.",
				"``But what often happens is that one side or the other pays someone to dispute it and the science gets polluted.'' The Bronx district attorney's office has declined to comment on details of the evidence or how it might be used in the trial.",
				"But the Diallo family lawyers have shown no such reticence, virtually constructing a criminal case against the officers while preparing the civil suit.",
				"One of the central disputes will likely focus on the officers' assertion that Diallo continued to stand upright, even after he had been hit by many of the 19 bullets that struck him.",
				"There are apparently no eyewitnesses to confirm or rebut that account, although several of Diallo's neighbors on Wheeler Avenue have said they saw a portion of the incident and heard the shooting.",
				"But the Diallo family's lawyers dismissed the officers' version as ``absurd,'' pointing to an autopsy by their pathologist, Dr.",
				"Cyril H.",
				"Wecht of Pennsylvania, that suggests that Diallo was knocked down and paralyzed quite early in the barrage.",
				"``Amadou Diallo was already on the ground with his spinal cord severed,'' said the Rev.",
				"Al Sharpton, a family adviser, ``so the alibi they have put on the court record will devastate the defense.'' The official autopsy by the city Medical Examiner's office does not discuss the sequence of shots, the position of Diallo's body when he was hit or whether he was paralyzed at any point, people who have reviewed the report have said.",
				"The autopsy report does indicate that two shots, one from the front and one from the back, perforated Diallo's spine at separate points.",
				"Those perforations are the primary basis for the family's conclusion that he was paralyzed.",
				"Wecht's analysis that those shots came early in the sequence is based, in part, on the amount of blood from those wounds that filled his chest cavity.",
				"But Marvyn Kornberg, who represents Officer Sean Carroll, said the officers' semiautomatic weapons fired so fast that it is impossible to determine with any precision when the shots to the chest were fired.",
				"``You are talking about a matter of eight seconds,'' he said.",
				"``You can't tell which is first and which is second.",
				"Any medical examiner who testifies to that can expect some rigorous cross examination.'' A second set of bullets that struck Diallo's right leg and foot also figure to be a source of debate.",
				"The city's autopsy indicates that one shot struck Diallo just above the heel and traveled up the calf before lodging behind the knee, people who reviewed the report have said.",
				"The Diallo family's lawyers believe this bullet, as well as a second bullet that the autopsy says hit Diallo's middle toe ``adjacent to the front of the nail,'' indicate that Diallo was shot after he had fallen.",
				"Defense lawyers dispute that conclusion and argue that the incident took so little time that the officers most likely had no chance to gauge the impact of their initial shots as they fired subsequent rounds.",
				"There could also be a dispute over just how much time elapsed as the 41 shots were fired, especially since witnesses have said they heard a pause in the firing, apparently caused when Officer Edward McMellon fell down while firing."

				"29, when she would decide all motions.",
				"While the trial date would come nearly a year after Diallo's death on the night of Feb.",
				"4, it is not unusual in such high-publicity cases.",
				"Defense lawyers are usually pleased by delays to the extent that they can temper bad publicity about the case, which they see as possibly prejudicial to their clients.",
				"But if the delay was welcome, there were still Kornberg's efforts to force Worth, the official lawyer for the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, off the case.",
				"Kornberg said later that if Worth was not disqualified, Kornberg might push for a separate trial for Carroll.",
				"The issue of severing the cases is important because the defendants will probably need one another's testimony to corroborate their accounts of the shooting.",
				"For example, the defense has suggested that the 41 shots fired at Diallo _ a number that has become a flash point in the case _ were precipitated by one of the officers yelling ``Gun!'' and another falling down some steps as if he had been shot."
