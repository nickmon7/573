				"Experts with the Shaanxi Provincial Wildlife Management Station confirmed that the dung was left by an adult giant panda.",

A total of 273 wild giant pandas have been spotted in an area of 347,864 hectares, which officials say means there are 7.8 pandas on per 100 sq km, the highest density among all pandas' habitats in China.",
				"Wang said, Shaanxi has so far established 13 giant pandas protection zones and nature reserves focused on pandas' habitats.",
				"Giant pandas are said to have been around during the time of dinosaurs and regarded as a \"national gem\" of China. About 1,590 giant pandas are still at large in the wild, mostly in the high mountains around Sichuan Basin, and 160 live in captivity.",
				"The central and provincial governments have invested 160 million yuan (nearly 20 million US dollars) into panda protection programs since 1992. China built its first natural preserve for giant pandas and began to ban poaching in the 1950s. The pandas have been put under state protection in the past four decades since 1962. "
