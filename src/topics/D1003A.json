				"On Dec. 14 last year, Feng Shiliang, a farmer from Youfangzui  Village, told the Fengxian County Wildlife Management Station that he had spotted an animal that looked very much like a giant panda  and had seen giant panda dung while collecting bamboo leaves on a  local mountain.",
				"Experts with the Shaanxi Provincial Wildlife Management Station confirmed that the dung was left by an adult giant panda.",
				"They ascribed the appearance of giant pandas in Fengxian County, located on the western section of Qinling Mountain, a major  habitat for giant pandas, to the local government's strenuous  efforts to restore and protect natural forest resources in the  region over recent years.",
				"Giant pandas used to live in Fengxian County before the 1970s  but later disappeared from the area owing to the construction of  the railway from Baoqi in Shaanxi to the capital city of Chengdu  in southwestern Sichuan province.",

				"The third national survey on giant pandas, which began in 2000  and ended last year, shows that pandas live in mountain areas of  20 towns of eight counties along the east-west Qinling Mountain in Shaanxi Province. A total of 273 wild giant pandas have been  spotted in an area of 347,864 hectares, which officials say means  there are 7.8 pandas on per 100 sq km, the highest density among  all pandas' habitats in China.",
				"Wang said, Shaanxi has so far established 13 giant pandas  protection zones and nature reserves focused on pandas' habitats.",
				"Giant pandas are said to have been around during the time of  dinosaurs and regarded as a "national gem" of China. About 1,590  giant pandas are still at large in the wild, mostly in the high  mountains around Sichuan Basin, and 160 live in captivity.",
				"The central and provincial governments have invested 160  million yuan (nearly 20 million US dollars) into panda protection  programs since 1992. China built its first natural preserve for  giant pandas and began to ban poaching in the 1950s. The pandas  have been put under state protection in the past four decades  since 1962."
