                " CANBERRA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The Papua New Guinea (PNG) Defense Force, the police and health services are on standby to help the victims of a tsunami that wiped out several villages, killing scores of people, on PNG's remote north-west coast Friday night.", 
                "\"Prime Minister Bill Skate has directed that immediate action be taken to arrange urgent supplies of food, water, shelter and cooking utensils while detailed assessments and reports are being prepared,\" Robert Igara, chief secretary of the PNG government, said Saturday in a statement, Australian Associated Press reported.", 
                "Igara said the PNG Red Cross had confirmed arrangements to provide food supplies and authorities had asked the Australian High Commission in Port Moresby for immediate air transport support.", 
                "The death toll so far from the tsunami that struck the coastline near the town of Aitape in the West Sepik (Sandaun) province Friday night, was officially announced 64 and many more people were missing.", 
                "Igara said reports so far indicated that a community school, government station, Catholic mission station and the Nimas village in the Sissano area west of Aitape had been completely destroyed, where 30 people were dead.", 
                "And Warapu village had also been completely destroyed, with 11 confirmed deaths and many missing.", 
                "Sixteen people in the devastated Arop village were confirmed dead, and two children had died in the Malalo village, which was wiped out.", 
                "Another five people died in the Teles-Lambu villages.", 
                "Igara said the population in the area affected by the tsunami was 8,000 to 10,000 people.", 
                "\"Officers are now visiting the affected villages and areas to establish the whereabouts, safety and health of the population,\" he said.", 
                "Meanwhile, Prime Minister Bill Skate, National Disaster Services Chairman Colin Travertz and National Disaster Services Director-General Ludwig Kembu were reported to inspect the affected areas Sunday. "

                " CANBERRA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Australia Sunday sent three Air Force C130 Hercules aircraft loaded with medical and food supplies on an urgent mission to help survivors of a devastating tsunami which struck Papua New Guinea (PNG) Friday night.", 
                "The tidal wave smashed into the northwestern coastline near the town of Aitape in West Sepik province, killing at least 600 people, according to reports reaching here.", 
                "Australian Defense Minister Ian McLachlan told reporters in Adelaide that Australia's aid agency, AusAid, estimated the final toll would be well over 1,000, with many thousands injured and as many as 6,000 left homeless.", 
                "Two Hercules aircraft left the Richmond airforce base, north-west of Sydney, in the afternoon, while another plane took off from Townsville.", 
                "The planes were due to arrive Sunday night and fly out to the devastated region Monday morning.", 
                "McLachlan said the aircraft were ferrying 60 medical personnel with the aim of setting up a mobile hospital in the area.", 
                "However, he said that how quickly the medical crew could get to work would depend on whether the landing strip at Wanimo was long enough for the C130s to land and the possibility of further earthquakes.", 
                "\"It's very rough terrain and our problem is finding an area we can land and get in our equipment,\" he was quoted by the Australian Associated Press as saying.", 
                "Defense ministry spokesman Colonel Keith Jobson said that even when the planes touched down at the airstrip, the defense personnel would still have to use helicopters or road transport to access the stricken villages.", 
                "Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer described the events in PNG as \"horrific\", saying Australia would do all it could to help PNG cope with the crisis.", 
                "\"We'll be further liaising with the Papua New Guinea government to provide realistic help in those circumstances,\" he said. "
