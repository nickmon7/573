				"Two Hercules aircraft left the Richmond airforce base, north-west of Sydney, in the afternoon, while another plane took off from Townsville. The planes were due to arrive Sunday night and fly out to the devastated region Monday morning.",
				"McLachlan said the aircraft were ferrying 60 medical personnel with the aim of setting up a mobile hospital in the area. However, he said that how quickly the medical crew could get to work would depend on whether the landing strip at Wanimo was long enough for the C130s to land and the possibility of further earthquakes.",
				""It's very rough terrain and our problem is finding an area we can land and get in our equipment," he was quoted by the Australian Associated Press as saying.",
				"Defense ministry spokesman Colonel Keith Jobson said that even when the planes touched down at the airstrip, the defense personnel would still have to use helicopters or road transport to access the stricken villages.",
				"Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer described the events in PNG as "horrific", saying Australia would do all it could to help PNG cope with the crisis.",
				""We'll be further liaising with the Papua New Guinea government to provide realistic help in those circumstances," he said."
