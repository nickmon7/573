				"A new robotic microscope that follows a brain cell in the lab from a normal state to its death has led researchers to a surprising finding that appears to debunk a long-standing theory about Huntington's disease.",
				"Like many degenerative brain diseases, including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, proteins targeted in the disease process begin misfolding and clumping in or around brain cells, which are called neurons.",
				"It has long been thought that the sticky protein triggers the death of brain cells.",
				"But Dr.",
				"Steve Finkbeiner and colleagues at the University of California in San Francisco and the university's Gladstone Institute of Neurological Disease have discovered that the mutant protein that clumps inside the brain cells of Huntington's patients actually saves cells from dying.",
				"``This process appears to be protective,'' said Finkbeiner, an assistant professor in the department of neurology and physiology.",
				"Today, a major treatment strategy is aimed at developing medicines to stop this abnormal protein from clumping.",
				"If Finkbeiner is right, this could worsen matters.",
				"``This has been an area of great controversy,'' said Dr.",
				"Christopher Ross, a professor at Johns Hopkins Medical Institutes in Baltimore.",
				"``It's an important finding.'' The study will be published Thursday in Nature.",
				"While proteins that cause Alzheimer's and Parkinson's are different, the pathology -- these deposits in or around brain cells -- is similar.",
				"A few years ago Finkbeiner and colleagues published a paper in the journal Cell showing that when these protein clumps, called inclusion bodies, disappear, neurons got worse.",
				"He decided to build a microscope that would allow scientists to follow brain cells over a long period, akin to videotaping a neuron's life.",
				"In the experiment, they took neurons from the striatum, the brain region hard hit by Huntington's.",
				"In a lab dish, they added either the normal Huntington gene, or the mutant form that causes the disease.",
				"``Inclusion-body formation actually prolonged survival and protected neurons,'' Dr.",
				"Harry Orr of the Institute of Human Genetics at the University of Minnesota wrote in an accompanying editorial.",
				"He said the scientific approach could serve the field well.",
				"Some scientists now think the vulnerable neurons sweep the abnormal protein ``to get it out of the way,'' explained Hopkins' Ross.",
				"Normally, neurons have enzymes that actually work like garbage disposals to get rid of material floating around a cell.",
				"But in this case, it's more like a recycling bin.",
				"The problem, Ross said, ``is that no one ever comes to pick up the garbage.'' Huntington's is an inherited, fatally degenerative disease of the central nervous system that appears on average at age 35.",

			"sentences":[
				"A new medical study helps explain the puzzling effect of the hormone dopamine on patients suffering from the degenerative nerve disorder Parkinson's disease, said a report out Thursday.",
				"Doctors have been aware that dopamine levels worsen performance in some cognitive tasks while improving performance in others, without knowing why.",
				"Parkinson's patients, when off their dopamine-increasing medications, learn better from negative feedback, such as being scolded, the study said.",
				"And they learn less from positive feedback, such as being praised, than do healthy people of the same age and intelligence.",
				"The study was published in the current issue of the journal Science.",
				"\"When these same Parkinson's patients take their dopamine medication, they show the reverse pattern, learning better from positive feedback and worse from negative feedback than controls,\" said the University of Colorado research team.",
				"\"Dopamine is a brain chemical associated with feelings of pleasure and reward that is thought to contribute to learning through both positive and negative feedback,\" said the report.",
				"\"Loss of dopamine leads to the symptoms of Parkinson's.",
				"This work may also extend beyond Parkinson's to address the neurobiology of learning from experience: learning that occurs when positive feedback or rewards reinforce behavior and negative feedback causes people to avoid such behavior,\" it said.",
				"The research also identified a group of brain receptors in mice that appear to be responsible for nicotine addiction.",
				"\"These findings may help scientists find targets for drugs aimed to help smokers kick their habit,\" said the report.",
				"\"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are expressed in the brain structures thought to be involved in the addiction to smoking.",
				"\"These receptors, which are embedded in the surfaces of neurons, can be composed of different combinations of subunits ...",
				"Mice with a mutation in the 'alpha4' subunit were unusually sensitive to the effects of nicotine.\""
