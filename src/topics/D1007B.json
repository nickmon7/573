                "At least seven staff who had contact with the victims were experiencing flu-like symptoms, but it was not clear if they had also contracted the H5N1 strain, local health officials said today.", 
                "Investigators fanned out across the territory Monday, checking poultry farms for traces of the disease amid the speculation that it could have been passed to humans by chickens.", 
                "All hospitals and clinics in Hong Kong have been ordered to test patients for the flu.", 
                "A number of the patients' relatives were also found developing flu-like symptoms and were undergoing tests.", 
                "A three-year-old boy and a man died earlier this year after catching the \"bird flu\", or H5N1 strain of influenza, and a 13-year-old girl is in hospital with the disease.", 
                "Another victim, a two-year-old boy, who was hospitalized with fever in November, later fully recovered.", 
                "World Health Organization (WHO) officials in Geneva said leading researchers would this week decide whether a vaccine should be developed, according to reports reaching here. "

                " HONG KONG, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) set up an inter-department working group today to coordinate efforts towards the prevention and control of the spread of a mysterious \"bird flu\" that has killed two people.", 
                "A SAR government spokesman said the group, which comprises representatives from various government departments, will hold its first meeting Tuesday.", 
                "The group will coordinate measures necessary for the prevention and control of the \"bird flu,\" or H5N1 virus, the spokesman said.", 
                "Chickens have been identified as the most likely source of a new strain of the flu.", 
                "The move came after three more people were suspected last week to have been stricken with the H5NI virus, bringing the number of confirmed or suspected cases to seven.", 
                "A 5-year-old child died in May in the first known case of a human contracting the virus.", 
                "A 54-year-old man died early this month, and a 2-year-old boy recovered after hospitalization in November.", 
                "Three more people remained hospitalized.", 
                "The government also announced today that authorities in the neighboring Guangdong Province have agreed to step up the monitoring of chicken diseases at farms there.", 
                "A statement said Guangdong also plans to restrict chicken exports to Hong Kong.", 
                "Experts say they are baffled by the virus, and the hospital authority has issued guidelines to the public and hospitals to treat the potentially deadly flu.", 
                "There has been no evidence of human-to-human transmission of the virus, and no infected chickens have been found at the market, according to a source from the local health department.", 
                "Three more experts from the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta in the United States arrived in Hong Kong Thursday to help in the investigation, the source said.", 
                "The World Health Organization has reportedly been asked to alert vaccine production centers worldwide to follow developments with a view to preparing the necessary vaccine. "

                " HONG KONG, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The bird flu in Hong Kong, which has killed two people, has not become an epidemic, a local senior health official said today.", 
                "Speaking at a news conference here, Director of the Health Department of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Margaret Chan said that the SAR government would take \"a number of preventive measures to protect public health.", 
                "\" \"The present cluster of cases detected in Hong Kong has not reached epidemic proportions,\" she said.", 
                "\"The efficiency of transmission from human to human should not be high or there should be hundreds and thousands of such cases in the SAR by now, according to past experience with other types of influenza,\" she added.", 
                "However, \"the transmission of the virus both from bird to human and human to human is possible,\" Chan said.", 
                "She stated that the SAR health authority has been working very closely with the World Health Organization and the Centers for Diseases Control in the United States in dealing with the investigation and study of this new strain of influenza A H5N1 virus.", 
                "For the public, she advised that the best way to combat influenza infection is to build up body resistance by having a proper diet with adequate exercise and rest.", 
                "\"Good ventilation should be maintained,\" she said, urging the public to maintain good personal hygiene.", 
                "Chan told reporters that initial assessment made by a Special Working Group on Influenza A H5N1 noted an association with poultry in some of the cases under investigation.", 
                "The inter-department Special Working Group was set up yesterday to coordinate efforts toward the prevention and control of the spread of the mysterious bird flu after three more people were suspected last week of having been infected with the H5NI virus, bringing the number of confirmed or suspected cases to seven.", 
                "A 5-year-old child died in May in the first known case of a human contracting the virus.", 
                "A 54-year-old succumbed to the virus early this month, but a 2-year-old boy recovered after hospitalization in November.", 
                "Three more people remain hospitalized for the illness.", 
                "Moreover, two more cases were classified as \"suspected\" by the Department of Health, increasing to nine the total number of H5N1 cases in human, Chan said. "
