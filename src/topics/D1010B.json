It warned that at least 500 other patients may have been exposed to the disease if they came into contact with surgical instruments used on the patient.",

"Although we cannot guarantee your risk of an exposure is absolutely zero, it is immeasurably lower, for example, than other types of potential infections that sometimes occur in a hospital or other clinical surgical settings," he said."
