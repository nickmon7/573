                " An appetite-curbing hormone that failed to live up to its early buzz as a possible key to slowing obesity is now being probed as a potential aid for women who suffer from infertility and eating disorders.", 
                "\"This represents essentially a new era for leptin,\" said Dr. Jean Chan, one of the researchers exploring new uses for the hormone.", 
                "\"Now that we understand so much more about what this hormone does, we can target it appropriately for the right condition.", 
                "\" A very small study, led by researchers at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and at Massachusetts General Hospital and published recently in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that leptin restored menstrual periods in a few female athletes who hadn't had periods for an average of 5 1/2 years.", 
                "Authors of the study also said there were some preliminary signs that the hormone improved bone density, which begins to decline when women stop menstruating.", 
                "Women with low body fat, including athletes and those with eating disorders, often stop menstruating, developing a condition called hypothalamic amenorrhea.", 
                "The condition, caused by the way the brain regulates the reproductive system, can also affect some women who are overly thin.", 
                "Doctors believe some of those cases are caused by stress.", 
                "But in others, they believe it may be caused by subtler changes in body composition caused by diet and exercise.", 
                "The new work on leptin may offer clues to the condition's cause.", 
                "One function of leptin, which was discovered in 1994, is to regulate appetite.", 
                "It was originally thought that increasing leptin might suppress the appetites of obese people.", 
                "But studies found heavy people tended to have plenty of leptin and adding more didn't help.", 
                "Researchers in the new study, which was funded by institutional grants and Amgen, the developer of a drug based on the hormone, began looking at people who may not have enough leptin because of low body fat.", 
                "The researchers gave injections of Amgen's synthetic leptin to eight competitive women athletes, all with hypothalamic amenorrhea.", 
                "The injections raised the women's leptin levels to those of normal women or higher.", 
                "Treatment was given until they responded or up to three months, whichever came first.", 
                "(One woman dropped out of the study.", 
                ") Five of the remaining seven showed promising results, according to the study.", 
                "Three of the women, one of whom had not had a period in 14 years, ovulated and had menstrual bleeding.", 
                "Two others were \"for all intents and purposes about to ovulate,\" Chan said.", 
                "Researchers said they envisioned possible fertility treatments, help for thin athletes at risk of bone fractures, and restoration of menstruation to patients recovering from anorexia.", 
                "Dr. Barbara Corkey, president of the North American Association for the Study of Obesity and a professor of medicine and biochemistry at Boston University, said the study had found a \"creative use of leptin,\" but she wasn't surprised.", 
                "\"Leptin doesn't have only one function,\" she said.", 
                "\"It serves another function and this highlights that.", 
                "\" Dr. William Schlaff, president of the Society for Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility and a professor at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center in Denver, said the study was \"very nicely designed\" and had made an \"important first observation\" that needed further study.", 
                "Ultimately, he speculated, it could lead to advances that would help infertile women.", 
                "Dr. Rexford Ahima, at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine's Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, said the study suggested that leptin is the signal that links fat tissue to the brain and instructs it to control menstruation.", 
                "Ahima agreed that leptin might have potential as a fertility treatment.", 
                "But he had questions about its use as a treatment for eating disorders, noting that anorexia is primarily a psychiatric disorder whose root cause should be addressed before leptin is considered.", 
                "Chan, at the Beth Israel medical center, said researchers are already planning a longer study of a larger group of women. "

                "CREDIT: Robert Holst/NYTRNG (with sidebar 2BINGEEATING) Binge eating gets a closer look New study tests drug that curbs overeaters' urge The temptation to overeat will strike most of us during the holiday season, but for those who suffer from a binge-eating disorder, holiday feasting can be self-inflicted hell.", 
                "Binge eating disorder is a newly recognized condition that probably affects millions of Americans.", 
                "Those with the disorder frequently eat large amounts of food while feeling at a loss to control their eating.", 
                "To date, there are no approved medications to treat binge-eating disorder, but a large, multi-center study may offer hope to the 2 percent of the population who suffer from it.", 
                "Dr. Nathan Shapira, an assistant professor of psychiatry of the University of Florida's College of Medicine, is among the researchers testing the effectiveness of topiramate, a drug developed to treat the convulsions and seizures of epilepsy, in controlling binge eating.", 
                "Shapira said that when topiramate was used for epilepsy patients, many reported that they also had a marked decrease in appetite and even lost weight.", 
                "A small study of some 60 patients with binge eating disorder showed that those who received the topiramate rather than a placebo binged less often and also lost weight.", 
                "The new study will test the effectiveness of topiramate in 350 binge eaters from around the country, Shapira said.", 
                "Results are anticipated next year.", 
                "It is funded by Ortho McNeil Pharmaceutical, which makes the drug.", 
                "Binge eating disorder, Shapira emphasizes, is not the same as indulging in an occasional binge at the table or \"grazing\" through an array of buffet offerings.", 
                "\"Everyone probably binges at some point, particularly during 'sanctioned' events like Thanksgiving dinner,\" Shapira said.", 
                "\"The real difference between 'grazing' and binge eating is eating much more than normal in a short period of time, often less than two hours.", 
                "\"It's a terrible situation to be surrounded by food when that's all that you are thinking about,\" he said.", 
                "After a binge, he said, binge eaters feel disgusted with themselves.", 
                "As a result, they often eat alone or very rapidly, and will eat until they are uncomfortably full.", 
                "Unlike eating disorders such as bulimia nervosa or anorexia where victims are predominantly female, the ratio of female to male binge eaters is about 3-to-2.", 
                "It is common in all ethnic groups.", 
                "Almost all who have this disorder are either overweight or obese.", 
                "It has been estimated that up to 30 percent of those in weight-loss programs have a binge-eating disorder.", 
                "They usually develop a weight problem earlier in life and do not do as well in these programs.", 
                "One study looking at Overeaters Anonymous found that 70 percent of the members had a binge eating disorder, Shapira said.", 
                "The major complications of binge eating disorder are the diseases that accompany obesity.", 
                "These include diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, gallbladder disease, heart disease and certain types of cancer.", 
                "The causes of the disorder are still unknown, but up to half of all people with binge eating disorder have a history of depression.", 
                "Whether depression is a cause or effect is unclear, according to the National Institutes of Health.", 
                "Many people report that anger, sadness, boredom, anxiety or other negative emotions can trigger a binge episode.", 
                "\"There's a lack of recognition that this disorder is very common and treatable,\" Shapira said.", 
                "For those who think they might have an eating problem, he suggests two questions: Do you eat a lot of food in a short period?", 
                "Do you feel out of control as you do so?", 
                "Those who answer \"yes\" to both should consider whether they have a binge-eating disorder.",

                "Because no laboratory tests or other objective criteria exist for making psychiatric diagnoses, the American Psychiatric Association's manual is the definitive arbiter of the line between normal and abnormal.", 
                "Its definitions help determine such practical matters as insurance reimbursement, competence and eligibility for disability.", 
                "But they also help determine something more elusive, and probably more important: whether someone's behavior should be considered a personality quirk or a symptom of mental illness.",

                "But if it turns out that the characteristics of those who binge and vomit once a week are similar to those who do so twice a week, then we can loosen the criteria for bulimia nervosa.",

                "Anorexia nervosa first appeared in the version of the manual published in 1980, and bulimia appeared for the first time in the same edition.", 
                "Bulimia was renamed bulimia nervosa in the next edition, which came out in 1987.", 
                "Anorexia nervosa affects 0.5 to 3.7 percent -- or about 1.5 million to 11 million American women -- at some point in life, according to the National Institute of Mental Health.",

                "In the current version of the diagnostic manual, published in 1994, one condition -- binge eating disorder -- was pulled out of EDNOS and listed as a \"provisional diagnostic category,\" the first step in the process of achieving its own diagnosis.", 
                "The disorder is much like bulimia nervosa, but without the purging.", 
                "The \"provisional\" designation highlights the need for more research into a condition's prevalence and treatment, and highlighting binge eating disorder in this way was a prelude to its being named as a separate diagnosis in the manual that is to appear in 2012.", 
                "\"That's one of most compelling reasons to get something out of the Not Otherwise Specified category,\" said Dr. Michael First, associate professor of clinical psychiatry at Columbia.",

                "\"If you feel that there's a homogeneous group of patients in there for which there's a treatment, the fact that it's called Not Otherwise Specified really obscures it, hindering treatment, hindering research,\" he said.", 
                "Another candidate for a new eating disorder in the fifth edition of the manual can be thought of as the flip side of binge eating, a condition that has been labeled \"purging disorder\" by Dr. Pamela Keel, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Iowa.",

                "People with purging disorder, Keel said, are of normal weight, and they purge after eating normal or even small amounts of food.", 
                "Right now, purging disorder is relatively hidden, buried in the EDNOS category.", 
                "And until the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual panelists ask for more data, as they have for binge eating disorder, not much more will be known, Keel said.", 
                "\"Within widely used diagnostic interviews, if a person has never had a low weight and denies a history of binge eating, the interviewer skips all questions regarding the use of vomiting, laxatives or diuretics to control weight,\" Keel wrote in an e-mail message.",

                "\"The whole belief that diagnoses are useful things rests on their ability to put together under one umbrella a relatively homogeneous set of syndromes, which gives the clinician the ability to shortcut a full assessment.",

                "\" But she expressed concern that the term would limit the enthusiasm for teasing out what other identifiable conditions lie within the EDNOS category.", 
                "As experts debate what to do about EDNOS -- pull out distinct disorders from the grab bag category, change the diagnostic criteria for the existing disorder, give the grab bag a more scientific-sounding name -- people with disordered eating are left in a kind of therapeutic limbo.",
