                "An appetite-curbing hormone that failed to live up to its early buzz as a possible key to slowing obesity is now being probed as a potential aid for women who suffer from infertility and eating disorders.", 
                "\"This represents essentially a new era for leptin,\" said Dr. Jean Chan, one of the researchers exploring new uses for the hormone.", 
                "\"Now that we understand so much more about what this hormone does, we can target it appropriately for the right condition.", 
                "\" A very small study, led by researchers at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and at Massachusetts General Hospital and published recently in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that leptin restored menstrual periods in a few female athletes who hadn't had periods for an average of 5 1/2 years.", 
                "Authors of the study also said there were some preliminary signs that the hormone improved bone density, which begins to decline when women stop menstruating.", 
                "Women with low body fat, including athletes and those with eating disorders, often stop menstruating, developing a condition called hypothalamic amenorrhea.", 
                "The condition, caused by the way the brain regulates the reproductive system, can also affect some women who are overly thin.", 
                "Doctors believe some of those cases are caused by stress.", 
                "But in others, they believe it may be caused by subtler changes in body composition caused by diet and exercise.", 
                "The new work on leptin may offer clues to the condition's cause.", 
                "One function of leptin, which was discovered in 1994, is to regulate appetite.", 
                "It was originally thought that increasing leptin might suppress the appetites of obese people.", 
                "But studies found heavy people tended to have plenty of leptin and adding more didn't help.", 
                "Researchers in the new study, which was funded by institutional grants and Amgen, the developer of a drug based on the hormone, began looking at people who may not have enough leptin because of low body fat.", 
                "The researchers gave injections of Amgen's synthetic leptin to eight competitive women athletes, all with hypothalamic amenorrhea.", 
                "The injections raised the women's leptin levels to those of normal women or higher.", 
                "Treatment was given until they responded or up to three months, whichever came first.", 
                "(One woman dropped out of the study.", 
                ") Five of the remaining seven showed promising results, according to the study.", 
                "Three of the women, one of whom had not had a period in 14 years, ovulated and had menstrual bleeding.", 
                "Two others were \"for all intents and purposes about to ovulate,\" Chan said.", 
                "Researchers said they envisioned possible fertility treatments, help for thin athletes at risk of bone fractures, and restoration of menstruation to patients recovering from anorexia.", 
                "Dr. Barbara Corkey, president of the North American Association for the Study of Obesity and a professor of medicine and biochemistry at Boston University, said the study had found a \"creative use of leptin,\" but she wasn't surprised.", 
                "\"Leptin doesn't have only one function,\" she said.", 
                "\"It serves another function and this highlights that.", 
                "\" Dr. William Schlaff, president of the Society for Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility and a professor at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center in Denver, said the study was \"very nicely designed\" and had made an \"important first observation\" that needed further study.", 
                "Ultimately, he speculated, it could lead to advances that would help infertile women.", 
                "Dr. Rexford Ahima, at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine's Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, said the study suggested that leptin is the signal that links fat tissue to the brain and instructs it to control menstruation.", 
                "Ahima agreed that leptin might have potential as a fertility treatment.", 
                "But he had questions about its use as a treatment for eating disorders, noting that anorexia is primarily a psychiatric disorder whose root cause should be addressed before leptin is considered.", 
                "Chan, at the Beth Israel medical center, said researchers are already planning a longer study of a larger group of women."

                "CREDIT: Robert Holst/NYTRNG (with sidebar 2BINGEEATING) Binge eating gets a closer look New study tests drug that curbs overeaters' urge The temptation to overeat will strike most of us during the holiday season, but for those who suffer from a binge-eating disorder, holiday feasting can be self-inflicted hell.", 
                "Binge eating disorder is a newly recognized condition that probably affects millions of Americans.", 
                "Those with the disorder frequently eat large amounts of food while feeling at a loss to control their eating.", 
                "To date, there are no approved medications to treat binge-eating disorder, but a large, multi-center study may offer hope to the 2 percent of the population who suffer from it.", 
                "Dr. Nathan Shapira, an assistant professor of psychiatry of the University of Florida's College of Medicine, is among the researchers testing the effectiveness of topiramate, a drug developed to treat the convulsions and seizures of epilepsy, in controlling binge eating.", 
                "Shapira said that when topiramate was used for epilepsy patients, many reported that they also had a marked decrease in appetite and even lost weight.", 
                "A small study of some 60 patients with binge eating disorder showed that those who received the topiramate rather than a placebo binged less often and also lost weight.", 
                "The new study will test the effectiveness of topiramate in 350 binge eaters from around the country, Shapira said.", 
                "Results are anticipated next year.", 
                "It is funded by Ortho McNeil Pharmaceutical, which makes the drug.", 
                "Binge eating disorder, Shapira emphasizes, is not the same as indulging in an occasional binge at the table or \"grazing\" through an array of buffet offerings.", 
                "\"Everyone probably binges at some point, particularly during 'sanctioned' events like Thanksgiving dinner,\" Shapira said.", 
                "\"The real difference between 'grazing' and binge eating is eating much more than normal in a short period of time, often less than two hours.",

                "After a binge, he said, binge eaters feel disgusted with themselves.", 
                "As a result, they often eat alone or very rapidly, and will eat until they are uncomfortably full.", 
                "Unlike eating disorders such as bulimia nervosa or anorexia where victims are predominantly female, the ratio of female to male binge eaters is about 3-to-2.",

                "One study looking at Overeaters Anonymous found that 70 percent of the members had a binge eating disorder, Shapira said.",

                "Whether depression is a cause or effect is unclear, according to the National Institutes of Health.", 
                "Many people report that anger, sadness, boredom, anxiety or other negative emotions can trigger a binge episode.",

                "For those who think they might have an eating problem, he suggests two questions: Do you eat a lot of food in a short period?", 
                "Do you feel out of control as you do so?",

                "But purging is not always easy in her college dormitory, with four young women sharing a single bathroom, so she ends up vomiting, on average, about once a week.",

                "According to the bible of psychiatric diagnosis, the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual,anorexia must be accompanied by cessation of menstrual periods for at least three months in a row, and bulimia must involve vomiting or other forms of purging at least twice a week, on average.",

                "\"EDNOS right now is a real hodgepodge,\" said Dr. B. Timothy Walsh, professor of pediatric psychopharmacology at Columbia.", 
                "\"We have people in that category with anorexia nervosa,\" but they still menstruate so they don't meet all the criteria for a formal diagnosis.", 
                "Similarly, Walsh said, \"we have people who are obese and binge but don't vomit,\" so they don't fit into the strict definition of bulimia nervosa, which requires both binging and purging.", 
                "Or they might binge and vomit once a week, but to qualify as bulimic they would have to vomit at least twice a week.", 
                "\"What we really need to do is collect data,\" Walsh said.", 
                "\"All the knowledge base we currently have relates to people who vomit twice a week.", 
                "But if it turns out that the characteristics of those who binge and vomit once a week are similar to those who do so twice a week, then we can loosen the criteria for bulimia nervosa.", 
                "\" The history of eating disorders has been a gradual one as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual has been revised through the years.", 
                "Anorexia nervosa first appeared in the version of the manual published in 1980, and bulimia appeared for the first time in the same edition.", 
                "Bulimia was renamed bulimia nervosa in the next edition, which came out in 1987.", 
                "Anorexia nervosa affects 0.5 to 3.7 percent -- or about 1.5 million to 11 million American women -- at some point in life, according to the National Institute of Mental Health.", 
                "Rates are lower among men and teenage boys.", 
                "The lifetime prevalence of bulimia is higher -- from 1.1 to 4.2 percent of women -- with a similar age and sex distribution.", 
                "In the current version of the diagnostic manual, published in 1994, one condition -- binge eating disorder -- was pulled out of EDNOS and listed as a \"provisional diagnostic category,\" the first step in the process of achieving its own diagnosis.", 
                "The disorder is much like bulimia nervosa, but without the purging.", 
                "The \"provisional\" designation highlights the need for more research into a condition's prevalence and treatment, and highlighting binge eating disorder in this way was a prelude to its being named as a separate diagnosis in the manual that is to appear in 2012.", 
                "\"That's one of most compelling reasons to get something out of the Not Otherwise Specified category,\" said Dr. Michael First, associate professor of clinical psychiatry at Columbia.", 
                "First is a member of the planning group that is directing the enormous undertaking of revising the manual for its fifth edition.", 
                "\"If you feel that there's a homogeneous group of patients in there for which there's a treatment, the fact that it's called Not Otherwise Specified really obscures it, hindering treatment, hindering research,\" he said.", 
                "Another candidate for a new eating disorder in the fifth edition of the manual can be thought of as the flip side of binge eating, a condition that has been labeled \"purging disorder\" by Dr. Pamela Keel, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Iowa.", 
                "Just as binge eating disorder has many of the characteristics of bulimia, so does purging disorder.", 
                "But neither meets the strict criteria for bulimia nervosa.", 
                "People with purging disorder, Keel said, are of normal weight, and they purge after eating normal or even small amounts of food.", 
                "Right now, purging disorder is relatively hidden, buried in the EDNOS category.", 
                "And until the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual panelists ask for more data, as they have for binge eating disorder, not much more will be known, Keel said.", 
                "\"Within widely used diagnostic interviews, if a person has never had a low weight and denies a history of binge eating, the interviewer skips all questions regarding the use of vomiting, laxatives or diuretics to control weight,\" Keel wrote in an e-mail message.", 
                "\"It's very difficult to learn more about a problem if you never ask any questions about it.", 
                "\" (STORY CAN END HERE.", 
                ") As First sees it, several criteria must be met before a diagnosis is pulled out of the Not Otherwise Specified category and into a stand-alone diagnosis.", 
                "These criteria have to be met before binge eating disorder, purging disorder or any other condition emerges out of the EDNOS grab bag.", 
                "The first requirement is that a significant number of patients must be affected, he said.", 
                "Second, there has to be evidence of an existing and effective treatment.", 
                "The criterion of an effective treatment has prevented many conditions from being entered in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual.", 
                "In the 1980s, there was an effort to include \"sadistic personality disorder.", 
                "\" But it failed, said First, because no treatment existed.", 
                "\"We could have decided to call something sadistic personality disorder,\" he said, \"but if there's no treatment, what would be the point?", 
                "\" The third criterion for removing a condition from the Not Otherwise Specified category is the trickiest to meet.", 
                "It relates to a kind of diagnosis-creep.", 
                "Experts working on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual panels must ask how close the condition is to behavior that could be considered normal.", 
                "For binge eating disorder, for instance, they must ask: When is such behavior a true psychiatric condition, and when is it the kind of thing that almost everyone engages in every Thanksgiving?", 
                "\"This is the matter of what we call false positives,\" First said.", 
                "\"It's the danger of defining as a psychiatric syndrome a set of symptoms that normal people have.", 
                "\" When a new category is created in the manual, he said, \"you're trying to identify a category that will help patients get treatment.", 
                "\" \"But,\" he continued, \"you're worried that this category is going to be applied to normal people as well.", 
                "\" Some psychiatrists want to create a different label for EDNOS, calling it instead \"mixed eating disorder\" or \"atypical eating disorder.", 
                "\" But Walsh of Columbia said that would be merely a cosmetic change.", 
                "\"If I'm a clinician and I get a call from a school saying, 'Hey, I've got a person with mixed eating disorder coming over,' I don't know if I'm going to be seeing someone who weighs 80 pounds or 280 pounds,\" he said.", 
                "\"The whole belief that diagnoses are useful things rests on their ability to put together under one umbrella a relatively homogeneous set of syndromes, which gives the clinician the ability to shortcut a full assessment.", 
                "\" Diagnostic labels, said Walsh, \"allow big shortcuts.", 
                "\" Keel, on the other hand, prefers the term \"mixed eating disorder\" over EDNOS.", 
                "She said the mixed eating disorder label \"may have the benefit of eliminating the false impression that EDNOS is somehow less severe or less clinically significant than so-called full-threshold eating disorders.", 
                "\" But she expressed concern that the term would limit the enthusiasm for teasing out what other identifiable conditions lie within the EDNOS category.", 
                "As experts debate what to do about EDNOS -- pull out distinct disorders from the grab bag category, change the diagnostic criteria for the existing disorder, give the grab bag a more scientific-sounding name -- people with disordered eating are left in a kind of therapeutic limbo.", 
                "Eventually, the hope is, the uncertainties will be resolved, and the woman with anorexia who still menstruates and the woman with bulimia who only purges once a week, will be able to get the diagnosis and treatment that they need."
