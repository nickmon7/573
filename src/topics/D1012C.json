                "High in the skies above the Aegean Sea, two Greek fighter pilots nudged their F-16s to either side of a Cypriot passenger jet and quickly discerned the disaster that was unfolding.", 
                "They saw a cockpit in turmoil.", 
                "One of the Cypriot pilots sat slumped over the instrument panel.", 
                "The other was not visible at all.", 
                "Two other people desperately tried to gain control of the plane.", 
                "Oxygen masks dangled in the cabin.", 
                "Less than an hour later, Helios Airways Flight 522 bound for Athens slammed into the side of a wooded Greek hill Sunday, killing all 121 people aboard.", 
                "About one-third of the dead were children.", 
                "The worst airline crash in Greek history is also one of the most mysterious.", 
                "Incapacitation of both pilots on a commercial jetliner is extremely rare.", 
                "It suggests multiple malfunctions that happened either too quickly or too subtly for the pilots to be aware of them or to act in time to remedy them, aviation experts said.", 
                "Greek and Cypriot officials said Sunday that, while nothing could be ruled out, it appeared unlikely that terrorism was involved.", 
                "In addition, there were no signs of a hijacking, such as a distress call, the officials said.", 
                "``We have no indication whatsoever that this was a terrorist act,'' Cypriot Transport Minister Harris Thrassou said in a televised news conference at the Lanarca Airport, where the flight originated.", 
                "Instead, the leading theory about what went wrong on the Boeing 737 was a catastrophic loss of cabin pressure that would have starved the pilots and passengers of oxygen.", 
                "One pilot reportedly had complained of trouble with the plane's air-conditioning system early in the flight.", 
                "At altitudes above 30,000 feet, a sudden decompression could plunge the temperature inside the plane below zero, and those aboard could begin to experience hypoxia and loss of consciousness within 10 to 30 seconds unless they were able to put on emergency oxygen masks, aviation experts say.", 
                "The F-16s intercepted the Helios flight at 34,000 feet, officials said.", 
                "If this is what happened, it still does not explain how or why these systems failed, and whether the pilots were alerted by alarms that are standard equipment on jetliners.", 
                "Most of the people on board may have been dead or unconscious for the last hour or so that the plane traveled, on automatic pilot, until crashing, a civil aviation official in Athens said.", 
                "The two who entered the cockpit to attempt to control the plane may have been crew or passengers, a government official said.", 
                "Their identity was not clear, nor how long they were able to sustain their efforts.", 
                "The decompression scenario was reminiscent of the 1999 crash that killed U.S. golfer Payne Stewart, whose plane flew for nearly five hours after a sudden loss of cabin pressure killed or disabled all on board.", 
                "With its windows iced over, the plane finally plummeted into a field in South Dakota.", 
                "But that aircraft was a small Learjet, not a commercial airliner, which has numerous back-up systems.", 
                "``Although there are precedents for both pilots losing consciousness, for it to happen on a large airliner like a Boeing 737 with all the back-up systems they have does seem to be really quite extraordinary,'' Kieran Daly, editor of Air Transport Intelligence, said in an interview with CNN.", 
                "``If the crew had any indication at all of any problem (with air systems) they would immediately be on very robust emergency systems.", 
                "How that did not happen (with the Helios flight) is extremely strange.", 
                "'' Sudden loss of cabin pressure would trigger a loud horn and caution lights, said John J. Nance, an air safety analyst and former Air Force and commercial pilot.", 
                "``You're not going to miss this anyway because you're ears are going to start popping,'' he said.", 
                "``There's a lot here that doesn't make sense,'' said Nance, who added: ``Provided the information from the fighter pilot is right, then we have a high, high probability that we had a malfunctioning crew oxygen system, that the crew didn't know it in time.", 
                "'' He noted that drop-down oxygen masks provided in the passenger cabin are not powerful enough to sustain consciousness for very long.", 
                "It also was unclear whether why the Helios plane eventually lost altitude and crashed; one possibility was that it ran out of fuel.", 
                "In Sunday's crash, scorched debris, suitcases and bodies were scattered down the side of a hill and across a ravine 25 miles north of Athens.", 
                "A piece of the tail and a wheel from the landing gear were intact and recognizable.", 
                "The impact ignited fires in the dry brush.", 
                "One report from the scene said some of the bodies were wearing orange oxygen masks.", 
                "A man who said his cousin was on board reported receiving a mobile telephone text message from him shortly before the crash, saying the captain had ``turned blue'' and temperatures in the cabin had plummeted.", 
                "''Cousin farewell, we're freezing,`` the passenger messaged, according to Alpha TV, a Greek network.", 
                "The authenticity of the message could not be verified, but the description would be in keeping with drastic loss of cabin pressure.", 
                "By Sunday afternoon, rescue workers at the site of the crash had recovered the so-called black boxes that contain recordings of flight data and the pilots' voices, said Akrivos Tsolakis, head of the Greek airline safety commission.", 
                "At airports in Lanarca, Athens and Prague, the flight's final destination, distraught families spent long hours with little information and rising anxiety.", 
                "Especially at Lanarca, angry relatives blasted Helios for providing information too slowly and scuffled with police while trying to storm the airline's offices.", 
                "The dead included 48 Greek Cypriot children and youths on a holiday school trip to Prague, a spokesman for Helios said.", 
                "Most of the passengers and crew were Greek Cypriot, the spokesman said.", 
                "A Boeing Co. spokeswoman said the company had dispatched a team of experts to join the investigation.", 
                "The plane that went down was manufactured seven years ago and delivered to Helios in April 2004.", 
                "Shortly after takeoff Sunday morning, the Helios pilot radioed to ground control in Lanarca that he was having trouble with the air conditioning, Greek officials said.", 
                "That was the last contact.", 
                "The plane crossed into Greek airspace about half an hour later, around 9:30 a.m. Athens air traffic controllers began attempting to contact the plane at 10:07 a.m. to initiate landing procedures, but received no response.", 
                "The attempts continued until 10:55, when the lack of communication triggered Greek emergency procedures known as ''renegade alert``: the Greek air force scrambled two F-16 fighters to escort the plane to its landing.", 
                "The F-16 pilots, flanking the Helios aircraft, saw an unconscious co-pilot and no captain in the cockpit, Greek government spokesman Theodoros Roussopoulos said in a briefing for reporters in Athens.", 
                "They noticed that the oxygen masks had deployed inside the cabin and, a few minutes later, saw two people enter the cockpit to attempt to gain control of the doomed flight, Roussopoulos said.", 
                "The presence of these two was especially mysterious, since by all appearances most of the other occupants of Flight 522 were incapacitated.", 
                "''When a pilot has no communication with the control tower, the procedure dictates that other planes must accompany and help the plane land,`` Thrassou, the Cypriot transport minister, said.", 
                "''Unfortunately, it appeared that the pilot was already dead, as was, possibly, everyone else on the plane.`` Times staff writer Elizabeth Douglass in Los Angeles contributed to this report."

                "Greek Defense Ministry and fire department said that the plane crashed to a mountain at about 12:20 p.m. (0920 GMT) near the coastal town of Grammatikos, about 40 kilometers north of Athens, just a few minutes before its scheduled landing time on a flight from Larnaca International Airport of Cyprus to Prague via Athens.", 
                "Police and firefighters at the crash site reportedly said there were no immediate signs of survivors.", 
                "Among the passengers on the flight were 48 children, said a spokesman for Helios Airways quoted by Athens News Agency.", 
                "Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis cut short a long holiday weekend and called an emergency mini-cabinet meeting.", 
                "He called Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos by telephone and expressed his condolences.", 
                "Reports said that crew notified Cypriot authorities of a fault in the aircraft's air conditioning unit on approaching Greek airspace, but made no contact with Greek air traffic controllers on entry.", 
                "Greek civil aviation authorities alerted the air force in line with anti-terrorism measures.", 
                "Two F-16 fighter jets sent from a military base in Crete located the aircraft a few minutes later in the southern Aegean, but calls for identification went unheeded and the plane appeared to be out of control, reports said.", 
                "Flying at close quarters, air force officers reported that the aircraft's co-pilot appeared to have collapsed over his controls but no captain was visible through the cockpit window.", 
                "Overhead oxygen masks in the cabin section had dropped into place.", 
                "After reporting the aircraft as \"renegade\", or unidentified, the pilots tracked the airliner at about 38,000 feet until it began to lose height and crashed sparking a blaze.", 
                "Firefighters and rescue workers sped to the wreckage as military helicopters patrolled overhead.", 
                "Through scenes aired by Greek television stations, plane wreckage was scattered widely about the mountain.", 
                "\"The most likely thing is that a technical fault was involved, but we are looking into all possible causes and details.", 
                "It would not be responsible to say anything yet about the cause of the descent,\" said Greek Government Spokesman Theodoros Roussopoulos.", 
                "Reports also disclosed that passengers aboard the flight had sent text messages to relatives complaining of an \"Artic chill\" in the cabin with people starting to turn blue from the cold.", 
                "However, Greek media and Cypriot President's spokesman Marios Karogian said that terrorism had been ruled out in the incident on the basis of collected information."

                "The Cypriot airliner that crashed Sunday in Greece, killing all 121 people on board, may have experienced a catastrophic loss of cabin pressure that rapidly starved the pilots of oxygen, aviation experts said.", 
                "The co-pilot of the Helios Airways flight from Larnaca, Cyprus, was slumped over the controls and the captain was not in the cockpit, the Greek air force said after sending two F-16 jets to intercept the airliner after it failed to respond to radio calls.", 
                "Oxygen masks were seen hanging in the cabin, a Greek government spokesman said.", 
                "\"If the aircraft lost cabin pressure, either in the cockpit or the cabin, effectively everybody would be doomed within a short space of time,\" said Chris Yates, an aviation analyst at Jane's Transport.", 
                "\"If the aircraft went into depressurization very quickly you only have a few seconds before you lose consciousness because you don't have any air to breathe at that altitude,\" Yates said.", 
                "Airplane cabins are pressurized so that the air remains breathable even at very high altitudes.", 
                "If a plane suffers a loss of air pressure, the crew typically has enough warning to try to get to a lower altitude.", 
                "\"It is one of these things that can be serious ... but if it occurs, there should be an automatic deployment of oxygen masks,\" said David Kaminski Morrow, deputy news editor of the British-based magazine Air Transport Intelligence.", 
                "\"The crew get oxygen, passengers will be on oxygen and there is enough in the tanks to get the aircraft to an altitude where you don't need the oxygen masks anymore,\" he added.", 
                "The crew would attempt to bring the plane down to an altitude of about 10,000 feet (3,050 meters), where the air is breathable.", 
                "This would typically be done over the sea rather than a mountainous area, Kaminski Morrow said.", 
                "A spokesman for the Greek air force said the F-16s intercepted the plane at an altitude of 10,360 meters (34,000 feet).", 
                "Eric Moody, a former pilot, told Sky television that the crew's failure to bring the plane down in altitude suggested they were overwhelmed by the situation, hinting at a major problem with the oxygen system.", 
                "\"If the aircraft is at 30,000 feet (9,150 meters), you don't stay conscious for long, maybe 15 to 30 seconds.", 
                "It is like standing on top of Mount Everest,\" Kaminski Morrow said.", 
                "Gerard Feldzer, the head of France's Air and Space Museum, said many questions remained unanswered.", 
                "\"An explosive depressurization with damage.",

                "\"Was there a general poisoning (of some kind)?", 
                "That seems rather improbable because a passenger sent a text message\" to a relative after the pilots apparently lost consciousness, he said.", 
                "Even if the pilots somehow had become incapacitated by a drop in pressure, there would be no reason for the plane to crash straight away, the experts said.", 
                "\"The pressurizing system is totally independent from the flying controls,\" Moody told Sky.", 
                "\"If it was on automatic pilot at the time, as it probably would have been, there's no reason why it would have crashed immediately due to lack of pressure.", 
                "\" In a case with possible parallels, a lack of oxygen apparently caused the 1999 crash that killed golfer Payne Stewart and four others aboard Stewart's twin-engined jet.", 
                "The plane went down in a pasture in South Dakota after flying halfway across the United States on autopilot, as the five apparently became unconscious after the plane lost cabin pressure.", 
                "Experts were puzzled by reports that passengers may have remained conscious longer than the pilots.", 
                "One passenger reportedly sent a text message before the crash to say that the pilots were unconscious and \"we are all frozen.", 
                "\" Greek government spokesman Theodoros Roussopoulos said that when the F-16 pilots flew by the Helios Airways plane a second time, they saw two people apparently trying to take control of the Boeing 737.", 
                "It was unclear whether they were passengers or pilots.", 
                "\"The cabin pressure and the cockpit pressure are the same,\" said Yates, noting that a failure should affect both equally.", 
                "\"It's possible some of the passengers on board, because of their age, because of their health or whatever, may have been able to last a bit longer,\" he said."

                "The Greek government on Sunday ruled out the possibility of a terror attack after a Cypriot Boeing 737 operated by the private Helios Airways crashed Sunday north of Athens, killing all 115 passengers and six crew members on board.", 
                "PLANE CRASHES AFTER LOSING CONTACT The plane crashed to a mountain at about 12:20 p.m. (0920 GMT) near the coastal town of Grammatikos, about 40 km north of Athens, just a few minutes before its scheduled landing time on a flight from Larnaca International Airport of Cyprus to Prague via Athens.", 
                "Police and firefighters at the crash site reportedly said there were no immediate signs of survivors.", 
                "Among the passengers on the flight were 48 children, a spokesman for Helios Airways was quoted by Athens News Agency as saying.", 
                "Reports said the crew notified Cypriot authorities of a fault in the aircraft's air conditioning unit on approaching Greek airspace, but made no contact with Greek air traffic controllers on entry.", 
                "Greek civil aviation authorities alerted the air force in line with anti-terrorism measures.", 
                "Two F-16 fighter jets sent from a military base in Crete located the aircraft a few minutes later in the southern Aegean, but calls for identification went unheeded and the plane appeared to be out of control, reports said.", 
                "Flying at close quarters, air force officers reported that the aircraft's co-pilot appeared to have collapsed over his controls but no captain was visible through the cockpit window.", 
                "Overhead oxygen masks in the cabin section had dropped into place.", 
                "After reporting the aircraft as \"renegade,\" or unidentified, the pilots tracked the airliner at about 38,000 feet until it began to lose height and crashed sparking a blaze.", 
                "GREEK GOVERNMENT RULES OUT TERRORISM The Greek government said on Sunday that no evidence of terrorism or foul play had emerged after the plane crashed.", 
                "Government spokesman Theodoros Roussopoulos flatly rejected media speculation that two air force fighter jets, which were sent to track the aircraft after its crew failed to communicate with Greece's air traffic control on its entry, had been ordered to shoot down the plane on fears of terrorism.", 
                "\"There was no such thought,\" he told reporters after a lengthy cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis, who cut short his long weekend holiday and returned to Athens.", 
                "Meanwhile, Cypriot officials said there is no evidence of terrorism so far.", 
                "\"The first indications, in Cyprus and in Greece, are that it was not caused by a terrorist act,\" said Marios Karoyian, a spokesman for Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos in Nicosia.", 
                "GREEK GOVERNMENT, EU OFFER CONDOLENCES Greek Prime Minister Karamanlis cut short a long holiday weekend and called an emergency mini-cabinet meeting.", 
                "He called Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos by telephone and expressed his condolences.", 
                "European Union (EU) Transport Commissioner Jacques Barrot also expressed his condolences to victims of the crash.", 
                "\"It is with great sadness that I have learned of today's airliner crash near Athens, which has cost the lives of all on board.", 
                "My sympathies go out to the families and friends of the victims and all those affected by this tragic event,\" said Barrot in a statement.", 
                "\"This latest incident shows that in spite of all that has already been done to improve the safety of Europe's skies, we must intensify our joint efforts to ensure the very highest safety standards for all Europe's air passengers and crew,\" he added.", 
                "MYSTERY REMAINS OVER DOOMED PLANE Though official sources suspected that an apparently technical problem could have caused the tragedy, accident investigators still faced a mystery over the last minutes of the doomed plane.", 
                "The crash, the worst air disaster in Greece and the worst involving a Cypriot airline, perplexed aviation experts astounded by what appeared to have been a catastrophic failure of cabin pressure or oxygen supply at 10 km up.", 
                "Experts were also looking into what might have happened in the last minutes of the plane which was declared \"renegade\" when it entered Greek air space and failed to make radio contact, causing two F-16 air force jets planes to scramble to investigate.", 
                "Greek government spokesman Roussopoulos said the pilots sent to investigate reported that with the pilots out of action there may have been a last-gasp effort by two others on the plane to bring the craft back under control.", 
                "The pilots also saw oxygen masks down when they got close to the aircraft.", 
                "The plane was making continuous right-hand turns to show it had lost radio contact, he said.", 
                "Reports also disclosed that passengers aboard the flight had sent text messages to relatives complaining of an \"Arctic chill\" in the cabin with people starting to turn blue from the cold.", 
                "A senior official at the Public Order Ministry speculated that a sudden drop in cabin pressure could have caused the disaster.", 
                "He said the pilot had mentioned a problem with the plane's air-conditioning system before losing contact.", 
                "But other experts said a sudden loss of pressurization would not have caused an airplane to crash, nor would it have made the pilots immediately unconscious, as the pilots would have had their own oxygen supply.", 
                "Roussopoulos said the black box of the plane had been found and investigation of the cause had been under way.", 
                "US investigators were on their way to Athens as US law requires them to help with the investigation whenever a US-made aircraft is involved."
