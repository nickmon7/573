				"Obesity is number one health threat associated with nutrition in Kuwait, Director of Food and Nutrition Department of the Ministry of health Fawzia Al-Awadi said in a recent study.",
				"According to his study, 42 percent of Kuwaiti women and 28 percent of men are obese. Twenty-eight percent of Kuwaiti men are overweight.",
				"The ratio of female to male in Kuwaiti population is 51:49.",
				"Several factors contribute to the higher prevalence of obesity in adult women, Al-Awadi said. These factors include repeated pregnancies, rapid decline in breast feeding, an early introduction to bottle feeding as well as poor eating habits.",
				"She revealed that police and army personnel were more susceptible to becoming overweight (34.4 percent) while obesity was most prevalent among males with a technical profession.",
				"\"Regular food consumption between meals, the use of sugar in tea, and the consumption of an additional meal at Diwaniya (men's leisure time in chatting gathering) contributed significantly to the development of obesity among this group,\" she explained.",
				"Al-Awadi's another survey conducted among 1,154 obese patients revealed that nearly one quarter of them had hypertension and about 33 percent suffered diabetes.",
				"Al-Awadi noted that \"it has been shown that obesity shortens life which is mainly due to cardiovascular and cerebro-vascular diseases, constituting an additional risk to overweight patients.\"",
				"The nutritionist also said a large percentage of Kuwaiti children are suffering from malnutrition due to bad feeding habits that cause iron deficiency anemia. She said the intake of vitamin C rich foods such as fruit juices are very low, particularly among pre-school children.",
				"Factors affecting the eating habits in Kuwait are income, food prices, food import policies and the drastic change in food formula, she reiterated. Increase in family income causes a change in the dietary patterns that mainly are represented by an increase in consumption of soft drinks, tea, chocolates, sweets, nuts and ready-made foods. "
