                "The growth will be registered in both developed and, especially, developing countries, due to population aging, unhealthy diets, obesity and a secondary lifestyle.", 
                "According to the U.N. health agency, about 20 percent of diabetics develop the so-called insulin-dependent form of diabetes, or IDDM, and live on with insulin injections, while about 30 percent of the non-IDDM cases may use insulin injections to control their conditions.", 
                "The WHO considers insulin an essential drug.", 
                "However, it noted that in some developing countries, the drug that turns the once fatal IDDM into a treatable disease is still unavailable or unaffordable.", 
                "A vial of insulin may cost a month's salary in many African countries, according to it.", 
                "Diabetes is a chronic disease caused by the human body's failure to produce insulin or to produce effective insulin.", 
                "The deficiency leads to increased concentrations of glucose in blood and thus damage the body's many systems, particularly blood vessels and nerves.",

                " KUWAIT CITY, January 23 (Xinhua) -- More than half of the 710,000 Kuwaiti citizens are suffering from obesity and anemia because of poor eating habits and other causes, according to studies by a leading local nutritionist.", 
                "Obesity is number one health threat associated with nutrition in Kuwait, Director of Food and Nutrition Department of the Ministry of health Fawzia Al-Awadi said in a recent study.", 
                "According to his study, 42 percent of Kuwaiti women and 28 percent of men are obese.", 
                "Twenty-eight percent of Kuwaiti men are overweight.", 
                "The ratio of female to male in Kuwaiti population is 51:49.", 
                "Several factors contribute to the higher prevalence of obesity in adult women, Al-Awadi said.", 
                "These factors include repeated pregnancies, rapid decline in breast feeding, an early introduction to bottle feeding as well as poor eating habits.", 
                "She revealed that police and army personnel were more susceptible to becoming overweight (34.4 percent) while obesity was most prevalent among males with a technical profession.", 
                "\"Regular food consumption between meals, the use of sugar in tea, and the consumption of an additional meal at Diwaniya (men's leisure time in chatting gathering) contributed significantly to the development of obesity among this group,\" she explained.", 
                "Al-Awadi's another survey conducted among 1,154 obese patients revealed that nearly one quarter of them had hypertension and about 33 percent suffered diabetes.", 
                "Al-Awadi noted that \"it has been shown that obesity shortens life which is mainly due to cardiovascular and cerebro-vascular diseases, constituting an additional risk to overweight patients.", 
                "\" The nutritionist also said a large percentage of Kuwaiti children are suffering from malnutrition due to bad feeding habits that cause iron deficiency anemia.", 
                "She said the intake of vitamin C rich foods such as fruit juices are very low, particularly among pre-school children.", 
                "Factors affecting the eating habits in Kuwait are income, food prices, food import policies and the drastic change in food formula, she reiterated.", 
                "Increase in family income causes a change in the dietary patterns that mainly are represented by an increase in consumption of soft drinks, tea, chocolates, sweets, nuts and ready-made foods. "
