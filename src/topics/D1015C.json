                "RIO DE JANEIRO, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Brazil and Malaysia are to jointly launch a series of remote sensing satellites (RSS) from 1998 to monitor tropical forests.", 
                "The launching of the RSSs, the first of this kind of satellite on a permanent orbit 900 kilometers above the equator, is estimated to cost 37 millon U.S. dollars.", 
                "The RSSs will monitor 2,200 square kilometers of the Amazon rain forest, which it will pass over every 105 minutes, said Brazil's National Institute of Space Research.", 
                "Satellites currently monitoring the region cannot see clearly through the thick clouds which cover the region for several months annually, but the RSSs can do that.", 
                "Brazil, which is in charge of the design of the RSS, plans to build a land-monitoring base in the Cuiaba city, located in Amazon's Pantanal wetlands.", 
                "Malaysia, also endowed with rich tropical rain forest, will build bases on its territory to pick up and analyse data from the satellites.", 
                "Director of the Brazilian institute, Marcio Nogueira Barbosa, recently visited Malaysia to negotiate the joint launching of the RSSs, a project which is estimated to last eight years."
