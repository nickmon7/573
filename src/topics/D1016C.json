				"JAKARTA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- In an apparent response to mounting demands from students and opposition groups, Indonesian legislators on Friday agreed to launch an investigation into former president Soeharto's wealth.",
				"All five factions of the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), the country's highest legislative body, agreed to add a provision in a decree on clean governance, preventing centralization of power, corruption, collusion and nepotism.",
				"Article four of the decree states that efforts to eradicate corruption, collusion and nepotism must be made indiscriminately upon any state officials, former state officials, their families and cronies as well as private businessmen, business tycoons and former president Soeharto.",
				"After an uncertain response to wide calls for a thorough investigation into the wealth of Soeharto, his family and friends, the dominant Golkar (Functional Group) faction has finally changed its position, saying that it strongly supports the wealth probe.",
				"Addressing a plenary meeting on Wednesday, Golkar spokesperson Marwah Daud Ibrahim said the implementation of a clean government, with no traces of corruption, collusion and nepotism, is a prerequisite to achievement of the aims of the 1945 proclamation.",
				"This is the first time Golkar officially declared war against corruption, collusion and nepotism. During the 32 year rule of Soeharto, Golkar had been in the government bandwagon, given an amen to virtually all the regime's policies and whims.",
				"However, Golkar voiced objections to proposals that the special MPR session adopt a special decree to investigate Soeharto's wealth. It said it would be more relevant if the call for the probe into the riches of the former president and his family was made part of the decree on corruption, collusion and nepotism.",
				"The United Development Party faction earlier asked for a separate decree to contain investigation into Soeharto, officials, former officials and their families.",
				"The faction's spokesman Djuhad Mahja told reporters that they finally agreed with the decree on anti-corruption, collusion and nepotism because the faction's proposal had been accommodated in it.",
				"Commenting on the stand of the Golkar on the subject, the Jakarta Post said, "This is another display of their halfhearted commitment to clean up corruption. A clause in a decree can easily be ignored, but a specific decree would give the needed impetus to kick start the investigation.""

				"The purpose of his visit is to explain that Switzerland's banking secrecy is "not absolute" as long as there is a formal demand from a particular country to launch investigations into a suspected bank account, he said.",
				""We would not take the initiative (to launch the investigation), it has to come from the country of origin of the person (suspected of having illegally-gained deposits)," he added.",

				"Soeharto, in a speech on the channel controlled by his eldest daughter Siti Hardijanti Rukmana on Sunday, said: "The fact is, I don't have even one cent of savings abroad, don't have accounts at foreign banks... let alone hundreds of billion of dollars."",
				"American magazine Forbes estimated in July that Soeharto, who stepped down amid mounting public pressure on May 21, had a fortune worth 4 billion U.S. dollars."
