				"Also Thursday, a judge postponed to Friday a ruling on a petition from the justice official, Paul van der Sloot, to see his jailed 17-year-old son, Joran, said Attorney General Caren Janssen. The judge also postponed to Friday a ruling on a request from lawyers defending the youth and his two Surinamese friends to see any evidence authorities have gathered, Janssen said. Janssen declined to say whether the judge was considering other petitions related to the case.",
				"Van der Sloot, from Holland, is training to be a judge in Aruba, a Dutch Caribbean island.",
				"More than two weeks after 18-year-old Alabama resident Natalee Holloway went missing, numerous searches by authorities, volunteer islanders and tourists have led nowhere, and no one has been charged in the case. Authorities have refused to say whether they think Holloway is dead.",
				"On Thursday, however, Police Supt. Jan van der Straaten told The Associated Press that they used the helicopter "to search for possible remains _ but found nothing."",
				"He declined to say where the helicopter searched or whether authorities believed there was a body to find.",
				"On Wednesday, investigators brought in from Holland and police using a German Shepherd searched the van der Sloots' one-story, yellow-beige home, where Joran lived in an attached apartment. Agents were seen carrying two white garbage bags filled with items from the house, while authorities towed away a blue sport utility vehicle and a red Jeep from the property in Noord, outside the capital, Oranjestad.",
				"Van der Straaten declined to give details on what they found. "We are still busy with the investigation and interrogations of suspects," he said Thursday.",
				"Following the approximately four-hour search, Janssen, the attorney general, clarified that Paul van der Sloot was not under investigation.",
				"Asked why it took investigators more than two weeks after Holloway's disappearance to search the van der Sloot home, Janssen said Thursday, "You have to build up an investigation. You can't just go in there like a cowboy, you have to give certain direction to investigators."",
				"Joran remains in police custody along with Deepak Kalpoe, 21, and Satish Kalpoe, 18, of Suriname. The three were questioned and released shortly after Holloway's May 30 disappearance. They were formally arrested last Thursday.",
				"The two brothers have told police that they and Joran were with Holloway and that she and the Dutch youth were petting in the back seat of their car. The detainees initially said they took Holloway to a beach on the northern part of the island then dropped her off at her Holiday Inn hotel, where they claimed she was approached by a security guard.",
				"But Antonius "Mickey" John, a former hotel security guard released from custody on Sunday, told reporters that Deepak Kalpoe told him during a chat in jail that he and his brother actually dropped the young van der Sloot and Holloway off together near the Marriott, about 10 blocks north of the Holiday Inn. John said he passed the information on to police.",
				"Kalpoe's lawyer would not comment on John's statement Wednesday, but said his client maintained his innocence.",
				"Van der Straaten declined to give a timeline Thursday on when the investigation could conclude, or when Joran and the Kalpoe brothers might either be released or formally charged.",
				"He dismissed rumors that police may investigate coastal waters on the north side of the island known to have sharks. "Sure, we have shark places on the northern side, but they have nothing to do with the investigation," he said.",
				"Holloway was celebrating her graduation from Mountain Brook High School, near Birmingham, Alabama, with 124 other students and seven chaperones when she vanished during the early hours of May 30. Her U.S. passport and packed bags were found in her room.",
				"The law says authorities can hold detainees for up to 116 days without filing formal charges. The three young men have been in custody since June 9.",
				"It was not immediately clear why van der Sloot had not been allowed to see his son or whether the youth's mother had been allowed to. After the three young men were detained, the attorney general's office said Dutch law permits parents to see minors in jail.",
				"Aruba follows Dutch law as a former colony in the Netherlands Antilles, from which it seceded in 1986 to become an independent member of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.",

			"sentences":[
				"A fourth man, a tour boat disc jockey, was arrested Friday as the latest suspect in the case of missing Alabama teen Natalee Holloway.",
				"The man, identified by his aunt as Steve Gregory Croes, 26, was questioned and remains in jail. Police did not impound his automobile, a late model Honda, or remove anything from his home, according to his aunt, Mary Croes.",
				""He has lived here about three months with his grandparents," Croes said. "We don't have too much contact with him, because he is so young. When he left (the home Friday) he said, 'I will be back this afternoon.' "",
				"Croes said he was contacted by police Thursday night and went to the station voluntarily to give a statement, his employer, Marcus Wiggins, told The Associated Press.",
				"Croes said he knew one of two Surinamese brothers being held in the case because they went to the same Internet cafe, Wiggins said.",
				"Croes was a DJ on the Tattoo, which offers nightly dining, dancing and swimming, Wiggins said.",
				"In Alabama, a woman who helped organize Holloway's graduation trip, Jody Bearman, said students did not go on the Tattoo as a group, although some could have taken a boat ride without the seven adult chaperons knowing. "The chaperons were not supposed to keep up with their every move," Bearman said.",
				"A judge heard motions Friday from lawyers for the two brothers, Deepak Kalpoe, 21, and Satish Kalpoe, 18, and a Dutch youth, Joran Van Der Sloot, 17 -- the three prime suspects in the case, who were the last people known to have seen Holloway before she disappeared in the wee hours of May 30.",
				"The judge in the case, Bob Kit, will decide by Sunday whether there is enough evidence to keep them in jail. No one has been charged in the case, and lawyers for all three men say they are innocent.",
				"Holloway disappeared the day she was to return from a five-day trip with 124 other students celebrating their graduation from high school in Mountain Brook, Ala., a suburb of Birmingham. Her disappearance, unsolved despite scores of searches of the island by volunteers and police, has increasingly become a source of discord on the island, where the slogan on auto tags is "One Happy Island."",
				"Many locals believe news coverage has been overblown, and others believe Holloway is still alive.",
				""This is not fair what the American press is saying," said Denny Scoop, a lifelong resident, sipping a beer Friday afternoon at J&amp;J Snacks in Noord. "It is tarnishing our reputation. How many people have gone missing in the U.S. in the last three weeks?"",
				"The missing girl's mother, who refuses to leave the island until she learns her daughter's fate, said she is unhappy with the progress of the investigation. "This case is not that hard to figure out," Beth Holloway Twitty said. "Those boys have the answers."",
				"Holloway Twitty has said that if investigators do not make progress soon, she might start believing they are trying to protect the detainees. Van Der Sloot is the son of a Dutch judge.",
				""We are in day 18 with no answers," she said Friday. "I want my daughter and I want her now."",
				"Holloway Twitty said she would "believe my daughter is alive until I find out otherwise."",
				"Jeffry Scott writes for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. E-mail: jscott@ajc.com",

			"headline":"Searcher: Missing teen's family found suspects before Aruban police",
			"sentences":[
				"Natalee Holloway's family, not Aruban police, first identified and located a Dutch youth now held as a suspect in the disappearance of the Alabama teen, according to a friend who helped with the search.",
				"The family's amateur detective work _ based on a combination of hunches and tips on the Caribbean island _ also led to two of the youth's friends who also were taken into custody. But it ultimately led to frustration when authorities failed to immediately arrest the trio, which included the son of a prominent Dutch ministry official.",
				""She had been missing less than 24 hours and we had all three names and addresses, so it's just disappointing that they weren't able to move faster," said Jody Bearman, who organized the graduation trip to Aruba for 125 students from Mountain Brook High School and seven chaperones.",
				"The three weren't taken into custody until 10 days after Holloway's family knew of them. The search for Holloway was still under way on Saturday.",
				"Aruban authorities have defended their work in the nearly three weeks since Holloway failed to show up for the trip home to Alabama. Police work takes time, they have said.",
				"Mariaine Croes, a spokeswoman for the attorney general's office in Aruba, declined comment Saturday on how authorities initially learned of the three suspects.",
				""We have to wait for the investigation to finish," she said. A fourth suspect, the disc jockey from a party boat, is also in custody.",
				"In an interview Friday with The Associated Press, Bearman said Aruban authorities couldn't be faulted completely for failing to identify van der Sloot and the others more quickly, something she said the amateur sleuths did in less than three hours in Aruba.",
				""They did not know what was going on," she said. "We were there on a mission."",
				"Terrified after hearing news any parent dreads, Beth Holloway Twitty landed in Aruba about 12 hours after learning her daughter Natalee had vanished.",
				"Accompanied by her husband and friends including Bearman on a donated corporate jet, Holloway Twitty had a few bits of information from Mountain Brook graduates who were on the trip, most importantly a physical description of a Dutch teenager _ a judge's son, they thought _ with whom Natalee was seen leaving a bar, Carlos' N Charlies', on May 30, the night she disappeared.",
				"Bearman said the group also was told that Holloway's friends had seen the same teenager in the casino at the hotel where they were staying.",
				"With help from some locals, Holloway's mother and the others determined the youth had been in the casino playing in a poker tournament, according to Bearman. Players had to sign in, she said, and that gave them a name and initial: Joran V.",
				""After talking to enough people, we were able to deduce that it was Joran van der Sloot," she said. "Once we got the name we were able to track the address through people and we got the police. They escorted us and we went straight to the house."",
				"Van der Sloot's father, Aruban judge-in-training Paul van der Sloot, said his son was out playing poker when the group first arrived at the house around 1 a.m., Bearman said. Still accompanied by police, the group went to a couple of places looking for van der Sloot before returning to the father's house and finding Joran van der Sloot there with one of the two Surinamese brothers who later were detained, she said.",
				""Basically we interrogated him," Bearman said. "He never denied being with her."",
				"Van der Sloot described dancing with Holloway at the bar and said "she wanted to go with me" at closing time, according to Bearman.",
				"Van der Sloot claimed he left Holloway outside the Holiday Inn resort where the group was staying after they took a late-night trip to a scenic lighthouse, Bearman said, and he even accompanied the family to the hotel to show them the exact spot where she was dropped off.",
				"His story didn't add up, though, according to Bearman.",
				""We started pressing him on that because we had students who were in the lobby until 5 a.m., and she never arrived," she said.",
				"While Aruban police were present during the questioning of van der Sloot, which lasted until about 3 a.m., officers left the talking to Holloway's family until things began to get "heated," Bearman said.",
				"Van der Sloot and the Surinamese brothers _ Deepak Kalpoe, 21, and Satish Kalpoe, 18 _ were interrogated by police the next day and released. Although they were later taken into custody, no one has been charged.",
				"Two one-time security guards were taken into custody because van der Sloot and the brothers said they saw Holloway outside the hotel with a security guard, but both have since been released.",
				"The fourth person in custody, Steve Gregory Croes, 26, played music on a tourist party barge called the "Tattoo," but none of the Mountain Brook teens were known to have gone on the boat, Bearman said. An employer of Croes said the disc jockey knew one of the Surinamese brothers through an Internet cafe.",

			"headline":"Judge in Aruba extends detention of three young men in connection with U.S. teen's disappearance",
			"sentences":[
				"A judge on Saturday ordered the teen son of a prominent justice official and his two friends to stay in jail for at least a week more while investigators continue their search for clues in the disappearance of a young U.S. woman.",
				"A fourth man detained in the case was to appear before a judge Monday, said Attorney General spokeswoman Mariaine Croes.",
				"The man was identified by his boss as Steve Gregory Croes, a 26-year-old disc jockey on the privately owned party boat "Tattoo." He was arrested early Friday, a day after being contacted by police and giving them a statement, "Tattoo" owner Marcus Wiggins told The Associated Press on Friday.",
				"Under Dutch law, which Aruba follows as a Dutch protectorate, authorities can detain individuals for up to 116 days without filing formal charges. A judge must review the case after the first 10 days, and then periodically after that.",
				"Judge Bob Wit, who was sent in from the neighboring Dutch island of Curacao, extended the detention of Joran van der Sloot, 17, and brothers, Deepak Kalpoe, 21, and Satish Kalpoe, 18, for eight days, said Mariaine Croes, who is not related to the fourth detainee.",
				"Natalee Holloway, 18, of Mountain Brook, Alabama, disappeared in the early hours of May 30, the last day of a five-day vacation with 124 other students to celebrate their high school graduation.",
				"Searches by authorities, volunteer islanders and tourists have led nowhere. Investigators were refusing to say if they thought Holloway was dead. Her mother, Beth Holloway Twitty, has said she will continue to believe Natalee is alive until she has proof otherwise.",
				"Van der Sloot is the son of Paul van der Sloot, of the Netherlands, who is training to be a judge in Aruba.",
				"In Alabama, a friend of Holloway's family said Natalee's relatives, not Aruban police, first identified and located Joran and the Kalpoe brothers _ less than a day after the young woman disappeared, and only three hours after family members started looking.",
				""She had been missing less than 24 hours and we had all three names and addresses, so it's just disappointing that they (authorities) weren't able to move faster," Jody Bearman, who organized the graduation trip and went to Aruba to help in the search, said in an interview with the AP on Friday.",
				"The three young men weren't taken into custody until 10 days after Holloway's family first knew of them.",
				"Aruban authorities have defended their investigation, saying police work takes time. Mariaine Croes declined comment Saturday on how authorities initially learned of the three young men. "We have to wait for the investigation to finish," she said.",
				"Holloway Twitty, 44, has insisted that Joran and the Kalpoes hold the key to the investigation and that authorities pressure the young men harder to tell the truth. She said if there is not significant progress soon in the case, she may start to believe that authorities are protecting the detainees. Aruban authorities have said they are pursuing all leads and protecting no one.",
				"Holloway Twitty sat on the front pew during a Mass dedicated to her family Saturday night at a Pentecostal church.",
				""We admire the strength and courage you've shown as a mother," pastor Gilbert Martes told the missing teen's mother, who listened to the sermon with her eyes closed.",
				"On Friday, a judge ruled on a petition from the elder van der Sloot to visit his son, whom he has not been allowed to see since Joran was detained on June 9, and from the Kalpoes' attorneys requesting to see any evidence prosecutors may have gathered, Croes said. Both Croes and Court secretary Isella Wernet refused to reveal the rulings. Defense attorneys did not return calls seeking comment.",
				"On Wednesday, investigators towed two vehicles and searched the premises of the van der Sloot home in Noord, outside the capital of Oranjestad. Joran lived in an apartment attached to the main house. Authorities have not released the results of the search, but Attorney General Caren Janssen has said that Paul van der Sloot is not under investigation.",
				"It was not entirely clear how Croes might be connected to the other detainees. He told Wiggins that he knew one of the Kalpoe brothers because he went to the same Internet cafe, Wiggins said.",
				"Wiggins did not comment on Croes' possible involvement in Natalee Holloway's disappearance. He said he had never seen any of the three young men aboard the "Tattoo," a party boat offering dining, dancing and swimming whose patrons must be 18 and older.",
				"Holloway Twitty remarked Friday that Croes' arrest was "just the beginning," and that she believed additional people might be brought into custody. She did not elaborate, however, and also declined to say what she knew about Croes.",
				""There is a chance we'll have more suspects, but it's impossible to speculate now because we are still investigating," Mariaine Croes said Saturday.",
				"Police Superintendent Jan van der Straaten refused to identify Croes by name Friday but said that the latest detainee was arrested based on information provided by one of the three young men already in custody. The attorney general's office released a statement Friday identifying Croes' only by his initials, S.G.C., age 26.",

			"sentences":[
				"On Sunday, the family of missing Alabama teen Natalee Holloway searched the caves on the southwest corner of this island in Arikok National Park, while in downtown Oranjestad life was slower than",
				"The country's tourism office had cancelled the annual "The Party Goes On Parade" of people dressed in costumes streaming through the streets in a kind of small scale Mardi Gras to attract vacationers in June, the low season for this tropical island in the Caribbean visited by about half a million Americans a year.",
				"It has been a hard week in paradise.",
				"And three weeks into the search for Holloway there are no clear signs the mystery of the missing teen, not seen since the early morning hours of May 30, is about to be solved -- nor are Aruba's image woes.",
				"In the past week authorities released the first two suspects arrested in the case, then arrested a fourth Friday. They staged a highly-publicized spectacle of a search of a beach where a local DJ claimed to have found a pair of women's underwear and condoms. They searched the island by helicopter using infrared technology.",
				"On Saturday night -- in a scene that seemed to sum up every bizarre aspect of the investigation and press frenzy -- TV crews chased Paulus Van Der Sloot, a judge, and the father of one of four detained suspects in the case, Joran Van Der Sloot, 17.",
				"The elder Van Der Sloot was coming out of the downtown Oranjestad police station, where he had been brought for questioning in connection with the case.",
				"Seeing the camera crews, he broke into a sprint and a cameraman for CNN caught up to him as he frantically tried to unlock the door of his Mercedes and drive off.",
				""Mr. Van Der Sloot!" yelled a CNN cameraman. "Why are you running?"",
				"Government spokesman Rueben Trappenberg said Sunday there are no signs the worldwide publicity, much of it bad, has hurt tourism on Aruba where automobile tags bear the slogan "One Happy Island." But he conceded the furor over Holloway's disappearance has dented Aruba's image as the safest island in the Caribbean.",
				""I can run you through the list of things we've been misportrayed of, fantastical things, from a high level government cover-up, to drug cartel, to prostitution and slavery," said Trappenberg." We are not Pirates of the Caribbean."",
				"Through the weekend CNN and FOX -- each with crews of about 10 -- showed few signs of losing interest in the story that continues to spike ratings even though government officials and lawyers offer few comments or details of the investigation.",
				"Camera crews sometime spend hours just waiting outside the courthouse to hoping to get a shot of a suspect leaving, and a what usually turns out to be a no-comment from lawyers and prosecutors.",
				"On Monday, the latest suspect, tour boat disc jockey Steve Croes, 26, is expected to come before a judge who will rule whether prosecutors have enough information to hold him on suspicion of premeditated murder, murder, and kidnapping with fatal consequence.",
				"Those are the same suspicions prosecutors have used to hold three suspects who have been in custody for eleven days: Joran Van Der Sloot, 17, and brother Deepak Kalpoe, 21, and Satish Kalpoe, 18.",
				"The elder Van Der Sloot was called into police headquarters again Sunday for questioning and was released. His wife, Anita Van Der Sloot, said Friday her husband duty's as a lower level judge have been suspended during the the investigation; but that could not be confirmed Sunday through officials.",
				"Island authorities said they are exerting every effort to crack the case, which is why the Oranjestad parade was cancelled Sunday. The parade gave the wrong impression Aruba officials still place promoting tourism as a top priority, said Trappenberg, and it would have put about 300 officers on streets to manage crowds and traffic.",
				""Those police should be searching or investigating the case instead," said the spokesman.",
				"Resentment of the media's dogged pursuit of the Holloway investigation has angered some. Elvis Weert, a disc jockey on Aruba Radio Top 95, is one of the most vocal opponents of what he sees as disproportionate coverage of an aberrant incident.",
				"He said the American media should scrutinize its own country as thoroughly as it has examined Aruba. "How many children have gone missing in the United States in the last month?" he said. "You don't hear anything about that."",
				"Another radio host, Dick Miller, who, for 16 years has hosted an nightly music and talk program Canal 90 FM and, for a time, served as "Honorary goodwill ambassador to Aruba," said listeners have called saying they are distraught that Holloway is missing and distraught that it has happened in Aruba.",
				""This is a place of hospitality, not hostility," he said. "Nothing like this ever happens and people just don't know how to cope with it. They are extremely concerned about Natalee and her family, but everybody is affected. People can't sleep. It's terrible."",
				"As FOX and CNN have pushed to scoop each they have both made missteps. At one point a week ago there were reports of a body found, a stain identified as blood in the automobile Natalee Holloway allegedly rode in, and a confession from one of the suspects.",
				"None turned out to be true -- but that hasn't slowed pursuit of the story. The tabloid TV show "A Current Affair" plans to air an entire program on Aruba on Monday. The National Enquirer had a reporter on the island all week researching a piece.",
				"Authorities point to the island's crime statistics -- one murder and six rapes were recorded on Aruba last year -- as an evidence that Holloway's disappearance is out of character for an island renowned as one of the safest places on earth.",
				"As much as the media obsession has distorted perceptions of the island, the authorities reluctance to release information has fueled speculation and disconnect. It's not clear how the latest suspect, Steve Croes, is involved.",
				"The Associated Press reported that Croes might have known one of the suspects, Deepak Kalpoe, through meeting him at an internet cafe, but the spokeswoman for the prosecutor, Mariaine Croes declined to comment on that.",
				"Croes ex-wife, Jeanet Gei, said Friday she sees no way her ex-husband could be involved in a violent crime. The father of her three-year old son, he doesn't smoke, he doesn't drink, and he is a gentle. "If he stepped on a lizard, he would cry," she said.",

			"headline":"Police question father of Dutch teen arrested in case of missing teenager in Aruba",
			"sentences":[
				"Police questioned the father of a Dutch teenager detained in connection with the case of a missing American teenager, hoping he may have seen something to help resolve the mystery, officials said Sunday.",
				"Paul van der Sloot, a judge-in-training on the island, was questioned Saturday night, said Police Superintendent Jan van der Straaten.",
				""He was questioned as a witness, no more or no less," van der Straaten told The Associated Press, declining to give details.",
				"The attorney general's spokeswoman, Mariaine Croes, said witnesses are questioned when prosecutors believe they may be able to add something to the case.",
				""You may know something more or you may have seen something more, but you are not a suspect or thought to be part of any crime," said Croes.",
				"Van der Sloot is the father of 17-year-old Joran van der Sloot, one of the last people seen with 18-year-old Natalee Holloway the night she disappeared.",
				"Three other men have been arrested. No one has been charged.",
				"On Saturday a judge ordered the Dutch teenager and his two friends, brothers Deepak Kalpoe, 21, and Satish Kalpoe, 18, to stay in jail for at least another week while investigators continue their search for clues.",
				"A fourth detained man was to appear before a judge Monday, said Croes.",
				"He was identified by his boss as Steve Gregory Croes, a 26-year-old disc jockey on the party boat "Tattoo." He was arrested early Friday, a day after giving police a statement, "Tattoo" owner Marcus Wiggins said Friday. Croes is not related to Mariaine Croes.",
				"Under Dutch law, which Aruba follows as a Dutch protectorate, authorities can detain people for up to 116 days without charging them.",
				"Holloway, of Mountain Brook, Alabama, disappeared in the early hours of May 30, the last day of a five-day vacation with 124 students celebrating their high school graduation.",
				"Searches by authorities, volunteer islanders and tourists have led nowhere. Investigators were refusing to say if they thought Holloway was dead. Her mother, Beth Holloway Twitty, has said she will continue to believe Natalee is alive until she has proof otherwise.",
				"In Alabama, a friend of Holloway's family said Natalee's relatives, not Aruban police, first identified and located Joran and the Kalpoe brothers _ less than a day after the young woman disappeared, and only three hours after family members started looking.",
				""She had been missing less than 24 hours and we had all three names and addresses, so it's just disappointing that they (authorities) weren't able to move faster," Jody Bearman, who organized the graduation trip and went to Aruba to help in the search, said in an interview with the AP on Friday.",
				"The three young men weren't taken into custody until 10 days after Holloway's family first knew of them.",
				"Aruban authorities have defended their investigation, saying police work takes time.",
				"Holloway Twitty, 44, has insisted that Joran and the Kalpoes hold the key to the investigation and that authorities pressure the young men harder to tell the truth. She said if there is not significant progress soon, she may start to believe that authorities are protecting them.",
				"Aruban authorities have said they are pursuing all leads and protecting no one.",
				"Holloway Twitty sat on the front pew during a Mass dedicated to her family Saturday night at a Pentecostal church.",
				""We admire the strength and courage you've shown as a mother," pastor Gilbert Martes told Holloway, who listened to the sermon with her eyes closed.",
				"On Friday, a judge ruled on a petition from the elder van der Sloot to visit his son, whom he has not been allowed to see since Joran was detained on June 9, and from the Kalpoes' attorneys requesting to see any evidence prosecutors may have gathered, Croes said. Officials refused to reveal the rulings.",
				"On Wednesday, investigators searched the van der Sloot home in Noord, outside the capital, Oranjestad, and towed away two vehicles. Joran lived in an apartment attached to the main house. Authorities have not released the results of the search.",
				"It was not entirely clear how Croes might be connected to the other detainees. He told Wiggins that he knew one of the Kalpoe brothers because he went to the same Internet cafe, Wiggins said.",
				"Holloway Twitty remarked Friday that Croes' arrest was "just the beginning," and that she believed more people might be brought into custody.",
				""There is a chance we'll have more suspects, but it's impossible to speculate now because we are still investigating," said the attorney general's spokeswoman.",
