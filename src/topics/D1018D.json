                " Almost a week after arresting the son of a prominent Dutch judge in the disappearance of Alabama teen Natalee Holloway, officials in Aruba searched his home Wednesday.", 
                "Police -- including what appeared to be forensic investigators in protective clothing -- searched the family home of Joran Van Der Sloot, the 17-year-old son of Judge Paul Van Der Sloot.", 
                "Investigators towed two vehicles from the property, a blue SUV and a red Jeep, and removed garbage bags of items while media trained cameras on the modest, one-story yellow stucco home.", 
                "\"The search is part of the investigation,\" said Mariaine Croes, a spokeswoman for Attorney General Caren Janssen.", 
                "Croes said both cars belonged to the family.", 
                "Janssen, who also went into the house, declined to comment as investigators wrapped up their search at about 4 p.m. \"We are just looking for evidence at the house but have nothing yet,\" police spokesman Edwin Comemencia said.", 
                "The search came shortly after Paul Van Der Sloot filed a motion in court Wednesday morning seeking permission to see his jailed son, who along with brothers Deepak Kalpoe, 21, and Satish Kalpoe, 18, are the last known people to have seen Holloway.", 
                "Also at Wednesday's hearing, defense attorneys filed motions to see the evidence warranting the continued incarceration of their clients, and prosecutors sought the removal of lawyer Antonio Carlo, who is representing Joran Van Der Sloot.", 
                "The judge did not immediately rule on the motions.", 
                "Government spokesman Ruben Trapenberg said prosecutors asked that Carlo be removed because \"they believe he broke a rule\" in representing his client, according to Dutch law.", 
                "\"I don't know what that rule might be,\" Trapenberg said after the hearing.", 
                "The three young men, who today will have been in custody for a week, were loaded into vehicles hidden from view and driven away.", 
                "Their next court appearance is Sunday.", 
                "They have not been charged with any crime.", 
                "On Tuesday afternoon, Aruba police blocked off several hundred yards of beachfront beside the Marriott Hotel while several dozen officers and U.S. FBI agents searched shrubbery-dotted dunes with two bloodhounds and a nearby swampy area was drained.", 
                "\"There were no concrete results from the search yesterday,\" Croes said Wednesday.", 
                "Holloway was celebrating her graduation from Mountain Brook, Ala., High School with 124 other students and seven chaperons when she vanished during the early hours of May 30.", 
                "Her passport and packed bags were found in her room.", 
                "She was last seen by friends leaving the Oranjestad nightclub Carlos 'N Charlie's with Van Der Sloot and the Kalpoe brothers.",

                " Natalee Holloway's family, not Aruban police, first identified and located a Dutch youth now held as a suspect in the disappearance of the Alabama teen, according to a friend who helped with the search.", 
                "The family's amateur detective work _ based on a combination of hunches and tips on the Caribbean island _ also led to two of the youth's friends who also were taken into custody.", 
                "But it ultimately led to frustration when authorities failed to immediately arrest the trio, which included the son of a prominent Dutch ministry official.", 
                "\"She had been missing less than 24 hours and we had all three names and addresses, so it's just disappointing that they weren't able to move faster,\" said Jody Bearman, who organized the graduation trip to Aruba for 125 students from Mountain Brook High School and seven chaperones.", 
                "The three weren't taken into custody until 10 days after Holloway's family knew of them.", 
                "The search for Holloway was still under way on Saturday.", 
                "Aruban authorities have defended their work in the nearly three weeks since Holloway failed to show up for the trip home to Alabama.", 
                "Police work takes time, they have said.", 
                "Mariaine Croes, a spokeswoman for the attorney general's office in Aruba, declined comment Saturday on how authorities initially learned of the three suspects.", 
                "\"We have to wait for the investigation to finish,\" she said.", 
                "A fourth suspect, the disc jockey from a party boat, is also in custody.", 
                "In an interview Friday with The Associated Press, Bearman said Aruban authorities couldn't be faulted completely for failing to identify van der Sloot and the others more quickly, something she said the amateur sleuths did in less than three hours in Aruba.", 
                "\"They did not know what was going on,\" she said.", 
                "\"We were there on a mission.", 
                "\" Terrified after hearing news any parent dreads, Beth Holloway Twitty landed in Aruba about 12 hours after learning her daughter Natalee had vanished.", 
                "Accompanied by her husband and friends including Bearman on a donated corporate jet, Holloway Twitty had a few bits of information from Mountain Brook graduates who were on the trip, most importantly a physical description of a Dutch teenager _ a judge's son, they thought _ with whom Natalee was seen leaving a bar, Carlos' N Charlies', on May 30, the night she disappeared.", 
                "Bearman said the group also was told that Holloway's friends had seen the same teenager in the casino at the hotel where they were staying.", 
                "With help from some locals, Holloway's mother and the others determined the youth had been in the casino playing in a poker tournament, according to Bearman.", 
                "Players had to sign in, she said, and that gave them a name and initial: Joran V. \"After talking to enough people, we were able to deduce that it was Joran van der Sloot,\" she said.", 
                "\"Once we got the name we were able to track the address through people and we got the police.", 
                "They escorted us and we went straight to the house.", 
                "\" Van der Sloot's father, Aruban judge-in-training Paul van der Sloot, said his son was out playing poker when the group first arrived at the house around 1 a.m., Bearman said.", 
                "Still accompanied by police, the group went to a couple of places looking for van der Sloot before returning to the father's house and finding Joran van der Sloot there with one of the two Surinamese brothers who later were detained, she said.", 
                "\"Basically we interrogated him,\" Bearman said.", 
                "\"He never denied being with her.", 
                "\" Van der Sloot described dancing with Holloway at the bar and said \"she wanted to go with me\" at closing time, according to Bearman.", 
                "Van der Sloot claimed he left Holloway outside the Holiday Inn resort where the group was staying after they took a late-night trip to a scenic lighthouse, Bearman said, and he even accompanied the family to the hotel to show them the exact spot where she was dropped off.", 
                "His story didn't add up, though, according to Bearman.", 
                "\"We started pressing him on that because we had students who were in the lobby until 5 a.m., and she never arrived,\" she said.", 
                "While Aruban police were present during the questioning of van der Sloot, which lasted until about 3 a.m., officers left the talking to Holloway's family until things began to get \"heated,\" Bearman said.", 
                "Van der Sloot and the Surinamese brothers _ Deepak Kalpoe, 21, and Satish Kalpoe, 18 _ were interrogated by police the next day and released.", 
                "Although they were later taken into custody, no one has been charged.", 
                "Two one-time security guards were taken into custody because van der Sloot and the brothers said they saw Holloway outside the hotel with a security guard, but both have since been released.", 
                "The fourth person in custody, Steve Gregory Croes, 26, played music on a tourist party barge called the \"Tattoo,\" but none of the Mountain Brook teens were known to have gone on the boat, Bearman said.", 
                "An employer of Croes said the disc jockey knew one of the Surinamese brothers through an Internet cafe.",

                "A fourth man detained in the case was to appear before a judge Monday, said Attorney General spokeswoman Mariaine Croes.", 
                "The man was identified by his boss as Steve Gregory Croes, a 26-year-old disc jockey on the privately owned party boat \"Tattoo.", 
                "\" He was arrested early Friday, a day after being contacted by police and giving them a statement, \"Tattoo\" owner Marcus Wiggins told The Associated Press on Friday.", 
                "Under Dutch law, which Aruba follows as a Dutch protectorate, authorities can detain individuals for up to 116 days without filing formal charges.", 
                "A judge must review the case after the first 10 days, and then periodically after that.", 
                "Judge Bob Wit, who was sent in from the neighboring Dutch island of Curacao, extended the detention of Joran van der Sloot, 17, and brothers, Deepak Kalpoe, 21, and Satish Kalpoe, 18, for eight days, said Mariaine Croes, who is not related to the fourth detainee.", 
                "Natalee Holloway, 18, of Mountain Brook, Alabama, disappeared in the early hours of May 30, the last day of a five-day vacation with 124 other students to celebrate their high school graduation.",

                "\"She had been missing less than 24 hours and we had all three names and addresses, so it's just disappointing that they (authorities) weren't able to move faster,\" Jody Bearman, who organized the graduation trip and went to Aruba to help in the search, said in an interview with the AP on Friday.", 
                "The three young men weren't taken into custody until 10 days after Holloway's family first knew of them.", 
                "Aruban authorities have defended their investigation, saying police work takes time.",

                "On Friday, a judge ruled on a petition from the elder van der Sloot to visit his son, whom he has not been allowed to see since Joran was detained on June 9, and from the Kalpoes' attorneys requesting to see any evidence prosecutors may have gathered, Croes said.", 
                "Both Croes and Court secretary Isella Wernet refused to reveal the rulings.",

                "Wiggins did not comment on Croes' possible involvement in Natalee Holloway's disappearance.", 
                "He said he had never seen any of the three young men aboard the \"Tattoo,\" a party boat offering dining, dancing and swimming whose patrons must be 18 and older.", 
                "Holloway Twitty remarked Friday that Croes' arrest was \"just the beginning,\" and that she believed additional people might be brought into custody.", 
                "She did not elaborate, however, and also declined to say what she knew about Croes.",
