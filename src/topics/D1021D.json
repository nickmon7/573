                "Hillsborough Circuit Judge Wayne Timmerman said LaFave also will forever lose her teaching certificate, must register with the state as a sexual predator, may not have any contact with children including the victim, and will not be allowed to profit from the sale of her story or personal appearances.", 
                "The victim's mother said afterward that the public scrutiny had taken its toll on the family, and they just wanted to see it all end.", 
                "\"If we had continued along this path, this would have followed him forever,\" said the mother, whose name was being withheld to protect her son's identity.", 
                "\"My prayer is that he can leave this behind him and go on and be a happy, healthy young man.", 
                "\" After Tuesday's hearing, Lafave's attorney, John Fitzgibbons, said the plea was \"a fair resolution of this case.", 
                "\" Asked how she felt afterward, Lafave said \"tired.", 
                "\" Fitzgibbons said in July that plea negotiations had broken off because prosecutors insisted on prison time, which he said would be too dangerous for someone as attractive as Lafave.", 
                "He said then that she planned to plead insanity at trial, claiming emotional stress kept her from knowing right from wrong. "
