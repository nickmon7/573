                "The papers include interviews with Lafave's former husband, Kristian Owen Lafave, 27, as well as a woman she dated in high school and a co-worker.", 
                "Some supported Fitzgibbons' claims about her battle with mental illness and the trauma she suffered when she was raped at 13.", 
                "Lafave's former East Bay High schoolmate and lover, Casie Diana Martinez, told prosecutors that the teenage Lafave had struggled with her sexuality and self-image.", 
                "\"Really, that was from her mom pressuring her to a music career and trying to fit that mold of being thin, being a star, you know, fitting that role of being on stage,\" Martinez said.", 
                "Last year, Lafave's attorney said he planned to raise an insanity defense.", 
                "A psychologist hired by the state concluded Lafave was sane when she had sex with the boy.", 
                "But several psychiatrists have since evaluated her and several, Fitzgibbons said, determined that trauma she suffered after she was raped at 13 and her subsequent mental illness may have led her to actions.", 
                "\"If we were at trial, the doctors would be explaining how trauma over the years has affected Debbie.", 
                "These traumatic events have an effect on her bi-polar illness.", 
                "It was my feeling that any juror who listened to the testimony of all the difficulties Debbie has gone through would have found it a very sad and compelling story,\" Fitzgibbons said.", 
                "As in the case of Mary Kay Letourneau, the Washington state school teacher who had a baby with a 13-year-old student, Lafave's case has generated much scrutiny.", 
                "Pundits and reporters across the country have picked through every last detail, from her recent divorce to a judge's decision barring access to police photos of her genitals.", 
                "All along her attorney has turned the spotlight to his advantage.", 
                "He nearly lost that strategic edge last week when Timmerman issued a gag order barring attorneys on both sides from talking publicly about Lafave.", 
                "But Fitzgibbons said the temporary ruling would not have stopped the runaway train of attention aimed at the client he once hinted was too pretty for prison.", 
                "\"If Debbie was not considered attractive by almost every societal standard,\" he said, \"no one would have been paying any attention to this case.", 
                "\" Times staff writer Jennifer Liberto contributed to this report."

                "The former middle school teacher achieved instant notoriety when she was accused of having sex with a 14-year-old student.", 
                "On Tuesday, a judge sentenced her to three years of house arrest and seven years of probation.", 
                "Now classified as a sex offender, Lafave, 25, avoided prison, but she won't be living on Easy Street.", 
                "\"We've gotten over one hurdle with this matter in the criminal justice system, but now the ramification of being a sexual offender will be with Debbie for 10 years or longer,\" said her attorney, John Fitzgibbons.", 
                "The biggest complication for Lafave could be a requirement that she place her name on the state's sex offender registry.", 
                "The database contains the names and addresses of sex offenders and some details of their charges.", 
                "It is available to the public on the Internet.", 
                "Many sex offenders manage to remain relatively anonymous.", 
                "But for a woman whose image has been beamed around the world and plastered on the front pages of newspapers, the registry could prove not just invasive but dangerous.", 
                "\"Debbie and my office have received literally hundreds of letters from all over the country, and some of these letters are disturbing,\" Fitzgibbons said.", 
                "\"I really don't want to get into the details, but that could be a concern if people know where she lives.", 
                "\" Dr. Fred Berlin, a Johns Hopkins University professor, said reintegrating into society is always difficult for sex offenders.", 
                "Founder of the university's Sexual Disorders Clinic, Berlin said that Lafave, like most female offenders, is unlikely to repeat her behavior, but her battle with mental illness and the scrutiny of her case will present extra challenges.", 
                "\"As a society, we try not to have these situations repeat themselves,\" he said, \"but sometimes we put up so many obstacles and challenges that it makes it difficult for them not to repeat this behavior or do other things.", 
                "It affects their self-esteem.", 
                "It affects their ability to earn a living and find a comfortable place to live.", 
                "\" Lafave, who lives in southeast Hillsborough County with her parents, will soon seek her own place, Fitzgibbons said.", 
                "As a sex offender, Lafave is barred from living within 1,000 feet of a school, a playground or other areas where children gather.", 
                "In a county with nearly 200 parks, 400 day care centers, 240 public schools and 1,200 churches that may have youth centers, that will make house-hunting tough.", 
                "There is an establishment every half a square mile that she can't be near.", 
                "Lafave will also be barred from seeking employment in places near children.", 
                "And since many employers require applicants to disclose whether they've been convicted of a felony, Lafave's job search won't be easy.", 
                "Then there's her celebrity status.", 
                "\"She goes to the mall, and people point to her, and people come up to her,\" Fitzgibbons said.", 
                "\"Now, as she begins to look for work and a job, that's going to be a problem because wherever she works, she's going to be the center of attention.", 
                "\" Besides psychological therapy, annual polygraphs and unannounced visits from her probation officer, she will have to submit to an HIV test.", 
                "Lafave must give a blood sample to authorities so that her DNA can be registered in a statewide database.", 
                "She also must abide by a 10 p.m. curfew.", 
                "Even Hillsborough prosecutor Michael Sinacore said the road ahead for Lafave will be difficult.",
