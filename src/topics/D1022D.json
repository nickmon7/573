                " Australia said Tuesday it was engaged in an unprecedented diplomatic campaign to disuade Japan from trying to escalate its killing of whales.", 
                "Prime Minister John Howard intervened personally, writing to his Japanese counterpart Junichiro Koizumi at the weekend to urge Tokyo to reconsider its position on whaling, Environment Minister Ian Campbell said.", 
                "Tokyo has applied to the International Whaling Commission (IWC) for permission to nearly double its annual catch of Minke whales, currently set at 440, and to catch the larger humpback and fin whales which are considered endangered by the World Conservation Union.", 
                "Japan, where whale meat is part of culinary culture, reluctantly halted commercial whaling in line with a 1986 IWC moratorium, but the next year resumed catches under a loophole that allows \"research whaling\".", 
                "Tokyo is believed to have the votes needed to get its request approved at the next IWC meeting which begins Friday in South Korea.", 
                "In his letter to Koizumi, Howard challenged the Japanese claim that it needs to expand its whale kill for research purposes.", 
                "\"Given that non-lethal methods exist for scientific research, Australia believes that there is no basis for killing whales,\" Howard wrote in the two-page letter, excerpts of which were published in The Daily Telegraph Tuesday and confirmed by Campbell.", 
                "Howard, who recently agreed to dispatch 450 troops to guard Japanese army engineers in southern Iraq despite domestic opposition to the move and visited Tokyo last month, said relations between the two countries had never been closer, but that \"good friends should always feel free to disagree\".", 
                "The IWC meeting coincides with the start of Australia's whale watching season, when hundreds of humpbacks swim up the east coast seeking warmer waters during the southern winter.", 
                "Howard noted in his letter that some 1.6 million tourists flock to Australian shores to watch the whale migration each year.", 
                "\"This is clear evidence of the extent of public interest in the continued health and welfare of whales and considerable public concern could be expected, not only in Australia, but across the globe, were whaling to increase,\" he said.", 
                "Campbell said Howard's strongly-worded letter underscored Australia's determination to fight Japan's whaling plan.", 
                "\"The sort of efforts that the prime minister has put in and the efforts I've been putting in over many months will continue over the next few weeks, and we won't stop until we achieve success,\" Campbell said on ABC radio.", 
                "\"What the prime minister has demonstrated is that we are prepared to raise this at levels that it's never been raised before,\" he said.", 
                "\"We're working internationally, we're working bilaterally, we're very, very keen to see firstly, no reopening of commercial whaling, and very importantly, no scientific whaling in the future,\" he said. "

                " Tokyo will not yield to foreign pressure seeking to stop it from whaling, a fisheries official said Tuesday after Australia stepped up a campaign against Japan's annual hunt in the name of scientific research.", 
                "Australian Prime Minister John Howard took the unusual step of intervening personally.", 
                "He wrote to his counterpart Junichiro Koizumi, urging Japan to scrap reported plans to include species considered endangered among those hunted.", 
                "But the Fisheries Agency, without commenting on plans to kill more whales near Australian waters, said Japan would continue the whaling which it argues is done for scientific research.", 
                "\"Our position on research whaling will not change just because of foreign pressure,\" said Takanori Nagatomo, deputy director at the Far Seas Fisheries Division of the agency.", 
                "\"We have been engaging in research whaling to collect scientific data so we can resume commercial whaling,\" he said, adding the agency has not been under any pressure from Koizumi's office or the foreign ministry.", 
                "\"Whaling is also part of the Japanese culture,\" he said.", 
                "Japan, where whale meat is part of the traditional cuisine, reluctantly accepted a 1986 moratorium on commercial whaling by the International Whaling Commission (IWC).", 
                "But it resumed catches in 1987 using a loophole that allows \"research whaling\" and selling the meat on the market, a practice condemned by environmentalists as commercial whaling in disguise.", 
                "Japan says lethal research is necessary for accurate data on whales' ages, eating habits and other details and to prove its view that such whale species as minkes are thriving and consuming valuable fish stock.", 
                "Tokyo will reportedly tell the IWC at a meeting starting this month in South Korea that it intends to nearly double its annual catch of minke whales in the Antarctic Ocean, currently set at 440.", 
                "It also aims to catch the larger humpback and fin whales which are considered endangered by the World Conservation Union, Japanese news reports said.", 
                "In his letter to Koizumi, Howard challenged the Japanese claim that it needs to expand its whale kill for research purposes.", 
                "\"Given that non-lethal methods exist for scientific research, Australia believes that there is no basis for killing whales,\" wrote Howard, noting that 1.6 million tourists flock to Australian shores to watch the whale migration each year.", 
                "Environment Minister Ian Campbell said Australia was \"prepared to raise this at levels that it's never been raised before.", 
                "\" \"The sort of efforts that the prime minister has put in and the efforts I've been putting in over many months will continue over the next few weeks, and we won't stop until we achieve success,\" Campbell said on ABC radio.", 
                "\"We're working internationally.", 
                "We're working bilaterally.", 
                "We're very, very keen to see firstly, no reopening of commercial whaling, and very importantly, no scientific whaling in the future,\" he said.", 
                "Howard recently agreed to dispatch 450 troops to guard Japanese army engineers in southern Iraq despite domestic opposition to the move.", 
                "He visited Tokyo last month and said relations between the two countries had never been closer, but that \"good friends should always feel free to disagree\". "

                "Prime Minister John Howard intervened personally, writing to his Japanese counterpart Junichiro Koizumi at the weekend to urge Tokyo to reconsider its position on whaling.", 
                "However, Japan's Fisheries Agency responded by saying that foreign pressure would not force it into changing its whaling policies.", 
                "Japan, where whale meat is part of culinary culture, reluctantly halted commercial whaling in line with an IWC moratorium in 1986, but the next year resumed catches under a loophole that allows \"scientific research whaling\".", 
                "It has applied to the International Whaling Commission (IWC) for permission to nearly double its annual catch of Minke whales, currently set at 440, and to catch the larger humpback and fin whales which are considered endangered by the World Conservation Union.", 
                "The estimated 2,000 tonnes of meat currently obtained from each year's cull ends up in supermarkets and restaurants across Japan.",

                " Animal advocates hoping to halt a Japanese whale hunt announced plans Tuesday to appeal a legal decision that bars the group from filing a lawsuit against the whaling company Kyodo Senpaku.", 
                "Humane Society International was denied permission by Australia's Federal Court last week to sue the Japanese whaling company for allegedly killing hundreds of whales in Antarctic waters the Australian government has declared a whale sanctuary.", 
                "In rejecting the application, Judge James Allsop said Australia does not have a legal right to stop whaling in international waters protected by Australia because Japan does not recognize Australia's jurisdiction there.", 
                "However, Allsop granted the animal rights group permission to appeal his decision to the full bench of the Federal Court.", 
                "The group's director, Michael Kennedy, said he would appeal the decision within the next two weeks.", 
                "\"A successful appeal to the full Federal Court could force the government to go beyond hitting Japan with rhetoric,\" Kennedy said.", 
                "Australian government officials have refused to support the group, saying they will use diplomacy to urge Japan to curb its whaling activities.", 
                "Commercial whaling was banned by the International Whaling Commission in 1986, but a small number of countries _ including Japan _ maintain scientific whaling programs in which hundreds of whales are killed each year.", 
                "Japan has said it will push for a widening of its research whaling program at a meeting of the IWC that began in Ulsan, South Korea last week.", 
                "Whaling opponents fear that pro-whaling countries like Japan and Norway may have a voting majority at the commission for the first time since the 1986 whaling ban was imposed. "
