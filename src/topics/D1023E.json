				"ROME _ An avalanche crashed through a small Austrian resort on Tuesday, killing at least eight people and leaving dozens missing, in what officials feared could turn out to be Austria's worst snow disaster in years.",
				"Driving snow and deadly winds prevented emergency helicopters from flying into the ski village of Galtuer, near the Swiss border, where local rescue workers spent the night digging through walls of snow and rubble for survivors. At least 30 people, some of them critically injured, were dug out by evening, Austrian television said.",
				"The fiercest snowstorms in 50 years set off massive avalanches all across the Alps in recent weeks, killing dozens of residents and ski vacationers in France, Switzerland, Italy and Austria. In Switzerland, officials said the death toll over the weekend had risen to seven. Houses, railroads and highways were buried by avalanches. Tens of thousands of tourists were stranded in some of northern Europe's most fashionable resorts.",
				"In Galtuer, a town of 700 year-round inhabitants and about 3,000 tourists in Tyrol Province's Paznaun Valley, the avalanche thundered though the heart of town near the village church at 4:00 p.m. instantly crushing four houses.",
				"The village, which has no hospital, had been cut off from the outside world by heavy snows and high winds for nearly a week.",
				"``We were drinking hot mulled wine, when suddenly it started'' Franz Wenko, a hotel operator in Galtuer, told Austrian television. ``he lights went out. It was dark. There was only dust and snow. We got out of there as fast as we could.''",
				"Maj. Thomas Schoenherr of the Austrian army, told Austrian radio on Tuesday evening that about 55 people were feared missing in Galtuer. Other estimates varied. Some officials said 20 to 30 people were still missing. Another government spokesman said that only ``a few'' were unaccounted for.",
				"Austrian army helicopters remained grounded in the town of Landeck, about 20 miles from Galtuer, overnight. Schoenherr said, ``We will meet again at 6 a.m. to assess what we can do.''",
				"Inside the village, witnesses said the residents were digging for survivors. ``Some 300 people are looking for buried people in the mass of snow,'' Lufwig Walter, a ski instructor, told the Austrian Press Agency. Walter said that in some parts of the village, snow was 17 feet high. ``There's no let-up,'' he said, referring to the rescue effort.",
				"A doctor, who is believed to be the only one in the village, told an APA reporter by telephone, ``We are working in very basic conditions.'' Snow fell heavily overnight, and the news agency reported that another 20 inches were expected by Wednesday morning.",
				"All over Europe, the avalanches took lives and destroyed homes. A 35-year-old German woman was killed when a snowslide ploughed into a chalet in Sportsgastein, near Salzburg, Austria.",
				"In the ski village of Morgex, in northern Italy, a 52-year-old woman was killed when her house collapsed under an avalanche before daylight. Three others in the house survived, but she was killed when a steel beam pierced her chest.",
				"In Switzerland, teams of rescue workers searching for survivors found five more bodies on Tuesday, after an avalanche that crushed chalets near Evolene on Sunday. Four of the victims _ one a child _ were French tourists. The other was a 28-year-old local man. Three people were still missing as of Tuesday night.",
				"In France, blizzards hampered rescuers seeking French skiers and hikers missing in the Alps and the Pyrenees.",
				"In western Austria alone, about 20,000 tourists have been unable to leave their hotels since last Wednesday. So much snow had fallen over the last week that the Austrian Motoring Association complained that its density monitors had been buried, making it impossible to measure the snow fall. Swiss television reported that as many as 60,000 people were snowbound in the resorts of Davos and Klosters.",
				"In many parts of Europe, driving snow caused trains to be canceled. Highways were blocked or traffic was backed up for hours.",
				"The recent avalanches, labeled by some newspapers as ``the white death,'' were described as the largest and most terrifying in recent memory.",
				"`'I've seen many avalanches, but not the type that come into your house and blow it away,'' said Nathan Wallace, 28, from Mammoth Lakes, Calif., whose chalet near Chamonix was destroyed by an avalanche on Feb. 9. `'It was more like a California earthquake.''",
				"Wallace and his girlfriend, Alicia Boice, 21, were rescued two hours after the roof of their chalet collapsed. "

				"Independent Counsel Hearings Open",
				"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress should just let the independent counsel law expire since almost any effort to revise it so soon after President Clinton's impeachment acquittal ``is likely to be a mistake,'' former White House chief of staff Howard Baker told a Senate committee today. He spoke to the Governmental Affairs Committee at its opening hearing on whether to renew, rewrite or let the law die. The 1978 statute is due to expire June 30. President Clinton, meanwhile, declined to comment on the issue but told reporters that White House lawyers will testify on the matter next week.",
				"Kosovo's Ethnic Albanians Unite",
				"PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Kosovo's rival ethnic Albanian factions today formed a coalition to push harder to secede from Serbia. The surprise announcement came a day after Kosovo peace talks concluded without any breakthrough on a deal to end a year of fighting in the southern Serbian province. The announcement spelled success for a long-term American and European goal -- getting ethnic Albanians to speak with one voice.",
				"Clinton: U.S. Has Stake in Kosovo",
				"WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today the United States has an interest in resolving the Kosovo conflict. ``I would argue we have a humanitarian interest,'' he said. ``The United States does have a direct interest in whether there is instability in the Balkans,'' Clinton said. Clinton is considering sending up to 4,000 U.S. troops as part of a 28,000-strong NATO force that would go to Kosovo for at least three years if a peace plan were implemented.",
				"1 Dead in Avalanche in Austria",
				"LANDECK, Austria (AP) -- Helicopters rescued stranded tourists in western Austria and another killer avalanche brought new heartache today. The new avalanche struck just miles from where rescuers were digging for victims of Europe's worst snowslide this winter. The latest torrent of snow smashed into the town of Valzur, where a dead woman and three survivors were pulled from the snow and debris. Five people remained missing, the Austria Press Agency said. Seven miles away the death toll rose to 16 from an avalanche yesterday.",
				"Prejudice May Be Heart Care Factor",
				"NEW YORK (AP) -- Subconscious prejudices among doctors may help explain why women and blacks complaining of chest pain are less likely than men and whites to receive the best cardiac testing, a study suggests. A new study of 720 physicians found that, with all symptoms being equal, doctors were only 60 percent as likely to order cardiac catheterization for women and blacks as for men and whites. For black women, the doctors were only 40 percent as likely to order catheterization.",
				"Greenspan Warns About Minimum Wage",
				"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Raising the minimum wage could deny some teen-agers their chance at entry-level jobs, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said today. Delivering the Fed's semiannual economic report to Congress, Greenspan said increasing the wage probably would push inflation higher. President Clinton, in his State of the Union address last month, proposed raising the wage by $1 to $6.15 by September 2000.",
				"8th-Grader Takes Principal Hostage",
				"MARYVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- An eighth-grade boy with a gun took his principal hostage this afternoon, apparently after the principal tried to discipline him for carrying the weapon in school. Montvale Elementary School Principal Jim Ratledge was taken hostage in his office shortly after 2 p.m., a spokeswoman for the school system said. No shots had been fired and no one was reported hurt, she said.",
				"Calif. Man Convicted of 11 Murders",
				"SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- Charles Ng was convicted today of 11 counts of first-degree murder in a series of sex slavery killings dating to 1984 and 1985. The jury also found special circumstances of multiple murder that make Ng, a 38-year-old from Hong Kong, eligible for the death penalty, to be determined in a separate penalty phase of the trial.",
				"Stocks End Lower; Dow Off 144.75",
				"NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks closed lower today after bond prices slid and pushed interest rates higher. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 144.75 at 9,399.67. NYSE decliners led advancers 1,782-1,202. The Nasdaq was higher most of the day but ended 36.95 lower at 2,339.40.",
				"Lakers Fire Coach Del Harris",
				"INGLEWOOD, Calif. AP) -- The Los Angeles Lakers, mired at .500 12 games through the abbreviated NBA season, fired coach Del Harris today. Jerry West, the team's vice president of basketball operations, said that one of two assistants -- Kurt Rambis or Larry Drew -- will handle the coaching duties for the rest of the season. The team made the announcement as it was adding Dennis Rodman to what on paper is one of the more talented teams in the league.",

				"``We're doing everything humanly possible to rescue people,'' said Austrian army spokesman Maj. Thomas Schoenherr in Landeck.",

				"He said the United States, Germany and Switzerland had all offered to lend helicopters to the rescue efforts, and officials were evaluating how best to use them.",

Simpson, reached at home, said he was prepared to face another trial against his ex-wife's parents.",

				"LANDECK, Austria (AP) -- Another killer avalanche brought new heartache to Western Austria today, striking just miles from where rescuers were digging for victims of Europe's worst snowslide this winter. The latest torrent of snow smashed into the town of Valzur, where two people were killed and two survivors were pulled from the snow and debris. Seven miles away, in Galtuer, the death toll rose to 16, with 15 still missing.",

				"Military Pay Hike OK'd by Senate",
				"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate voted overwhelmingly today to give the nation's military the biggest benefits increase since the early 1980s. The legislation includes an across-the-board 4.8 percent pay increase with further boosts in future years. The nation has 1.4 million active-duty military members. Republican leaders said they wanted the first Senate bill passed this year to telegraph support for U.S. troops, particularly in light of a possible new deployment to Kosovo",
				"2000 Budget Might Exceed Limits",
				"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The new House speaker signaled today that Republicans might exceed spending limits enacted two years ago with President Clinton, placing the GOP in the ticklish position of evading strictures aimed at shrinking government. ``I'm not saying we're going to bust them or not bust them,'' Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., told reporters. Some top Republican aides went further, saying that in private consultations, the House GOP seemed to be moving toward surpassing the spending limits for fiscal 2000 by billions of dollars.",
				"GOP Energized Over N.Y. Senate Race",
				"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican fund-raisers seized on ``Hillary Clinton for Senate'' as their own rallying cry today as the first lady, undecided about a candidacy, summoned advice-givers to the White House family quarters. Whether she does or doesn't, the sheer specter of a run by Mrs. Clinton is enough to galvanize Republican donors, said Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Mrs. Clinton met in the White House family quarters today with New York Sen. Charles Schumer, New York Rep. Nita Lowey and New Jersey Sen. Robert Torricelli.",
				"Mexican Cartels Said Penetrating US",
				"WASHINGTON (AP) -- A top Drug Enforcement Administration official said today the Mexican narcotics cartels' penetration of the United States has increased dramatically. The statement by DEA Administrator Thomas Constantine comes just ahead of President Clinton's expected certification of Mexico's counter-drug effort. But Constantine, testifying to the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control, stopped short of saying Mexico should be decertified.",
				"Va. Bill Targets Some 'Junk' E-Mail",
				"RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Virginia is making criminals out of flagrant junk e-mailers with a new law to protect computer users from getting ``spammed.'' The legislation passed yesterday makes Virginia the fourth state in the country to pass an anti-spamming law and 18 others are considering them, said the National Conference of State Legislatures. Like Virginia, California's law allows for the jailing of some spammers while laws in Washington and Nevada impose civil fines.",

			"sentences":[
				"LANDECK, Austria _ With more snow covering the Alps than almost anyone could remember, Ulrike Schwarz came to the Austrian Alpine resort of Galtuer from her home in Germany last week with her two teen-age children, expecting the best skiing in years.",
				"Since last weekend, though, it had been snowing too hard to ski. So Mrs. Schwarz, her daughter, Solvieg, and her son, Christoph, were relaxing in bed on the third floor of their bed-and-breakfast chalet in the center of Galtuer at 4 p.m. Tuesday when, with an almighty rumbling, clouds of snow blasted through the windows and the whole house collapsed beneath them.",
				"``Avalanche!'' Mrs. Schwarz screamed, pushing the children toward the stairs in the back of the Tyrolean chalet, away from millions of tons of highly compressed snow carrying rocks and shredded trees and roaring down upon the village. All three survived, climbing out of the house through a hole where the roof had been, and were flown out to an emergency center in Landeck Wednesday afternoon.",
				"Authorities here said Wednesday that they had recovered the bodies of 16 people, many of them German vacationers, from the avalanche, which was 15 to 20 feet deep and 300 to 500 feet wide. They were still looking for 20 to 30 other missing people, feared dead under the snow.",
				"On Wednesday, 24 hours after the Tuesday avalanche, authorities said another snowslide, up to 45 feet deep and 600 feet wide, in the nearby resort of Ischgl had swept away four houses.",
				"Two people, a man and a little girl, were pulled alive from the snow Wednesday in Ischgl, but a woman was killed and six other people were believed missing, according to authorities and Austrian television.",
				"All told, the avalanches were the worst in Austria since a series of snowslides killed 56 people in the village of Blons in January 1954.",
				"With Galtuer and Ischgl cut off from road access Wednesday by the continuing danger of avalanches, information on the latest deadly slide was scarce. Maj. Thomas Schoenherr, an Austrian military spokesman, said rescuers in Galtuer had no way of making their way down the valley Wednesday afternoon to help after the most recent avalanche in Ischgl, but that others had been flown in by helicopter.",
				"``The snow is like cement and it's full of pieces of wood and wreckage,'' Schoenherr said.",
				"After heavy snows over the past two weeks set off avalanches that killed seven people near the southern Swiss village of Evolene and 19 people in France, the mood Wednesday at the height of this Alpine vacation season is edgy. The vacationing skiers and those who cater to them live for snow; now they are finding that they can also die from too much of it.",
				"Here in Landeck, more than 20 miles east of Galtuer, Austrian authorities turned a military barracks compound into an avalanche-emergency command center for evacuating people from the stricken resorts and sending in food and other supplies. They barred all civilian air or road traffic in the area. <ANNOTATION> (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) </ANNOTATION>",
				"Landeck and Galtuer are separated by mountains more than 8,000 to 10,000 feet high, fearsome, jagged peaks that, from the air Wednesday, looked softened and benign under their heavy coats of blinding white snow.",
				"On the ground, olive drab Austrian Huey helicopters beat their way down into the narrow landing field of the Landeck barracks compound for most of the day, taking out about 400 vacationers and villagers before a heavy snowfall late Wednesday afternoon halted the flights. Other choppers loaded up with meat, cabbage, potatoes, tomatoes and milk for the 7,500 tourists in Ischgl and the 600 ski vacationers still in Galtuer.",
				"The United States flew in six Blackhawk medical evacuation helicopters to Innsbrueck airport, 60 miles northeast of Galtuer, to help take people out, but they could not fly in Wednesday because of the afternoon snow, Schoenherr said.",
				"Austrian television showed video tape, apparently taken by the rescuers, showing dogs sniffing for survivors and long lines of rescuers plunging sticks into the snow and digging holes 6-to-10 feet deep in hopes of finding victims still alive.",
				"The tape showed solid three-story concrete and stucco Tyrolean houses torn apart as if by an earthquake, and automobiles rolled into crumpled metal balls by the snow.",
				"And it showed rescuers lifting frozen bodies out of the ice.",
				"``This is the most painful day of my life,'' said Wendelin Weingartner, the top elected official in the Austrian Tyrol region. Eight seriously injured victims were flown to hospitals in Innsbrueck, where they were all said to be in stable condition under treatment for hypothermia.",
				"European authorities explained the spate of avalanches by the almost unparalleled amounts of snow that have fallen since the second week of February and the high winds that have whipped it into drifts and made it unstable on the crust of earlier snow.",
				"Scores of other resorts in Austria, Switzerland and France have been cut off from road access for days by the mounting danger of avalanches. Places like Davos, Switzerland, where the high and mighty of the worlds of government, industry and finance congregated at a conference early this month, are now inaccessible by road or rail, and others, like the fashionable Austrian resorts of Lech and Zuers, another 60 miles west of here, have been cut off for more than a week.",
				"Yet almost all the resorts have Web sites or television advertisements that boast of fantastic ski conditions, and most are clearly expecting a new infusion of guests as soon as the roads reopen.",
				"Mrs. Schwarz had a meal in the barracks mess hall after her ordeal and waited for her husband to come from Germany to pick up the family.",
				"Would she or her children ever go skiing again? ``Yes, but not with this much snow,'' Mrs. Schwarz said. "
