                " LANDECK, Austria (AP) -- Austrian soldiers took advantage of a break in heavy snowfall today to mount a rescue of avalanche victims from a stricken Alpine town, joining villagers who dug with their bare hands in a frantic effort to reach those buried below.", 
                "The confirmed death toll from Tuesday's avalanche at Galtuer stood at 10 early today, but was expected to rise, provincial governor Wendelin Weingartner told reporters.", 
                "He said 31 people were still missing in the village in the Tyrol province, near the Swiss border.", 
                "Rescue workers have recovered at least 17 injured, seven of whom required intensive care.", 
                "They were being flown in by helicopter to the hospital in nearby Landeck, where rescue operations were headquartered ``We're doing everything humanly possible to rescue people,'' said Austrian army spokesman Maj. Thomas Schoenherr in Landeck.", 
                "He said that soon after daybreak, about a dozen helicopters ferried some 200 troops to the avalanche site and also carried some of the injured back to hospitals in Landeck, 25 miles away.", 
                "The main road into Galtuer was blocked by an earlier avalanche.", 
                "Children, some of whom had been playing in the streets when the snow rumbled over them, were among the dead.", 
                "Firefighters, tourists and residents joined in the search for survivors, some digging in the snow with their bare hands.", 
                "``It's a terrible day for Tyrol,'' Weingartner said Tuesday.", 
                "Schoenherr said that people caught in the open by the slide had little chance of surviving more than a few minutes but those trapped in their homes, where they had air to breathe, had a chance of surviving considerably longer.", 
                "He said the United States, Germany and Switzerland had all offered to lend helicopters to the rescue efforts, and officials were evaluating how best to use them.", 
                "The Galtuer avalanche was one of the worst to strike Central Europe this winter as the region continues to endure its heaviest snowfall in 50 years.", 
                "Tens of thousands of travelers were stranded in train stations, traffic jams and isolated resort towns across France, Italy Switzerland and Austria as the avalanches buried homes, roads and railways.", 
                "More than 60 people have died in avalanches in Europe this year.", 
                "In Austria's western Vorarlberg province, rescuers near Gargellen found a man and a woman Tuesday who were buried a day earlier when an avalanche swallowed a mountain restaurant, APA reported.", 
                "The man was still alive, but bad weather prevented an emergency flight to a hospital, and he died later of his injuries.", 
                "Where helicopters could fly, rescuers flew in food and tons of mail to entire valleys that had been cut off by heavy snow.", 
                "Some 20,000 tourists were stranded in Tyrol province, and thousands of others in Vorarlberg.", 
                "In northwestern Italy, a mass of snow and debris tore through the small village of Morgex on Tuesday, killing a 52-year-old woman in her home and injuring three others.", 
                "Over the border in the Swiss state of Valais, avalanches thundered down repeatedly into a mountain valley Tuesday, propelled by fresh snow and winds gusting up to 95 mph.", 
                "Rescuers in Evolene, Switzerland, found five more bodies Tuesday from avalanches on Sunday.", 
                "Three people were still missing. "

                " LANDECK, Austria _ With more snow covering the Alps than almost anyone could remember, Ulrike Schwarz came to the Austrian Alpine resort of Galtuer from her home in Germany last week with her two teen-age children, expecting the best skiing in years.", 
                "Since last weekend, though, it had been snowing too hard to ski.", 
                "So Mrs. Schwarz, her daughter, Solvieg, and her son, Christoph, were relaxing in bed on the third floor of their bed-and-breakfast chalet in the center of Galtuer at 4 p.m. Tuesday when, with an almighty rumbling, clouds of snow blasted through the windows and the whole house collapsed beneath them.", 
                "``Avalanche!", 
                "'' Mrs. Schwarz screamed, pushing the children toward the stairs in the back of the Tyrolean chalet, away from millions of tons of highly compressed snow carrying rocks and shredded trees and roaring down upon the village.", 
                "All three survived, climbing out of the house through a hole where the roof had been, and were flown out to an emergency center in Landeck Wednesday afternoon.", 
                "Authorities here said Wednesday that they had recovered the bodies of 16 people, many of them German vacationers, from the avalanche, which was 15 to 20 feet deep and 300 to 500 feet wide.", 
                "They were still looking for 20 to 30 other missing people, feared dead under the snow.", 
                "On Wednesday, 24 hours after the Tuesday avalanche, authorities said another snowslide, up to 45 feet deep and 600 feet wide, in the nearby resort of Ischgl had swept away four houses.", 
                "Two people, a man and a little girl, were pulled alive from the snow Wednesday in Ischgl, but a woman was killed and six other people were believed missing, according to authorities and Austrian television.", 
                "All told, the avalanches were the worst in Austria since a series of snowslides killed 56 people in the village of Blons in January 1954.", 
                "With Galtuer and Ischgl cut off from road access Wednesday by the continuing danger of avalanches, information on the latest deadly slide was scarce.", 
                "Maj. Thomas Schoenherr, an Austrian military spokesman, said rescuers in Galtuer had no way of making their way down the valley Wednesday afternoon to help after the most recent avalanche in Ischgl, but that others had been flown in by helicopter.", 
                "``The snow is like cement and it's full of pieces of wood and wreckage,'' Schoenherr said.", 
                "After heavy snows over the past two weeks set off avalanches that killed seven people near the southern Swiss village of Evolene and 19 people in France, the mood Wednesday at the height of this Alpine vacation season is edgy.", 
                "The vacationing skiers and those who cater to them live for snow; now they are finding that they can also die from too much of it.", 
                "Here in Landeck, more than 20 miles east of Galtuer, Austrian authorities turned a military barracks compound into an avalanche-emergency command center for evacuating people from the stricken resorts and sending in food and other supplies.", 
                "They barred all civilian air or road traffic in the area.", 
                "<ANNOTATION> (STORY CAN END HERE.", 
                "OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) </ANNOTATION> Landeck and Galtuer are separated by mountains more than 8,000 to 10,000 feet high, fearsome, jagged peaks that, from the air Wednesday, looked softened and benign under their heavy coats of blinding white snow.", 
                "On the ground, olive drab Austrian Huey helicopters beat their way down into the narrow landing field of the Landeck barracks compound for most of the day, taking out about 400 vacationers and villagers before a heavy snowfall late Wednesday afternoon halted the flights.", 
                "Other choppers loaded up with meat, cabbage, potatoes, tomatoes and milk for the 7,500 tourists in Ischgl and the 600 ski vacationers still in Galtuer.", 
                "The United States flew in six Blackhawk medical evacuation helicopters to Innsbrueck airport, 60 miles northeast of Galtuer, to help take people out, but they could not fly in Wednesday because of the afternoon snow, Schoenherr said.", 
                "Austrian television showed video tape, apparently taken by the rescuers, showing dogs sniffing for survivors and long lines of rescuers plunging sticks into the snow and digging holes 6-to-10 feet deep in hopes of finding victims still alive.", 
                "The tape showed solid three-story concrete and stucco Tyrolean houses torn apart as if by an earthquake, and automobiles rolled into crumpled metal balls by the snow.", 
                "And it showed rescuers lifting frozen bodies out of the ice.", 
                "``This is the most painful day of my life,'' said Wendelin Weingartner, the top elected official in the Austrian Tyrol region.", 
                "Eight seriously injured victims were flown to hospitals in Innsbrueck, where they were all said to be in stable condition under treatment for hypothermia.", 
                "European authorities explained the spate of avalanches by the almost unparalleled amounts of snow that have fallen since the second week of February and the high winds that have whipped it into drifts and made it unstable on the crust of earlier snow.", 
                "Scores of other resorts in Austria, Switzerland and France have been cut off from road access for days by the mounting danger of avalanches.", 
                "Places like Davos, Switzerland, where the high and mighty of the worlds of government, industry and finance congregated at a conference early this month, are now inaccessible by road or rail, and others, like the fashionable Austrian resorts of Lech and Zuers, another 60 miles west of here, have been cut off for more than a week.", 
                "Yet almost all the resorts have Web sites or television advertisements that boast of fantastic ski conditions, and most are clearly expecting a new infusion of guests as soon as the roads reopen.", 
                "Mrs. Schwarz had a meal in the barracks mess hall after her ordeal and waited for her husband to come from Germany to pick up the family.", 
                "Would she or her children ever go skiing again?", 
                "``Yes, but not with this much snow,'' Mrs. Schwarz said. "
