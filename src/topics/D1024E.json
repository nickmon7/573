				"KHARTOUM, Sudan _ Not quite 24 hours after American cruise missiles hit a factory in a decrepit industrial area of this capital, clouds of white smoke and acrid smells still hovered over the site Friday night.",
				"About a dozen Sudanese soldiers lounged on the ground at the entrance of the destroyed factory, which the Sudanese say made pharmaceuticals, but which the Americans contend was a cover for the making of chemical weapons. Deep puddles of water on the muddy ground attested to the fire-fighting efforts after the strike.",
				"The Islamic government, accused by the Clinton administration of assisting in the terrorist activities of Osama bin Laden, used these fiery remnants of the factory as a backdrop for a well-organized anti-American demonstration during the day.",
				"After Friday prayers in the city's mosques, worshipers were urged to attend rallies, including a particularly vocal one at the plant, where leading figures of the government accused the United States of being a ``terrorist'' state.",
				"At one rally, pictures of President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky were on prominent display, a juxtaposition of a man and his mistress that is interpreted in this very conservative society as the ultimate mockery.",
				"Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail said that Sudan would remain a ``tomb for its enemies whatever this costs us in human lives.''",
				"But the most important Sudanese leader, Hassan al Turabi, who is the speaker of Parliament and the ideological power behind the ruling National Islamic Front, remained silent Friday. American intelligence officials have called Turabi a close comrade of bin Laden, whom the administration has accused of being the mastermind of the bombings of two American embassies in East Africa that left hundreds dead.",
				"Turabi has been a mysterious figure of the fundamentalist government, which grabbed power in the coup in 1989.",
				"Gen. Omar Hassan al-Bashir, the Sudanese president, made up for Turabi's silence. Bashir said that he would prove that the pharmaceutical plant hit by the American missiles was not a cover for making the precursors of nerve gas as Washington claimed. ``We have undeniable proof'' that the plant was only used for pharmaceutical products such as children's and anti-malarial medicines, he said. International companies that had provided equipment for the plant that opened two years ago would back him up, he added. The general did not name them.",
				"In describing the reasons for destroying the plant, Sandy Berger, Clinton's national security adviser, said bin Laden had given key financial help for the plant that was part of the ``Sudanese military industrial complex.'' Bin Laden lived in Sudan from 1994 to 1996, a period when Washington says he invited international terrorists to train at camps here.",
				"He was forced to leave Sudan in 1996 when the government decided that he was too much of an embarrassment and his presence too costly. After telling bin Laden to leave, the government hoped to win some concessions from the Clinton administration, including economic aid, but failed to do so.",
				"As part of its case that the plant was a benign operation, government officials said that it was owned by a Sudanese businessman, Salah Idrisse, who is also a citizen of Saudi Arabia.",
				"The heart of the factory where most of the smoke was still billowing was off bounds to reporters Friday and it was impossible to tell what was made there. In the rubble at the front of the compound were wrappers from a veterinary solution made at the plant and leaflets on how to take Profenil, a trade name for ibuprofen, a widely used pain reliever. Trays of small empty brown bottles, apparently used for medicine, were scattered about on the ground.",
				"Mohammed Hussein, 23, a builder who lives about a mile from the plant, said he saw bright lights and then heard the swoosh of about six missiles during the attack. At first, he thought the nearby power station had been struck, he said. Then he thought a plane had crashed. Then, he said, it occurred to him that John Garang, the leader of a southern rebel group that has been waging a civil war for more than a decade, had finally struck the capital.",
				"According to the plant's managing director, Sayed Hamed, the factory employed 360 workers. He said the enterprise made 30 varieties of drugs for humans, and 23 kinds of veterinary medicines. A hospital spokesman said earlier that 10 people wounded from the strike were admitted to the wards. Four of them were critically hurt, he said. The plant does not operate at night and there were apparently few workers around during the attack.",
				"A spokesman for Sudanese opposition political parties based in Cairo, Faruq Ahmed Adam, said he agreed with Washington that the plant was a cover for the manufacture of chemical weapons. He said that another factory in the suburb of Kafouri also made chemical weapons. He added that Sudanese security forces were investors in the plant.",
				"Relations between Washington and the Sudanese government have gone from bad to worse in the nine years of the fundamentalist regime. But even so, ordinary people seem to be bewildered why American should send cruise missiles here.",
				"Some said they were skeptical that the pharmaceutical plant was a cover for preparing chemical warfare agents. ``Most people here, even those who are anti-government, do not believe this particular factory was making chemical weapons,'' one man said.",
				"But another longtime opposition supporter, a lawyer, said he believed the Americans knew what they were doing. ``Bin Laden has never built a factory for medicines in his life,'' said the lawyer. ``He's only interested in killing and terrorism.'' &QL;"
