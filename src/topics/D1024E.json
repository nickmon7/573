                " KHARTOUM, Sudan _ Not quite 24 hours after American cruise missiles hit a factory in a decrepit industrial area of this capital, clouds of white smoke and acrid smells still hovered over the site Friday night.", 
                "About a dozen Sudanese soldiers lounged on the ground at the entrance of the destroyed factory, which the Sudanese say made pharmaceuticals, but which the Americans contend was a cover for the making of chemical weapons.", 
                "Deep puddles of water on the muddy ground attested to the fire-fighting efforts after the strike.", 
                "The Islamic government, accused by the Clinton administration of assisting in the terrorist activities of Osama bin Laden, used these fiery remnants of the factory as a backdrop for a well-organized anti-American demonstration during the day.", 
                "After Friday prayers in the city's mosques, worshipers were urged to attend rallies, including a particularly vocal one at the plant, where leading figures of the government accused the United States of being a ``terrorist'' state.", 
                "At one rally, pictures of President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky were on prominent display, a juxtaposition of a man and his mistress that is interpreted in this very conservative society as the ultimate mockery.", 
                "Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail said that Sudan would remain a ``tomb for its enemies whatever this costs us in human lives.", 
                "'' But the most important Sudanese leader, Hassan al Turabi, who is the speaker of Parliament and the ideological power behind the ruling National Islamic Front, remained silent Friday.", 
                "American intelligence officials have called Turabi a close comrade of bin Laden, whom the administration has accused of being the mastermind of the bombings of two American embassies in East Africa that left hundreds dead.", 
                "Turabi has been a mysterious figure of the fundamentalist government, which grabbed power in the coup in 1989.", 
                "Gen. Omar Hassan al-Bashir, the Sudanese president, made up for Turabi's silence.", 
                "Bashir said that he would prove that the pharmaceutical plant hit by the American missiles was not a cover for making the precursors of nerve gas as Washington claimed.", 
                "``We have undeniable proof'' that the plant was only used for pharmaceutical products such as children's and anti-malarial medicines, he said.", 
                "International companies that had provided equipment for the plant that opened two years ago would back him up, he added.", 
                "The general did not name them.", 
                "In describing the reasons for destroying the plant, Sandy Berger, Clinton's national security adviser, said bin Laden had given key financial help for the plant that was part of the ``Sudanese military industrial complex.", 
                "'' Bin Laden lived in Sudan from 1994 to 1996, a period when Washington says he invited international terrorists to train at camps here.", 
                "He was forced to leave Sudan in 1996 when the government decided that he was too much of an embarrassment and his presence too costly.", 
                "After telling bin Laden to leave, the government hoped to win some concessions from the Clinton administration, including economic aid, but failed to do so.", 
                "As part of its case that the plant was a benign operation, government officials said that it was owned by a Sudanese businessman, Salah Idrisse, who is also a citizen of Saudi Arabia.", 
                "The heart of the factory where most of the smoke was still billowing was off bounds to reporters Friday and it was impossible to tell what was made there.", 
                "In the rubble at the front of the compound were wrappers from a veterinary solution made at the plant and leaflets on how to take Profenil, a trade name for ibuprofen, a widely used pain reliever.", 
                "Trays of small empty brown bottles, apparently used for medicine, were scattered about on the ground.", 
                "Mohammed Hussein, 23, a builder who lives about a mile from the plant, said he saw bright lights and then heard the swoosh of about six missiles during the attack.", 
                "At first, he thought the nearby power station had been struck, he said.", 
                "Then he thought a plane had crashed.", 
                "Then, he said, it occurred to him that John Garang, the leader of a southern rebel group that has been waging a civil war for more than a decade, had finally struck the capital.", 
                "According to the plant's managing director, Sayed Hamed, the factory employed 360 workers.", 
                "He said the enterprise made 30 varieties of drugs for humans, and 23 kinds of veterinary medicines.", 
                "A hospital spokesman said earlier that 10 people wounded from the strike were admitted to the wards.", 
                "Four of them were critically hurt, he said.", 
                "The plant does not operate at night and there were apparently few workers around during the attack.", 
                "A spokesman for Sudanese opposition political parties based in Cairo, Faruq Ahmed Adam, said he agreed with Washington that the plant was a cover for the manufacture of chemical weapons.", 
                "He said that another factory in the suburb of Kafouri also made chemical weapons.", 
                "He added that Sudanese security forces were investors in the plant.", 
                "Relations between Washington and the Sudanese government have gone from bad to worse in the nine years of the fundamentalist regime.", 
                "But even so, ordinary people seem to be bewildered why American should send cruise missiles here.", 
                "Some said they were skeptical that the pharmaceutical plant was a cover for preparing chemical warfare agents.", 
                "``Most people here, even those who are anti-government, do not believe this particular factory was making chemical weapons,'' one man said.", 
                "But another longtime opposition supporter, a lawyer, said he believed the Americans knew what they were doing.", 
                "``Bin Laden has never built a factory for medicines in his life,'' said the lawyer.", 
                "``He's only interested in killing and terrorism.",

                " CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi _ still on crutches from a recent hip operation _ led hundreds of chanting Libyans in a Friday rally condemning U.S. missile strikes on Sudan and Afghanistan.", 
                "``Down, Down USA!", 
                "'' and ``God is Great, Oh Sudan!", 
                "'' the crowd chanted as Gadhafi punched the air with his fist in Martyrs' Square in the Libyan capital Tripoli.", 
                "The sentiment was echoed around the Middle East, where leaders and many citizens roundly criticized Thursday's American attacks on a factory in Sudan and camps associated with Muslim radical Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan.", 
                "Much of the harshest criticism came from countries opposed to the United States, but even in perceived U.S. allies like Saudi Arabia, some people said the attack would add to and not lessen the threat against Americans.", 
                "U.S. President Clinton said the strikes were ordered to avenge the Aug. 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in East Africa and because of reports that more anti-American attacks were being planned.", 
                "U.S. officials said the factory in Sudan made chemical weapons agents; Sudan maintains it's a pharmaceutical plant.", 
                "Clinton's actions were widely seen by Arabs as an effort to distract public opinion in the United States from his travails over a relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.", 
                "``Clinton tries to cover up his scandal with attacks against Sudan and Afghanistan,'' the main headline in the leftist As-Safir daily in Lebanon said.", 
                "A front-page editorial in Beirut's Al Kifah Al Arabi paper said that ``Lewinsky's dress is no longer the preoccupation of the world after Clinton has discovered Osama bin Laden's dishdasha (Arab robe).", 
                "'' In Saudi Arabia, Abeer Hamza, a 26-year-old homemaker, said the American campaign ``is not self-defense, this is a senseless action.", 
                "'' She added: ``This violence will only beget more violence.", 
                "'' Mohammed al-Turki, a Saudi visiting the neighboring island of Bahrain, criticized Clinton but added that bin Laden _ who is himself a Saudi was ``no better.", 
                "'' In Cairo, Shaaban Ahmed Mohammed, 34, owner of a newspaper stand, was among a minority who said he believed the United States attacks were justified.", 
                "``It has the right to protect itself.", 
                "If it remains silent after the last attack (in Kenya and Tanzania) it will be the victim of numerous blows,'' he said.",

                " CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ In mosques and in McDonald's, Arabs on Friday criticized U.S. missile strikes in Sudan and Afghanistan as driven more by President Bill Clinton's need to escape scandal than by a battle against terrorism.", 
                "Many said, too, that the attacks would only increase hatred and violence by Muslims against the United States.", 
                "Even among the few Arabs interviewed who defended the U.S. attacks, some questioned whether the targeted Sudanese factory really made chemical weapons ``precursors'' as U.S. officials say _ or medicines as Sudan maintains.", 
                "``The U.S. ... has the right to defend its interests, but it must be certain,'' said Egyptian airline clerk Somaya Farouk, 23.", 
                "``If there was a 1 percent chance that this was a pharmaceuticals plant, then it should have held off.", 
                "'' Clinton said the missiles hit terrorist camps in Afghanistan run by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi millionaire blamed by Washington for the Aug. 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, and a factory linked to bin Laden in Sudan.", 
                "The reaction to the attacks from U.S. opponents in the Middle East was predictable, and American allies mostly remained silent.", 
                "The Cairo-based Arab League condemned the attack in Sudan, calling it ``an unjustified and flagrant aggression on ... an Arab country.", 
                "'' Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi _ still on crutches from a hip operation _ led a protest early Friday in the capital Tripoli, thrusting his fist in the air and shouting, ``Down, down USA.", 
                "'' The strikes were harshly criticized by both Iraq and non-Arab Iran which _ along with Libya and Sudan _ are on the U.S. list of terrorist sponsoring states.", 
                "``We condemn terrorism, but nothing justifies these attacks, especially these random American attacks against Muslim nations,'' Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi told state-run radio.", 
                "In newspapers, and from Arabs on the street, the repeated theme was that Clinton ordered the attacks to draw the spotlight off his affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.", 
                "Reading a newspaper in a McDonald's branch in Bahrain, 25-year-old Saudi citizen Mohammed al-Turki called the American missile strikes ``a plot to divert public attention from Clinton's wrongdoings.", 
                "'' But asked if he sympathized with bin Laden, he said ``he's no better.", 
                "'' Shaaban Ahmed Mohammed, 34, owner of a Cairo newspaper stand, was the only Arab interviewed who saw the strikes by the United States as likely to decrease, not spur, violence.", 
                "``It has the right to protect itself.", 
                "If it remains silent after the last attack (in Kenya and Tanzania), it will be the victim of numerous blows,'' he said.", 
                "More typical was the view of Hussein Rashid, 41, a bookkeeper from the sprawling Cairo neighborhood of Boulaq.", 
                "``When you wash your hands in blood repeatedly, they will never be clean,'' he said.", 
                "``Clinton and the U.S have for years been killing indiscriminately, so this is not new.", 
                "But it certainly won't go unanswered by the Muslim world.",

                "Sudanese who poured to the rally from Friday prayers at the city's mosques chanted ``Down, Down USA!",

                "The Security Council was expected to take up the matter on Monday, council sources said Friday.", 
                "Washington's justification that Thursday's bombing raids were an act of self-defense were ``very naive, lacking in logic and baseless because Sudan did not carry out any act or threat against the United States,'' said a letter from the state minister at the ministry of external relations.", 
                "The minister, H.E.", 
                "Bishop Gobrial Roric, urged the council to ``condemn this barbaric, unjust aggression and make the United States responsible for the human and material damage.", 
                "'' The letter, sent to council president Danilo Turk of Slovenia, was intended to lodge Sudan's formal complaint that Thursday's U.S. airstrikes on a Khartoum pharmaceutical factory were a breach of the U.N. charter and a violation of its sovereignty.", 
                "U.S. officials have said they were targeting a terrorist chemical plant linked to a suspect in the U.S. embassy bombings in east Africa.", 
                "Bahrain, the lone Arab on the council, was expected to raise the issue at the council meeting Monday.", 
                "The Arab Group of states and another group of Islamic states met Friday at the United Nations to express support for Sudan's effort.", 
                "The United States hadn't decided what it's response would be, said a U.S. official.", 
                "U.S. forces carried out the strikes in retaliation for the bombings at U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, which killed over 250 people.", 
                "U.S. officials have said the cruise missile attack on the Khartoum factory was designed to wipe out a terrorist chemical plant linked to Osama bin Laden, whom U.S. officials accuse in the embassy bombings.", 
                "In his four-page letter, Roric denied that bin Laden owns the pharmaceutical factory and described accusations that the factory produces chemical weapons as ``untrue,'' adding ``the United States government does not have evidence.", 
                "'' The United Nations confirmed Friday that it had contracted the el-Shifa plant to supply 100,000 liters of veterinary pharmaceuticals for Iraq under the oil-for-food program.", 
                "The pharmaceuticals haven't been delivered, U.N. officials said.", 
                "Roric called for an ``emergency Security Council meeting to discuss this aggression, and send a technical fact-finding mission to investigate the American claims and take the necessary measures to guarantee (the attack) won't be repeated and guarantee the safety and security of my country.", 
                "'' Sudan's efforts to rally an investigation came as Pakistan criticized Washington for acting unilaterally for what it said was an international problem.", 
                "``The problem here is not the right of self-defense.",

                "'' In a statement, Sudan's mission said ``the aggression is a flagrant violation to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Sudan,'' that violated Article 2 of the U.N. charter, which says member states must refrain from using force against other states.", 
                "U.S.", 
                "Ambassador Bill Richardson defended the air strikes in a letter Thursday to Turk that said the moves complied with the rights of states to self-defense as enshrined in the U.N. charter and international law.", 
                "He cited Article 51 of the U.N. charter, which states have the right to self-defense if attacked.", 
                "Afghanistan's U.N. ambassador, Raban Farhadi, in an interview with the AP called for a formal investigation into the strikes and was consulting with council members to raise the issue before the council.", 
                "``We insist on the necessity of diplomatic action because military action may lead to harming civilians,'' said Farhadi, who represents the ousted government of President Burhanuddin Rabbani, ousted by the Taliban in 1996. "
