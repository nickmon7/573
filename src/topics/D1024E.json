				" KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Hundreds of Sudanese trudged through the mud on a rainy Friday to gather by the twisted rubble and concrete of the factory heavily damaged by U.S. missiles. Civilians in trucks heading toward the plant chanted ``Down USA'' in English. White smoke still rose from the rubble of the four-story building, which the United States said was making chemical weapons agents. Many of the people said they were shocked that the United States struck a factory in the heart of the capital. Police tried to block many of the civilians, mostly women and children, from entering the factory compound. ``Are these people crazy? Do you think this is really a weapons factory?'' said a young woman who worked at the factory. She refused to give her name. Officials at Khartoum Teaching hospital said 10 people were injured in the raid, including four in critical condition. Workers at the site said they feared that some people may be trapped under the debris. Early Friday, Sudanese demonstrators stormed the empty U.S. Embassy compound in Khartoum and pulled down the American flag to protest the attack. The State Department ordered local staff to leave the U.S. Embassy after the Aug. 7 bombings of embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es-Salaam. American diplomats were pulled out of Khartoum in 1996. Sudanese officials charged that President Clinton ordered the missile attack to distract attention from his troubles in the Monica Lewinsky sex case. President Omar el-Bashir said on state-run Sudan Television that Clinton was a ``liar and morally decrepit.'' He said Sudan was recalling its diplomats from Washington. He also warned that Sudan ``reserves the right to respond to the American attack using all necessary measures,'' Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported Friday. ``We will retain the right to protest, and will ask the Security Council to investigate the truth ... about this factory,'' el-Bashir said on Sudanese television. He said he would call for an emergency meeting of the council to discuss the U.S. attack and asked U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to send a delegation to Sudan to investigate whether the plant was used to produce chemical weapons. The television said the factory produced about 50 percent of the country's pharmaceuticals. &UR; El-Bashir also, 14th graf &UR; pvs-lm-ggl "

				"KHARTOUM, Sudan _ Not quite 24 hours after American cruise missiles hit a factory in a decrepit industrial area of this capital, clouds of white smoke and acrid smells still hovered over the site Friday night.",
				"About a dozen Sudanese soldiers lounged on the ground at the entrance of the destroyed factory, which the Sudanese say made pharmaceuticals, but which the Americans contend was a cover for the making of chemical weapons. Deep puddles of water on the muddy ground attested to the fire-fighting efforts after the strike.",
				"The Islamic government, accused by the Clinton administration of assisting in the terrorist activities of Osama bin Laden, used these fiery remnants of the factory as a backdrop for a well-organized anti-American demonstration during the day.",
				"After Friday prayers in the city's mosques, worshipers were urged to attend rallies, including a particularly vocal one at the plant, where leading figures of the government accused the United States of being a ``terrorist'' state.",
				"At one rally, pictures of President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky were on prominent display, a juxtaposition of a man and his mistress that is interpreted in this very conservative society as the ultimate mockery.",
				"Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail said that Sudan would remain a ``tomb for its enemies whatever this costs us in human lives.''",
				"But the most important Sudanese leader, Hassan al Turabi, who is the speaker of Parliament and the ideological power behind the ruling National Islamic Front, remained silent Friday. American intelligence officials have called Turabi a close comrade of bin Laden, whom the administration has accused of being the mastermind of the bombings of two American embassies in East Africa that left hundreds dead.",
				"Turabi has been a mysterious figure of the fundamentalist government, which grabbed power in the coup in 1989.",
				"Gen. Omar Hassan al-Bashir, the Sudanese president, made up for Turabi's silence. Bashir said that he would prove that the pharmaceutical plant hit by the American missiles was not a cover for making the precursors of nerve gas as Washington claimed. ``We have undeniable proof'' that the plant was only used for pharmaceutical products such as children's and anti-malarial medicines, he said. International companies that had provided equipment for the plant that opened two years ago would back him up, he added. The general did not name them.",
				"In describing the reasons for destroying the plant, Sandy Berger, Clinton's national security adviser, said bin Laden had given key financial help for the plant that was part of the ``Sudanese military industrial complex.'' Bin Laden lived in Sudan from 1994 to 1996, a period when Washington says he invited international terrorists to train at camps here.",
				"He was forced to leave Sudan in 1996 when the government decided that he was too much of an embarrassment and his presence too costly. After telling bin Laden to leave, the government hoped to win some concessions from the Clinton administration, including economic aid, but failed to do so.",
				"As part of its case that the plant was a benign operation, government officials said that it was owned by a Sudanese businessman, Salah Idrisse, who is also a citizen of Saudi Arabia.",
				"The heart of the factory where most of the smoke was still billowing was off bounds to reporters Friday and it was impossible to tell what was made there. In the rubble at the front of the compound were wrappers from a veterinary solution made at the plant and leaflets on how to take Profenil, a trade name for ibuprofen, a widely used pain reliever. Trays of small empty brown bottles, apparently used for medicine, were scattered about on the ground.",
				"Mohammed Hussein, 23, a builder who lives about a mile from the plant, said he saw bright lights and then heard the swoosh of about six missiles during the attack. At first, he thought the nearby power station had been struck, he said. Then he thought a plane had crashed. Then, he said, it occurred to him that John Garang, the leader of a southern rebel group that has been waging a civil war for more than a decade, had finally struck the capital.",
				"According to the plant's managing director, Sayed Hamed, the factory employed 360 workers. He said the enterprise made 30 varieties of drugs for humans, and 23 kinds of veterinary medicines. A hospital spokesman said earlier that 10 people wounded from the strike were admitted to the wards. Four of them were critically hurt, he said. The plant does not operate at night and there were apparently few workers around during the attack.",
				"A spokesman for Sudanese opposition political parties based in Cairo, Faruq Ahmed Adam, said he agreed with Washington that the plant was a cover for the manufacture of chemical weapons. He said that another factory in the suburb of Kafouri also made chemical weapons. He added that Sudanese security forces were investors in the plant.",
				"Relations between Washington and the Sudanese government have gone from bad to worse in the nine years of the fundamentalist regime. But even so, ordinary people seem to be bewildered why American should send cruise missiles here.",
				"Some said they were skeptical that the pharmaceutical plant was a cover for preparing chemical warfare agents. ``Most people here, even those who are anti-government, do not believe this particular factory was making chemical weapons,'' one man said.",
				"But another longtime opposition supporter, a lawyer, said he believed the Americans knew what they were doing. ``Bin Laden has never built a factory for medicines in his life,'' said the lawyer. ``He's only interested in killing and terrorism.'' &QL; "

The sentiment was echoed around the Middle East, where leaders and many citizens roundly criticized Thursday's American attacks on a factory in Sudan and camps associated with Muslim radical Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan. Much of the harshest criticism came from countries opposed to the United States, but even in perceived U.S. allies like Saudi Arabia, some people said the attack would add to and not lessen the threat against Americans. U.S. President Clinton said the strikes were ordered to avenge the Aug. 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in East Africa and because of reports that more anti-American attacks were being planned. U.S. officials said the factory in Sudan made chemical weapons agents; Sudan maintains it's a pharmaceutical plant. Clinton's actions were widely seen by Arabs as an effort to distract public opinion in the United States from his travails over a relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. ``Clinton tries to cover up his scandal with attacks against Sudan and Afghanistan,'' the main headline in the leftist As-Safir daily in Lebanon said. A front-page editorial in Beirut's Al Kifah Al Arabi paper said that ``Lewinsky's dress is no longer the preoccupation of the world after Clinton has discovered Osama bin Laden's dishdasha (Arab robe).'' In Saudi Arabia, Abeer Hamza, a 26-year-old homemaker, said the American campaign ``is not self-defense, this is a senseless action.'' She added: ``This violence will only beget more violence.'' Mohammed al-Turki, a Saudi visiting the neighboring island of Bahrain, criticized Clinton but added that bin Laden _ who is himself a Saudi was ``no better.'' In Cairo, Shaaban Ahmed Mohammed, 34, owner of a newspaper stand, was among a minority who said he believed the United States attacks were justified. ``It has the right to protect itself. If it remains silent after the last attack (in Kenya and Tanzania) it will be the victim of numerous blows,'' he said. Kuwaiti Najeeb, 12th graf pvs &UR; vars-ggl "

				" KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ President Omar el-Bashir on Friday recalled Sudan's diplomats from Washington to protest the U.S. missile strike on a factory in the Sudanese capital a day earlier. After an emergency meeting with his Cabinet, el-Bashir also announced that Sudan would file complaints with the United Nations, the Arab League and the Organization of African Unity. He said Sudan could ``prove that the factory is specifically for pharmaceutical production'' and not the chemical weapons facility described by U.S. officials. El-Bashir later spoke at a rally outside his office. Sudanese who poured to the rally from Friday prayers at the city's mosques chanted ``Down, Down USA!'' and burned an American flag. The final casualty toll in the missile strike remained unclear. Khartoum Hospital officials said 10 people were being treated for injuries, including four in critical condition. Workers at the site said there was still concern that some victims could be buried under the rubble. They told The Associated Press that the factory's janitor and his family still hadn't been accounted for. Sidahmed Hajj Hamad, administrative director at the factory, estimated the damage at dlrs 100 million. Clinton ordered the attack on the factory in Khartoum in retaliation for the Aug. 7 bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. U.S. missiles also struck suspected camps of Muslim militant Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan. El-Bashir said that the factory _ the El-Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries Co. in the North Khartoum neighborhood _ was hit by six Tomahawk missiles. He said a seventh fell short of the target but did not indicate if it did any damage. State-run Sudan television said that the factory, which opened in 1996, produced about half of the country's medicines. Its main products were reported to be antibiotics and drugs to treat malaria and tuberculosis. Sudan continued to charge that Clinton took the action to divert public attention from the grand jury investigation into his relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. A statement issued by the Sudanese Embassy in the Kenyan capital Nairobi said that ``the timing was chosen to serve the wish of a sexual pervert and maniac to divert attention away from his crumbling credibility and reputation.'' The podium at the rally el-Bashir addressed was decorated with pictures of Clinton and Lewinsky and bore the slogan ``Clinton: Screw Monica, not Sudan.'' El-Bashir said that ``Clinton and America will have to pay. ... Sudan is for Islam, and we will not be bullied by Americans.'' He pledged to ``pursue all diplomatic channels'' over the missile attack but also said the government was ``opening all training camps'' for volunteers for the national militia. Overnight, Sudanese demonstrators stormed the empty U.S. Embassy compound in Khartoum and pulled down the American flag to protest the attack. The State Department ordered local staff to leave the U.S. Embassy after the bombings of embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es-Salaam two weeks ago. American diplomats were pulled out of Khartoum in 1996. Earlier in the day, hundreds of Sudanese trudged through streets made muddy with rain to view the twisted steel and concrete rubble of the four-story factory. Police tried to block the civilians, mostly women and children, from entering the factory compound. ``Are these people crazy? Do you think this is really a weapons factory?'' said a young woman who worked at the factory. She refused to give her name. &UR; mo-eap "

				" CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ In mosques and in McDonald's, Arabs on Friday criticized U.S. missile strikes in Sudan and Afghanistan as driven more by President Bill Clinton's need to escape scandal than by a battle against terrorism. Many said, too, that the attacks would only increase hatred and violence by Muslims against the United States. Even among the few Arabs interviewed who defended the U.S. attacks, some questioned whether the targeted Sudanese factory really made chemical weapons ``precursors'' as U.S. officials say _ or medicines as Sudan maintains. ``The U.S. ... has the right to defend its interests, but it must be certain,'' said Egyptian airline clerk Somaya Farouk, 23. ``If there was a 1 percent chance that this was a pharmaceuticals plant, then it should have held off.'' Clinton said the missiles hit terrorist camps in Afghanistan run by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi millionaire blamed by Washington for the Aug. 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, and a factory linked to bin Laden in Sudan. The reaction to the attacks from U.S. opponents in the Middle East was predictable, and American allies mostly remained silent. The Cairo-based Arab League condemned the attack in Sudan, calling it ``an unjustified and flagrant aggression on ... an Arab country.'' Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi _ still on crutches from a hip operation _ led a protest early Friday in the capital Tripoli, thrusting his fist in the air and shouting, ``Down, down USA.'' The strikes were harshly criticized by both Iraq and non-Arab Iran which _ along with Libya and Sudan _ are on the U.S. list of terrorist sponsoring states. ``We condemn terrorism, but nothing justifies these attacks, especially these random American attacks against Muslim nations,'' Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi told state-run radio. In newspapers, and from Arabs on the street, the repeated theme was that Clinton ordered the attacks to draw the spotlight off his affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Reading a newspaper in a McDonald's branch in Bahrain, 25-year-old Saudi citizen Mohammed al-Turki called the American missile strikes ``a plot to divert public attention from Clinton's wrongdoings.'' But asked if he sympathized with bin Laden, he said ``he's no better.'' Shaaban Ahmed Mohammed, 34, owner of a Cairo newspaper stand, was the only Arab interviewed who saw the strikes by the United States as likely to decrease, not spur, violence. ``It has the right to protect itself. If it remains silent after the last attack (in Kenya and Tanzania), it will be the victim of numerous blows,'' he said. More typical was the view of Hussein Rashid, 41, a bookkeeper from the sprawling Cairo neighborhood of Boulaq. ``When you wash your hands in blood repeatedly, they will never be clean,'' he said. ``Clinton and the U.S have for years been killing indiscriminately, so this is not new. But it certainly won't go unanswered by the Muslim world.'' "

				" UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Sudan will ask the Security Council to consider authorizing a U.N. investigation into the U.S. airstrikes on a Khartoum factory, Sudan's ambassador said Friday, calling the attack a breach of international law. Ambassador Elfatih Mohamed Ahmed Erwa said he would deliver a letter of formal complaint requesting the investigation later Friday to the council president, Danilo Turk of Slovenia. The letter was from Sudan's foreign minister, Erwa said. The Arab Group of states would support Sudan's request for an investigation, said Ali Sulaiman R. al-Saeid, the deputy ambassador of Kuwait. The group, chaired by Kuwait, met Friday to discuss Sudan's options. Non-aligned states were also meeting Friday and Sudan hoped they would support the investigation as well, Erwa said in an interview with The Associated Press. U.S. forces carried out the strikes in retaliation for the bombings at U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, which killed over 250 people. In a statement, Sudan's mission said ``the aggression is a flagrant violation to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Sudan,'' that violated Article 2 of the U.N. charter, which says member states must refrain from using force against other states. U.S. officials have said the cruise missile attack on the Khartoum factory was designed to wipe out a terrorist chemical plant linked to Osama bin Laden, whom U.S. officials accuse in the embassy bombings. Erwa told the Arab Group on Friday that the factory was a pharmaceutical plant that had no links to bin Laden. The United Nations confirmed Friday that it had contracted the el-Shifa plant to supply 100,000 liters of veterinary pharmaceuticals for Iraq under the oil-for-food program. The pharmaceuticals haven't been delivered, U.N. officials said. Sudan's efforts to rally an investigation came as Pakistan criticized Washington for acting unilaterally on what it described as an international problem. ``The problem here is not the right of self-defense. It is how the scourge of terrorism can best be eliminated from the world,'' said Pakistan's U.N. ambassador, Ahmad Kamal. ``And that requires an international consensus and that requires all of us sitting on the same side of the table.'' U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson defended the air strikes in a letter Thursday to Turk that said the moves complied with the rights of states to self-defense as enshrined in the U.N. charter and international law. Repeated threats by Bin Laden's terrorist organization left Washington ``no choice but to use armed force to prevent these attacks from continuing,'' Richardson wrote. He cited Article 51 of the U.N. charter, which states that nothing ``shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a member of the United Nations.'' China's U.N. ambassador, Shen Guofang, said Beijing was waiting for more information before deciding whether the United States had violated any U.N. norms. Secretary-General Kofi Annan spoke to U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright about the raids Thursday by phone from Mali, where Annan is vacationing, Eckhard said. Annan repeated his condemnation of terrorism and said the attacks on the U.S. embassies ``illustrate the need for the international community to come together to combat this menace,'' Eckhard said. "

				" KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Diplomats from more than a dozen nations were taken on a tour Friday of the Sudanese factory struck a day earlier by U.S. missiles. Firemen still rushed about, their faces covered with surgical masks to keep out the smell of burning plastic as they tried to put out blazes that persisted more than 24 hours after the attack. ``We ask the American people to push their government to stop interfering in our internal affairs,'' said Bishop Gabriel Rorej, minister of state for foreign affairs who showed the diplomats around. ``We are innocent people, and we renounce terrorism, and we are not a safe haven for terrorists and we will never be so.'' President Clinton ordered the attack on the El-Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries Co. on Thursday on grounds the factory was producing precursors for the deadly VX chemical weapon. American missiles also struck suspected bases of Muslim extremist Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan. The factory complex is in an industrial zone that is surrounded by mud and brick houses, mainly for factory workers. At least three dozen anti-riot police guarded the road leading to the site to try to keep away gawkers. The pharmaceutical factory complex consists of a half-dozen buildings, two of which _ a cafeteria and a storage building _ were still smoldering on Friday. Two floors of the four-story administration building were flattened in the missile attack, and half of the main two-story factory was destroyed. A warehouse also sustained heavy damage from a missile hit. One missile that landed between buildings left a crater about 2 meters (yards) in diameter and two meters deep. It was quickly filling up with water from the fire-fighting efforts. Pills, smashed plastic medicine bottles and paper cartons were scattered over the ground, along with concrete rubble and shards of glass. Sidahmed Hajj Hamad, administrative director at El-Shifa, estimated the damage to the 2-year-old factory at dlrs 100 million. He said the owner was Sudanese businessman Salah-Eddin Ahmed Idriss, who lives in Saudi Arabia. He described El-Shifa as ``the largest pharmaceutical factory we had in this country'' and added: ``We never produced any chemical material.'' As the diplomats toured, about 100 Sudanese women _ most in the head scarves of devout Muslims _ protested outside the factory gate, shouting ``America should be destroyed!'' and ``The factory should be rebuilt!'' Khadisha Ali, a sophomore from an Islamic university who led the chanting, told The Associated Press: ``We condemn this American aggression on our country. We call on the world community to come to the aid of Sudan.'' "

				" BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail asked the United States on Friday to send a fact-finding committee to inspect the alleged chemical weapons factory in Khartoum. The foreign minister spoke to reporters after arriving in Baghdad a day after U.S. missiles devastated a factory in the Sudanese capital. The United States said the plant produced the ingredients of chemical weapons. Sudan said it produced pharmaceutical products. ``We, as Sudanese, are ready to receive a specialized committee from the American administration to come and freely investigate whether this factory ... has anything to do with chemical (weapons),'' Ismail said. Such a committee could also check whether the factory was owned by Osama Bin Laden, the Afghanistan-based extremist whom the Americans have blamed for the bombings of its embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on Aug. 7, the foreign minister said. If the Americans proved the factory was producing chemical agents, ``we will accept the attempt (attack),'' Ismail added. Addressing the same press conference, Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf condemned Thursday's attack on the north Khartoum factory, in which hospital officials say 10 people were injured. The attack in Khartoum and the simultaneous strike on Bin Laden's camps in Afghanistan were a ``totally unwarranted act of aggression,'' al-Sahhaf said. ``They (the Americans) are behaving like international mercenaries.'' Ismail, who is making a three-day visit to Iraq, crossed into the country from Jordan. U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990 ban flights to and from Iraq. &UR; ms-jbm "

				" KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ President Omar el-Bashir launched a diplomatic offensive Friday to protest the U.S. missile strike on a factory in the Sudanese capital. After an emergency meeting with his Cabinet, el-Bashir said Sudan would file complaints with the United Nations, the Arab League and the Organization of African Unity. He said Sudan could ``prove that the factory is specifically for pharmaceutical production'' and not the chemical weapons facility described by U.S. officials. El-Bashir later spoke at a rally outside his office. Sudanese who poured to the rally from Friday prayers at the city's mosques chanted ``Down, Down USA!'' and burned an American flag. The final casualty toll in the missile strike remained unclear. Khartoum Hospital officials said 10 people were being treated for injuries, including four in critical condition. Workers at the site said there was still concern that some victims could be buried under the rubble. They told The Associated Press that the factory's janitor and his family still hadn't been accounted for. Sidahmed Hajj Hamad, administrative director at the factory, estimated the damage at dlrs 100 million. Clinton ordered the attack on the factory in Khartoum in retaliation for the Aug. 7 bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. U.S. missiles also struck suspected camps of Muslim militant Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan. El-Bashir said that the factory _ the El-Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries Co. in the North Khartoum neighborhood _ was hit by six Tomahawk missiles. He said a seventh fell short of the target but did not indicate if it did any damage. At the factory, enveloped in a white haze caused by smoldering fires, brown glass jars sat in piles amid bricks and twisted sheet metal. Soldiers and civil defense workers in surgical masks milled around the site. A white box for latex gloves and blue cartons for anti-biotics were piled next to the building. There was little security late Friday and visitors were allowed to enter the deserted factory unhindered. Earlier in the day, a young woman who worked at the factory had asked The AP: ``Are these people crazy? Do you think this is really a weapons factory?'' State-run Sudan television said the factory, which opened in 1996, produced about half of the country's medicines. Its main products were reported to be antibiotics and drugs to treat malaria and tuberculosis. Sudan continued to charge that Clinton took the action to divert public attention from the grand jury investigation into his relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. A statement issued by the Sudanese Embassy in the Kenyan capital Nairobi said that ``the timing was chosen to serve the wish of a sexual pervert and maniac to divert attention away from his crumbling credibility and reputation.'' The podium at the rally el-Bashir addressed was decorated with pictures of Clinton and Lewinsky and bore the slogan ``Clinton: Screw Monica, not Sudan.'' El-Bashir said that ``Clinton and America will have to pay. ... Sudan is for Islam, and we will not be bullied by Americans.'' He pledged to ``pursue all diplomatic channels'' over the missile attack but also said the government was ``opening all training camps'' for volunteers for the national militia. Overnight, Sudanese demonstrators stormed the empty U.S. Embassy compound in Khartoum and pulled down the American flag to protest the attack. The State Department ordered local staff to leave the U.S. Embassy after the bombings of embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es-Salaam two weeks ago. American diplomats were pulled out of Khartoum in 1996. &UR; mo/as-eap/jbm "

				" UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Sudan asked the Security Council to convene an urgent meeting to authorize a fact-finding investigation into the ``barbaric, unjust'' U.S. airstrikes on a Khartoum factory. The Security Council was expected to take up the matter on Monday, council sources said Friday. Washington's justification that Thursday's bombing raids were an act of self-defense were ``very naive, lacking in logic and baseless because Sudan did not carry out any act or threat against the United States,'' said a letter from the state minister at the ministry of external relations. The minister, H.E. Bishop Gobrial Roric, urged the council to ``condemn this barbaric, unjust aggression and make the United States responsible for the human and material damage.'' The letter, sent to council president Danilo Turk of Slovenia, was intended to lodge Sudan's formal complaint that Thursday's U.S. airstrikes on a Khartoum pharmaceutical factory were a breach of the U.N. charter and a violation of its sovereignty. U.S. officials have said they were targeting a terrorist chemical plant linked to a suspect in the U.S. embassy bombings in east Africa. Bahrain, the lone Arab on the council, was expected to raise the issue at the council meeting Monday. The Arab Group of states and another group of Islamic states met Friday at the United Nations to express support for Sudan's effort. The United States hadn't decided what it's response would be, said a U.S. official. U.S. forces carried out the strikes in retaliation for the bombings at U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, which killed over 250 people. U.S. officials have said the cruise missile attack on the Khartoum factory was designed to wipe out a terrorist chemical plant linked to Osama bin Laden, whom U.S. officials accuse in the embassy bombings. In his four-page letter, Roric denied that bin Laden owns the pharmaceutical factory and described accusations that the factory produces chemical weapons as ``untrue,'' adding ``the United States government does not have evidence.'' The United Nations confirmed Friday that it had contracted the el-Shifa plant to supply 100,000 liters of veterinary pharmaceuticals for Iraq under the oil-for-food program. The pharmaceuticals haven't been delivered, U.N. officials said. Roric called for an ``emergency Security Council meeting to discuss this aggression, and send a technical fact-finding mission to investigate the American claims and take the necessary measures to guarantee (the attack) won't be repeated and guarantee the safety and security of my country.'' Sudan's efforts to rally an investigation came as Pakistan criticized Washington for acting unilaterally for what it said was an international problem. ``The problem here is not the right of self-defense. It is how the scourge of terrorism can best be eliminated from the world,'' said Pakistan's U.N. ambassador, Ahmad Kamal. ``And that requires an international consensus and that requires all of us sitting on the same side of the table.'' In a statement, Sudan's mission said ``the aggression is a flagrant violation to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Sudan,'' that violated Article 2 of the U.N. charter, which says member states must refrain from using force against other states. U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson defended the air strikes in a letter Thursday to Turk that said the moves complied with the rights of states to self-defense as enshrined in the U.N. charter and international law. He cited Article 51 of the U.N. charter, which states have the right to self-defense if attacked. Afghanistan's U.N. ambassador, Raban Farhadi, in an interview with the AP called for a formal investigation into the strikes and was consulting with council members to raise the issue before the council. ``We insist on the necessity of diplomatic action because military action may lead to harming civilians,'' said Farhadi, who represents the ousted government of President Burhanuddin Rabbani, ousted by the Taliban in 1996.
