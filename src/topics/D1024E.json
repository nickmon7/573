                "Not quite 24 hours after American cruise missiles hit a factory in a decrepit industrial area of this capital, clouds of white smoke and acrid smells still hovered over the site Friday night.", 
                "About a dozen Sudanese soldiers lounged on the ground at the entrance of the destroyed factory, which the Sudanese say made pharmaceuticals, but which the Americans contend was a cover for the making of chemical weapons.", 
                "Deep puddles of water on the muddy ground attested to the fire-fighting efforts after the strike.", 
                "The Islamic government, accused by the Clinton administration of assisting in the terrorist activities of Osama bin Laden, used these fiery remnants of the factory as a backdrop for a well-organized anti-American demonstration during the day.", 
                "After Friday prayers in the city's mosques, worshipers were urged to attend rallies, including a particularly vocal one at the plant, where leading figures of the government accused the United States of being a ``terrorist'' state.", 
                "At one rally, pictures of President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky were on prominent display, a juxtaposition of a man and his mistress that is interpreted in this very conservative society as the ultimate mockery.", 
                "Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail said that Sudan would remain a ``tomb for its enemies whatever this costs us in human lives.", 
                "'' But the most important Sudanese leader, Hassan al Turabi, who is the speaker of Parliament and the ideological power behind the ruling National Islamic Front, remained silent Friday.", 
                "American intelligence officials have called Turabi a close comrade of bin Laden, whom the administration has accused of being the mastermind of the bombings of two American embassies in East Africa that left hundreds dead.", 
                "Turabi has been a mysterious figure of the fundamentalist government, which grabbed power in the coup in 1989.", 
                "Gen. Omar Hassan al-Bashir, the Sudanese president, made up for Turabi's silence.", 
                "Bashir said that he would prove that the pharmaceutical plant hit by the American missiles was not a cover for making the precursors of nerve gas as Washington claimed.", 
                "``We have undeniable proof'' that the plant was only used for pharmaceutical products such as children's and anti-malarial medicines, he said.", 
                "International companies that had provided equipment for the plant that opened two years ago would back him up, he added.", 
                "The general did not name them.", 
                "In describing the reasons for destroying the plant, Sandy Berger, Clinton's national security adviser, said bin Laden had given key financial help for the plant that was part of the ``Sudanese military industrial complex.", 
                "'' Bin Laden lived in Sudan from 1994 to 1996, a period when Washington says he invited international terrorists to train at camps here.", 
                "He was forced to leave Sudan in 1996 when the government decided that he was too much of an embarrassment and his presence too costly.", 
                "After telling bin Laden to leave, the government hoped to win some concessions from the Clinton administration, including economic aid, but failed to do so.", 
                "As part of its case that the plant was a benign operation, government officials said that it was owned by a Sudanese businessman, Salah Idrisse, who is also a citizen of Saudi Arabia.", 
                "The heart of the factory where most of the smoke was still billowing was off bounds to reporters Friday and it was impossible to tell what was made there.", 
                "In the rubble at the front of the compound were wrappers from a veterinary solution made at the plant and leaflets on how to take Profenil, a trade name for ibuprofen, a widely used pain reliever.", 
                "Trays of small empty brown bottles, apparently used for medicine, were scattered about on the ground.", 
                "Mohammed Hussein, 23, a builder who lives about a mile from the plant, said he saw bright lights and then heard the swoosh of about six missiles during the attack.",

                "Then he thought a plane had crashed.", 
                "Then, he said, it occurred to him that John Garang, the leader of a southern rebel group that has been waging a civil war for more than a decade, had finally struck the capital.", 
                "According to the plant's managing director, Sayed Hamed, the factory employed 360 workers.", 
                "He said the enterprise made 30 varieties of drugs for humans, and 23 kinds of veterinary medicines.", 
                "A hospital spokesman said earlier that 10 people wounded from the strike were admitted to the wards.", 
                "Four of them were critically hurt, he said.", 
                "The plant does not operate at night and there were apparently few workers around during the attack.", 
                "A spokesman for Sudanese opposition political parties based in Cairo, Faruq Ahmed Adam, said he agreed with Washington that the plant was a cover for the manufacture of chemical weapons.", 
                "He said that another factory in the suburb of Kafouri also made chemical weapons.", 
                "He added that Sudanese security forces were investors in the plant.", 
                "Relations between Washington and the Sudanese government have gone from bad to worse in the nine years of the fundamentalist regime.", 
                "But even so, ordinary people seem to be bewildered why American should send cruise missiles here.", 
                "Some said they were skeptical that the pharmaceutical plant was a cover for preparing chemical warfare agents.", 
                "``Most people here, even those who are anti-government, do not believe this particular factory was making chemical weapons,'' one man said.", 
                "But another longtime opposition supporter, a lawyer, said he believed the Americans knew what they were doing.", 
                "``Bin Laden has never built a factory for medicines in his life,'' said the lawyer.",

                "In mosques and in McDonald's, Arabs on Friday criticized U.S. missile strikes in Sudan and Afghanistan as driven more by President Bill Clinton's need to escape scandal than by a battle against terrorism.", 
                "Many said, too, that the attacks would only increase hatred and violence by Muslims against the United States.", 
                "Even among the few Arabs interviewed who defended the U.S. attacks, some questioned whether the targeted Sudanese factory really made chemical weapons ``precursors'' as U.S. officials say _ or medicines as Sudan maintains.", 
                "``The U.S. ... has the right to defend its interests, but it must be certain,'' said Egyptian airline clerk Somaya Farouk, 23.", 
                "``If there was a 1 percent chance that this was a pharmaceuticals plant, then it should have held off.", 
                "'' Clinton said the missiles hit terrorist camps in Afghanistan run by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi millionaire blamed by Washington for the Aug. 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, and a factory linked to bin Laden in Sudan.", 
                "The reaction to the attacks from U.S. opponents in the Middle East was predictable, and American allies mostly remained silent.", 
                "The Cairo-based Arab League condemned the attack in Sudan, calling it ``an unjustified and flagrant aggression on ... an Arab country.", 
                "'' Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi _ still on crutches from a hip operation _ led a protest early Friday in the capital Tripoli, thrusting his fist in the air and shouting, ``Down, down USA.", 
                "'' The strikes were harshly criticized by both Iraq and non-Arab Iran which _ along with Libya and Sudan _ are on the U.S. list of terrorist sponsoring states.", 
                "``We condemn terrorism, but nothing justifies these attacks, especially these random American attacks against Muslim nations,'' Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi told state-run radio.", 
                "In newspapers, and from Arabs on the street, the repeated theme was that Clinton ordered the attacks to draw the spotlight off his affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.", 
                "Reading a newspaper in a McDonald's branch in Bahrain, 25-year-old Saudi citizen Mohammed al-Turki called the American missile strikes ``a plot to divert public attention from Clinton's wrongdoings.", 
                "'' But asked if he sympathized with bin Laden, he said ``he's no better.", 
                "'' Shaaban Ahmed Mohammed, 34, owner of a Cairo newspaper stand, was the only Arab interviewed who saw the strikes by the United States as likely to decrease, not spur, violence.", 
                "``It has the right to protect itself.", 
                "If it remains silent after the last attack (in Kenya and Tanzania), it will be the victim of numerous blows,'' he said.", 
                "More typical was the view of Hussein Rashid, 41, a bookkeeper from the sprawling Cairo neighborhood of Boulaq.", 
                "``When you wash your hands in blood repeatedly, they will never be clean,'' he said.", 
                "``Clinton and the U.S have for years been killing indiscriminately, so this is not new.", 
                "But it certainly won't go unanswered by the Muslim world."

                "In a statement, Sudan's mission said ``the aggression is a flagrant violation to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Sudan,'' that violated Article 2 of the U.N. charter, which says member states must refrain from using force against other states.",

                "``And that requires an international consensus and that requires all of us sitting on the same side of the table.", 
                "Ambassador Bill Richardson defended the air strikes in a letter Thursday to Turk that said the moves complied with the rights of states to self-defense as enshrined in the U.N. charter and international law.",

                "Washington's justification that Thursday's bombing raids were an act of self-defense were ``very naive, lacking in logic and baseless because Sudan did not carry out any act or threat against the United States,'' said a letter from the state minister at the ministry of external relations.", 
                "Bishop Gobrial Roric, urged the council to ``condemn this barbaric, unjust aggression and make the United States responsible for the human and material damage.",
