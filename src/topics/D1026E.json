Saiget ATTENTION - INSERTS details, ADDS quotes /// ss problems with the way transportation is organized, factors contributing to accidents, the need to create better safety devices for vehicles and passengers and to build a better mechanism to respond to accidents, Kurg said.", 
                "By mandating the use of seat belts and helmets for motorcyclists, cracking down on speeding and drunken driving and ensuring good visibility on all roads, China would be able to reduce road fatalities, he said.", 
                "\"These are five important elements that can be effective and that are not expensive to implement,\" Kurg said.", 
                "China's growing love with the autocar has resulted in its car market growing by up to 80 percent in 2003 to the world's fourth largest, but which on the street has meant increasingly treacherous roads jammed with inexperienced and unsafe drivers.", 
                "The report, based on statistics provided by the Chinese government, estimated that some 250,000 people died on Chinese roads in 2002, while more than 16 million a year are injured.", 
                "Official Chinese statistics, however, say that around 104,000 people died in traffic accidents in the country in each of the years 2002 and 2003, an average of about 285 people a day.", 
                "WHO officials said that the number of fatalities officially published by China is based largely on data provided by the Public Security Bureau alone and not on inter-agency data as was tabulated in the WHO report.", 
                "\"These are all estimates, the numbers are possibly underestimated (by China), and maybe overestimated by the WHO,\" Kurg told AFP.", 
                "\"But what we do know is that the problem is very big, that China has the highest rate in the world and the number of deaths is going up very rapidly.", 
                "\" Road traffic fatalities in China are predicted to increase to almost half a million deaths each year by 2020 unless urgent action is taken, the WHO said in a statement.", 
                "\"The side effects of these road accidents is that families are driven into poverty as most of the victims are the breadwinners of their families,\" said Richard Scurfield, head of the World Bank's transportation sector.", 
                "Meanwhile, the economic impact of China's poor road safety is enormous, costing the country between 12 to 21 billion dollars annually, or between one and two percent of China's GNP.", 
                "\"I'm a transportation specialist and I have worked with (China's) Ministry of Communications to jointly try to tackle the road safety issue, but I think that my colleagues agree with me that we weren't very successful,\" Scurfield, who lived and worked in China for many years, said.

                "With proper training, supervision, protective equipment and techniques, and an appropriate emphasis on winning, sports can foster a healthy body and spirit and a lifelong interest in being active and fit.", 
                "Without such measures, childhood sports can lead to disillusionment, injuries and even paralysis or death.", 
                "Even in the best circumstances, no activity can be risk-free.", 
                "But most serious hazards are preventable.", 
                "Cyclists and football players can reduce their risks by wearing helmets; hockey players by wearing masks; basketball and tennis players by wearing eye guards; baseball players by wearing batting helmets.", 
                "In addition, risks to individual players can often be detected, and thus prevented, through a properly performed medical exam before a child plays.", 
                "For accidents that may not be preventable, having an emergency plan and first-aid equipment available, and someone trained to use the equipment, can be lifesaving.", 
                "Still, each year, according to the American College of Sports Medicine, more than 775,000 children under 14 are treated in emergency rooms for sports injuries, nearly half of them preventable.", 
                "An estimated 300,000 athletes experience exercise-related heat illnesses each year, and almost all of them should have been avoided.", 
                "Further, from half to three-fourths of sports-related concussions are never even diagnosed; the injured are often sent back into play too soon and put at risk of another more serious brain-damaging concussion.", 
                "To help reduce these risks, the National Center for Sports Safety, with the National Athletic Trainers' Association, offers a three-hour online safety course for coaches for $28 at www.SportsSafety.org.", 
                "Now, fewer than 10 percent of the 2.5 million volunteer coaches and 33 percent of the interscholastic coaches receive any type of coaching education, the National Youth Sports Safety Foundation reports.", 
                "In March, in a lacrosse game at Cornell University, a shot by a Binghamton player struck Cornell's defenseman George Boiardi above the heart, killing him.", 
                "His death, from a fatal cardiac disturbance called commotio cordis, was the second in four years for a Cornell athlete that resulted from a chaotic heart rhythm.", 
                "The other death, of a freshman wrestler named Graham Morin in November 2000, was a result of a rare, previously undetected heart disorder called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.", 
                "In each case, if an automatic external defibrillator had been available and used within four minutes of the athlete's collapse, there was a good chance that he would have been saved, with his brain intact.", 
                "Likewise for Ryan Boslet who died at 17 in February 2003, during football drills in the high school gym in Alpharetta, Ga. His grandmother, Carol Boslet of Annapolis, Md., is campaigning for improved physicals for teenage athletes before they take part in sports and better education, especially among coaches and trainers.", 
                "Had Boslet's coaches been well informed about this hazard and paid closer attention to him, the outcome would probably have been different.", 
                "Carol Boslet reports that her grandson was constantly short of breath after physical activity, that he was intolerant of the summer heat at football camp and that he felt faint during a football practice.", 
                "Such symptoms warranted a closer look at his cardiovascular system by a knowledgeable doctor.", 
                "(The exam to detect hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, an echocardiogram, costs about $800.", 
                "It is not likely to be used to screen all teenage athletes, who are the ones most at risk, although Italy does such screening routinely.", 
                ") A number of cardiac problems can result in sudden death in a young athlete, including myocarditis (an inflammation of the heart), mitral valve prolapse, long QT syndrome and Marfan syndrome.", 
                "A careful family and personal history, with a well-done physical exam, can help detect these problems early.", 
                "Young athletes should be asked about occurrences of chest pain on exertion, passing out during physical activity and excessive shortness of breath or fatigue in exercise.",

                "OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.", 
                ") Another potentially disastrous injury, paralysis from the neck down, can result from the use of an improper technique in football tackles.", 
                "Called spearing, it involves one player tackling another using the top of his helmet, either intentionally or inadvertently, when a player lowers his head in a tackle.", 
                "The result can be a permanent paralyzing compression injury to the cervical spine.", 
                "Defensive players are most at risk, but others also risk paralysis by lowering their heads at contact.", 
                "Better training is needed -- players should use their shoulders or chests and keep their heads up during tackles -- and penalties for helmet contacts must be enforced.", 
                "Although children today are generally more sedentary than ever before, more youngsters are involved in organized sports and at ever-younger ages.", 
                "Pushing children to play too early or to take part in a sport chosen by the parents can backfire.", 
                "Placing excessive physical and psychological demands on children that they are unable or unwilling to handle can turn them off activities for life.", 
                "Be sure that your child has the desire, strength, coordination and ability to perform the activity and that the coach is able to teach the skills.", 
                "Another hazard is overtraining, often from pressures to win when the goals should be fun, fitness, friendship and sportsmanship.", 
                "When an athlete overtrains, the risk of overuse injuries increases sharply.", 
                "The result can be long-lasting and painful damage to bones and joints.", 
                "Tune in to the signs of overtraining: The child's performance may slack off, motivation to practice may be lacking and the child may tire easily or become irritable or unwilling to cooperate.", 
                "Dr. Lyle Micheli, director of the sports medicine clinic at Children's Hospital Boston, suggests starting with an emphasis on athletic technique, and only when that is mastered should power or speed be addressed.", 
                "He recommends increasing a young athlete's training time by no more than 10 percent a week to reduce the risk of injury.", 
                "Another concern, he said, is nutritional abuse, which afflicts as many as 250,000 young American men who starve themselves every year to make weight in wrestling, along with an untold number of figure skaters, gymnasts and dancers who struggle to remain slim through undernutrition, dehydration and eating disorders.", 
                "All can impair normal growth and development and, in the long run, their basic health.", 
                "At the opposite extreme are young football players who gorge on sweet and fatty foods to bulk up, but put on body fat, not muscle, setting the stage for future problems with obesity.", 
                "Exercise-induced heat illness can be devastating, especially for those who start football practice in late summer.", 
                "Every coach should insist on frequent breaks for water and rest in the shade, plan practices for early or late in the day and avoid use of full uniforms in hot weather.", 
                "Finally, the consistent use of proper-fitting and well-maintained protective athletic equipment is a must for every young athlete.", 
                "Playing surfaces should be well maintained and someone well trained in emergency medical services should be onsite at games and practice sessions. "

                " CHILLS THAT FEVER Even though colds are called colds, most people know that viruses are to blame, not the temperature.", 
                "But a small group of people come down with fevers when they experience chills, according to an article published Saturday in The Lancet, the medical journal.", 
                "One of the study's authors, Dr. Hal Hoffman of the University of California at San Diego, estimates that about 300 people, most in the United States, suffer from the disorder, familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome, or FCAS, which is caused by a single genetic mutation.", 
                "In FCAS, what matters is not the actual temperature but the feeling of being chilled.", 
                "\"It doesn't have to be very cold,\" Hoffman said.", 
                "\"The biggest complaint of FCAS patients is air-conditioned rooms.", 
                "\" To track the disease, Hoffman visited reunions of families carrying the affliction.", 
                "It appears likely that most of the cases stem from a single immigrant in the 1600s, he said, although a few result from more recent mutations.", 
                "Along with their symptoms, the patients also share a common family folklore.", 
                "The story is that the disease started when an ancestor fell into cold water.", 
                "The new study tested an arthritis drug, anakinra, which blocks the effect of a protein that is part of the chain of reactions identified in the cold syndrome.", 
                "First, three women with the disorder were monitored after they sat in a 36-degree room for 45 minutes.", 
                "All three developed fevers and rashes in the hours that followed.", 
                "But none did when given an injection of anakinra before a second chilling.", 
                "Though word of the drug's effectiveness has spread, only a few use it regularly, Hoffman said.", 
                "Some can't afford it -- it's not covered by most insurance -- and others prefer to continue to bundle up.", 
                "REFLUX TRIGGERS A new study from Norway adds smoking and eating salty food to the list of habits that can lead to chronic acid reflux.", 
                "The study found that coffee, alcohol and tea appear to have no effect on the odds of developing the disorder, which is marked by heartburn and frequent regurgitation, while exercise and high-fiber bread appeared to offer some protection.", 
                "Unfortunately for coffee or wine lovers who already suffer from reflux, the study's lead researcher said the findings did not mean a green light for their consumption.", 
                "Coffee and alcohol, along with favorites like chocolate and spicy foods, can still bring on symptoms in reflux patients even if they play no role in its development, said the researcher, Dr. Magnus Nilsson of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm.", 
                "The study, published on Thursday in Gut, a journal of the British Medical Association, was based on two surveys, carried out a decade apart, that included the bulk of the population of a rural county in central Norway.", 
                "A group of 3,153 people who reported reflux were compared with 40,210 people who reported no significant symptoms.", 
                "The researchers found that the odds of developing reflux were 70 percent higher for longtime smokers than for nonsmokers.", 
                "People who ate a lot of salted fish and meat -- traditional foods in the area -- and those who always added salt at meals were significantly more likely to develop reflux than those who never did.", 
                "A half-hour session of strenuous physical activity once a week or more, and regular consumption of high-fiber bread both appeared to cut the risk of reflux in half, the study said.", 
                "Nilsson said that other research conducted by his team showed that people with reflux and people worried about developing it would both also benefit from losing excess weight.", 
                "EPILEPSY AND INJURIES Many people with epilepsy restrict their activities, fearing injury during seizures, even if the disease is well controlled.", 
                "But those fears appear to be overblown, a new Mayo Clinic study concludes.", 
                "The study, published in the journal Neurology, examined the medical records of 247 epilepsy patients who were followed for an average of 10 years.", 
                "It found that only 39 of them suffered seizure-related injuries and that most of them were minor, usually bruises to the head.", 
                "The bulk of the injuries occurred among people with the most serious cases: those with uncontrolled seizures, with generalized convulsions or drop attacks, or those who had suffered injuries in falls in the past, according one of the study's authors, Dr. Elson L. So of the Mayo Clinic.", 
                "Frequency of seizures was the strongest predictor of injury, he said.", 
                "So said that being too cautious carried its own risks, possibly resulting in \"social isolation, physical inactivity and psychological dependency.", 
                "\" He advises people with epilepsy outside the high-risk category to take basic safety measures like wearing helmets while biking.", 
                "They may also consider having companions or supervision for more dangerous activities like swimming.", 
                "Those at higher risk should work with their doctors to bring their seizures under the tightest possible control, he said.", 
                "They should avoid driving and stress and should modify their homes to reduce the chance of accidents or injury, he said.", 
                "An editorial accompanying the article noted that a loosening of restrictions for drivers with epilepsy had not been accompanied by noticeably higher accident rates.", 
                "THE LANGUAGE OF POSTURE The brain reacts more powerfully to the body language of a person in a posture denoting fear than it does to a fearful facial expression, according to a study released Monday.", 
                "The study found that fearful postures activated areas of the brain that happy or neutral postures did not, said the study's lead researcher, Dr. Beatrice de Gelder of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.", 
                "And the reactions to body language involved several areas of the brain not activated by reading faces, including some that process emotions and others that prepare for action.", 
                "\"You could almost say that when you see a fearful body you react with your whole body,\" de Gelder said.", 
                "She said the study, published online in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, offered support to Darwin's theory that emotions are useful in an evolutionary sense because they predispose us to actions that increase the chance of survival.", 
                "For the study, actors were asked to depict scary situations like opening a door and finding a robber, along with happy or emotionally neutral ones like pouring water.", 
                "Still pictures of these, with the actors' faces blurred out, were presented to seven test subjects while their brains were scanned with equipment to detect what regions of the brain were being activated.", 
                "De Gelder said the brain might react more powerfully to emotions signaled through body language than to faces because faces also convey other information, like personal identity, that could slow down mental processing in a moment of danger. "

                "\" Kodesh, 25, said he uses a helmet and kneepads only when he goes to a special skate park, and said he has suffered, \"some broken bones but no major injuries, thank goodness.", 
                "\" Josh Rabinowitz, the publisher of the SkateboardDirectory.com skateboard directory and search engine, said he saw the law chipping away at civil liberties and parents' rights to raise their children the way they want to.", 
                ".", 
                "Rabinowitz, 34, of Manhattan, said the law was just another way for government to raise revenue, \"like all of these ticketing laws that are supposedly for our safety.", 
                "\" For a first violation, a skateboard rider would be warned of the need for a helmet, but on subsequent violations, the rider's parent or guardian could be fined up to $50, said Kevin C. Quinn, a spokesman for the governor, who noted that judges would have discretion. "

                "The headgear gained international visibility during the 2003 Women's World Cup and the Athens Olympics.", 
                "This has triggered alarmed skepticism within the U.S. Soccer Federation, which contends that marketing to the fears of parents has trumped science regarding the effectiveness of headgear in preventing concussions.",
