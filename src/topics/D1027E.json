				"With the first of Shepard's alleged attackers set to go on trial for his life Wednesday, those images of Laramie could work to prosecutors' advantage.",
				"Betty Hoover, a jury consultant based in Raleigh, N.C., said the jurors may be eager to show that the people of Laramie, population 26,000, are progressive, law-abiding folks.",
				"``If you've got a small town where nothing like this has ever happened, then they are definitely going to do their best to portray that they care,'' she said. ``They don't want the world to think that's the type of thing that happens in their town.''",
				"Russell Henderson, 21, is charged with murder, kidnapping and aggravated robbery in Shepard's grisly beating death last October. The crime shocked the nation and drew condemnation from President Clinton and Congress and calls for stronger bias crime laws.",
				"The other man charged in the slaying, Aaron McKinney, 21, is set to go on trial in August. Both could get the death penalty.",
				"Authorities said Henderson and McKinney posed as homosexuals and lured the 5-foot-2, 105-pound Shepard out of a bar, kidnapped him, pistol-whipped him and stole $20. He was left for dead, tied to a fence in the 28-degree chill of Wyoming's high plains. The political science major at the University of Wyoming died five days later at a hospital.",
				"Jon Forwood, a prosecutor in nearby Cheyenne, said the university setting will probably help the defense.",
				"``The academic community is generally perceived as one that is less in favor of the death penalty and more inclined to seek out the emotionalism as to what has happened and why,'' he said.",
				"Joseph Rice, a clinical psychologist and jury consultant in San Francisco, cited what he said is a key difference between this case and the Jasper, Texas, dragging-death trial, in which a white man was swifly convicted and sentenced to die for dragging a black man to pieces.",
				"America, he said, has ``moved further along on the issue of race and people tend to know what the `right' answer is.''",
				"``The homosexual issue is less cut-and-dried, a little more difficult to measure,'' Rice said. ``It's a question less people have considered in their own minds.'' "

				"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The day before one of the men accused of killing her son was going on trial in Wyoming, the mother of gay college student Matthew Shepard lobbied tearfully for hate-crime laws that could deter future acts of violence.",
				"Her plea was seconded by a relative of James Byrd Jr., the black man who was chained to the back of a pickup truck last summer and dragged to his death over East Texas roads.",
				"Judy Shepard and Byrd nephew Daryl Verrett appeared at a Washington news conference organized by the Human Rights Campaign and the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, urging Congress and state legislatures to enact new statutes against hate crimes.",
				"``There is no guarantee that these laws will stop hate crimes from happening. But they can reduce them,'' Mrs. Shepard said haltingly, her statement punctuated by sobs. ``They can help change the climate in this country, where some people feel it is okay to target specific groups of people and get away with it.''",
				"Her son, a University of Wyoming freshman, was pistol-whipped, lashed to a fence and left for dead last October. He died in a hospital five days later. The first of Shepard's two alleged attackers, Russell Henderson, goes on trial Wednesday.",
				"Mrs. Shepard declined to discuss the trial, saying only that she and her husband ``want to allow justice to run its course.''",
				"In Byrd's case, the first of three white men accused in his slaying, white supremacist John William King, was sentenced last month to death by lethal injection.",
				"Byrd's nephew took issue with Texas Gov. George W. Bush and others who question the need for special hate-crime statutes. Bush said Monday: ``People, when they commit a crime, have hate in their heart. I think it's hard to distinguish between one degree of hate or another.''",
				"But Verrett said hate crimes, unlike most other crimes, are meant to have impact beyond the immediate victim.",
				"``Hate crimes are done to send a message of terror to persons of different color, religious beliefs, sexual orientations, ethnicity, nationality or etc.,'' Verrett said. ``The message is if you are in any way like this individual, you are hated, you are subhuman, you have no right to be on this earth, and if possible, all people like you should be exterminated from this earth.''",
				"The savagery of the Shepard and Byrd slayings horrified the nation, giving new impetus to consideration of hate-crimes laws in Washington and state capitals.",
				"Measures pending in Congress would make federal prosecution of hate crimes easier and would expand existing statutes, allowing the Justice Department to prosecute crimes that were based on a person's sex, sexual orientation or disability. Now, the statute only covers crimes based on race, color, religion or national origin.",
				"More than 40 states have hate crimes laws, but only 21 cover sexual orientation.",
				"Some congressional Republicans have suggested the legislation is unnecessary because state laws protect the groups identified in the bill. And some social conservatives bridle at what they view as special protections for homosexuals. "

				"Anti-gay protesters and gay rights advocates have clashed repeatedly over the Shepard case.",

				"Jim Osborn, who attended grade school with Shepard and remained his friend, stopped by the courthouse on his way to work to remember Shepard.",
				"``The most important thing is: My friend is dead,'' Osborn said. ``Matt was a person. He wasn't just a gay man. Nothing can bring him back.''",
				"Asked about having to endure the trials of the two murder suspects, Osborn said, ``It's going to be very difficult.''",
				"Henderson and his co-defendant, Aaron McKinney, 21, both face the death penalty if convicted in a case that has become a central focus for gay rights activists and others seeking stronger bias crime legislation.",

				"``There is no guarantee that these laws will stop hate crimes from happening. But they can reduce them,'' Judy Shepard said at a news conference in Washington, D.C. ``They can help change the climate in this country, where some people feel it is okay to target specific groups of people and get away with it.''",
				"Mrs. Shepard declined to discuss the trial, saying only that she and her husband ``want to allow justice to run its course.''",
				"Authorities said Henderson and McKinney, both high-school dropouts, posed as homosexuals and lured the 5-foot-2, 105-pound Shepard out of a bar last October and then kidnapped and beat him. The political science major at the University of Wyoming died five days later at a hospital.",
				"McKinney is scheduled to stand trial in August.",
				"After the attack, Laramie found itself portrayed as a backwards, homophobic outpost of Wild West-style violence and small-mindedness.",
				"Betty Hoover, a jury consultant based in Raleigh, N.C., said jurors may be eager to show that the people of Laramie, population 26,000, are progressive, law-abiding folks.",
				"``If you've got a small town where nothing like this has ever happened, then they are definitely going to do their best to portray that they care,'' she said. ``They don't want the world to think that's the type of thing that happens in their town.''",
				"City spokesman Randy Vickers said police have set up fences to keep news reporters and demonstrators at bay, and access to the Albany County Courthouse has been limited to one door, where two metal detectors have been installed.",

				"``Are any of you here going to judge this case because you feel guilty and want to make a statement to the nation?'' he asked the prospective jurors. They replied, ``No.''",

				"The crime led to demands for stronger hate-crime laws around the country.",
				"McKinney will be tried later. Both men could get the death penalty.",
				"Skaggs also told the jury candidates that the case ``is not about lifestyles.'' ``This case is not about hate. All crimes ... aren't about hate. They all come down to some real simple motives,'' he said.",
				"One prospective juror, a man in his 40s, objected quickly: ``No, I disagree. ... I think Matthew Shepard's lifestyle was part of this.''",
				"By the end of the day, 15 of the 71 prospective jurors in the first pool had been dismissed, many for financial, medical or child-care related decisions. Jury questioning for the rest of the week will be closed to the public. Opening statements are set for April 6.",
