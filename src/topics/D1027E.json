				"LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- In the weeks after the beating death of gay   student Matthew Shepard, this college town found itself portrayed  as backwards, homophobic, an outpost of Wild West-style violence  and small-mindedness.",
				"With the first of Shepard's alleged attackers set to go on trial   for his life Wednesday, those images of Laramie could work to  prosecutors' advantage.",
				"Betty Hoover, a jury consultant based in Raleigh, N.C., said the   jurors may be eager to show that the people of Laramie, population  26,000, are progressive, law-abiding folks.",
				"``If you've got a small town where nothing like this has ever   happened, then they are definitely going to do their best to  portray that they care,'' she said. ``They don't want the world to  think that's the type of thing that happens in their town.''",
				"Russell Henderson, 21, is charged with murder, kidnapping and   aggravated robbery in Shepard's grisly beating death last October.  The crime shocked the nation and drew condemnation from President  Clinton and Congress and calls for stronger bias crime laws.",
				"The other man charged in the slaying, Aaron McKinney, 21, is set   to go on trial in August. Both could get the death penalty.",
				"Authorities said Henderson and McKinney posed as homosexuals and   lured the 5-foot-2, 105-pound Shepard out of a bar, kidnapped him,  pistol-whipped him and stole $20. He was left for dead, tied to a  fence in the 28-degree chill of Wyoming's high plains. The  political science major at the University of Wyoming died five days  later at a hospital.",
				"Jon Forwood, a prosecutor in nearby Cheyenne, said the   university setting will probably help the defense.",
				"``The academic community is generally perceived as one that is   less in favor of the death penalty and more inclined to seek out  the emotionalism as to what has happened and why,'' he said.",
				"Joseph Rice, a clinical psychologist and jury consultant in San   Francisco, cited what he said is a key difference between this case  and the Jasper, Texas, dragging-death trial, in which a white man  was swifly convicted and sentenced to die for dragging a black man  to pieces.",
				"America, he said, has ``moved further along on the issue of race   and people tend to know what the `right' answer is.''",
				"``The homosexual issue is less cut-and-dried, a little more   difficult to measure,'' Rice said. ``It's a question less people  have considered in their own minds.''"

				"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The day before one of the men accused of   killing her son was going on trial in Wyoming, the mother of gay  college student Matthew Shepard lobbied tearfully for hate-crime  laws that could deter future acts of violence.",
				"Her plea was seconded by a relative of James Byrd Jr., the black   man who was chained to the back of a pickup truck last summer and  dragged to his death over East Texas roads.",
				"Judy Shepard and Byrd nephew Daryl Verrett appeared at a   Washington news conference organized by the Human Rights Campaign  and the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, urging Congress and  state legislatures to enact new statutes against hate crimes.",
				"``There is no guarantee that these laws will stop hate crimes   from happening. But they can reduce them,'' Mrs. Shepard said  haltingly, her statement punctuated by sobs. ``They can help change  the climate in this country, where some people feel it is okay to  target specific groups of people and get away with it.''",
				"Her son, a University of Wyoming freshman, was pistol-whipped,   lashed to a fence and left for dead last October. He died in a  hospital five days later. The first of Shepard's two alleged  attackers, Russell Henderson, goes on trial Wednesday.",
				"Mrs. Shepard declined to discuss the trial, saying only that she   and her husband ``want to allow justice to run its course.''",
				"In Byrd's case, the first of three white men accused in his   slaying, white supremacist John William King, was sentenced last  month to death by lethal injection.",
				"Byrd's nephew took issue with Texas Gov. George W. Bush and   others who question the need for special hate-crime statutes. Bush  said Monday: ``People, when they commit a crime, have hate in their  heart. I think it's hard to distinguish between one degree of hate  or another.''",
				"But Verrett said hate crimes, unlike most other crimes, are   meant to have impact beyond the immediate victim.",
				"``Hate crimes are done to send a message of terror to persons of   different color, religious beliefs, sexual orientations, ethnicity,  nationality or etc.,'' Verrett said. ``The message is if you are in  any way like this individual, you are hated, you are subhuman, you  have no right to be on this earth, and if possible, all people like  you should be exterminated from this earth.''",
				"The savagery of the Shepard and Byrd slayings horrified the   nation, giving new impetus to consideration of hate-crimes laws in  Washington and state capitals.",
				"Measures pending in Congress would make federal prosecution of   hate crimes easier and would expand existing statutes, allowing the  Justice Department to prosecute crimes that were based on a  person's sex, sexual orientation or disability. Now, the statute  only covers crimes based on race, color, religion or national  origin.",
				"More than 40 states have hate crimes laws, but only 21 cover   sexual orientation.",
				"Some congressional Republicans have suggested the legislation is   unnecessary because state laws protect the groups identified in the  bill. And some social conservatives bridle at what they view as  special protections for homosexuals."

				"There were no protesters before the court session got under way,   but authorities set aside areas for them during the trial of  Russell Henderson, 21.",
				"Anti-gay protesters and gay rights advocates have clashed   repeatedly over the Shepard case.",
				"Henderson is accused of pistol-whipping Shepard, lashing him to   a fence in Wyoming's high plains and leaving him to die last fall.",
				"Jury selection was to begin today, with opening statements   scheduled for April 6.",
				"Jim Osborn, who attended grade school with Shepard and remained   his friend, stopped by the courthouse on his way to work to  remember Shepard.",
				"``The most important thing is: My friend is dead,'' Osborn said.   ``Matt was a person. He wasn't just a gay man. Nothing can bring  him back.''",
				"Asked about having to endure the trials of the two murder   suspects, Osborn said, ``It's going to be very difficult.''",
				"Henderson and his co-defendant, Aaron McKinney, 21, both face   the death penalty if convicted in a case that has become a central  focus for gay rights activists and others seeking stronger bias  crime legislation.",
				"On Tuesday, Shepard's mother asked Congress and state   legislatures to enact bias crime laws to deter future acts of  violence.",
				"``There is no guarantee that these laws will stop hate crimes   from happening. But they can reduce them,'' Judy Shepard said at a  news conference in Washington, D.C. ``They can help change the  climate in this country, where some people feel it is okay to  target specific groups of people and get away with it.''",
				"Mrs. Shepard declined to discuss the trial, saying only that she   and her husband ``want to allow justice to run its course.''",
				"Authorities said Henderson and McKinney, both high-school   dropouts, posed as homosexuals and lured the 5-foot-2, 105-pound  Shepard out of a bar last October and then kidnapped and beat him.  The political science major at the University of Wyoming died five  days later at a hospital.",
				"McKinney is scheduled to stand trial in August.",
				"After the attack, Laramie found itself portrayed as a backwards,   homophobic outpost of Wild West-style violence and  small-mindedness.",
				"Betty Hoover, a jury consultant based in Raleigh, N.C., said   jurors may be eager to show that the people of Laramie, population  26,000, are progressive, law-abiding folks.",
				"``If you've got a small town where nothing like this has ever   happened, then they are definitely going to do their best to  portray that they care,'' she said. ``They don't want the world to  think that's the type of thing that happens in their town.''",
				"City spokesman Randy Vickers said police have set up fences to   keep news reporters and demonstrators at bay, and access to the  Albany County Courthouse has been limited to one door, where two  metal detectors have been installed.",
				"The trial is expected to last five weeks."

				"The crime led to demands for stronger hate-crime laws around the   country.",

				"By the end of the day, 15 of the 71 prospective jurors in the   first pool had been dismissed, many for financial, medical or  child-care related decisions. Jury questioning for the rest of the  week will be closed to the public. Opening statements are set for  April 6.",
