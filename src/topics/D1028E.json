The suspect, Theodore Kaczynski, a 55-year-old former University of California math instructor, is charged with four of the 16 attacks attributed to the Unabomber, two of which are fatal.

				"He also said reports of harassment against witnesses -- submitted by attorneys on both sides of the case -- meet the test for juror anonymity spelled out by the 9th U.S. Circuit, which may be asked to overturn his order.",

				"Burrell said the length of the trial, which is expected to last up to six months, makes it impractical to pursue alternatives to an anonymous jury, including sequestering jurors or moving the trial to another city.",
				"The court has contacted about 600 prospects for the 12-member jury, with six alternates, so far. "

				"WASHINGTON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Authorities have moved UNABOMber suspect Theodore Kaczynski from Sacramento County Jail to a federal prison 20 miles southeast of Oakland in California.",
				"Media reports said Kaczynski's lawyers requested the transfer, which was completed Wednesday, 10 weeks before his trial begins in Sacramento.",
				"Officials said the 55-year-old former college mathematics instructor had complained of noise in the jail, although they declined to say if that was the reason for the transfer.",
				"Lt. Dan Lewis, the jail's executive director, said the Federal Correctional Institution near Pleasanton holds a higher number of white collar criminals and may be quieter.",
				"Kacznski is expected to be returned to Sacramento for his trial on November 12. He is charged in four bombings that killed two men and wounded two others.",
				"Explosive devices placed or mailed by the notorious UNABOMber killed three people and injured 23 during a 17-year reign of terror that began in 1978. The terrorist is so dubbed because his first targets included universities and airlines.",
				"Kaczynski was arrested in a cabin in Montana in April last year. "
