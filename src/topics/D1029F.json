				"Tensions in the region escalated Thursday when tribesmen ambushed a convoy of troops and fired rockets at a military base on the outskirts of Dera Bugti, 300 kilometers (185 miles) southeast of Baluchistan province's capital, Quetta.",
				"The ensuing battle lasted 16 hours, ending early Friday after the two sides agreed on a cease-fire, said a Frontier Corps spokesman, Lt. Col. Rizwan Malik. He said eight soldiers were killed and 23 injured but gave no details on any casualties among the attackers or other tribespeople.",
				"Intelligence sources on Thursday told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity that at least 16 tribesmen were killed in the fighting.",
				"Dera Bugti lies about 50 kilometers (30 miles) from Pakistan's main gas field at Sui. Clashes between troops and tribesmen demanding more returns from the natural resources extracted on their territory are common. Baluchistan was rocked by a tribal insurgency in the 1970s and violence has surged again this year.",
				"Hundreds of supporters from ethnic Baluch nationalist parties on Friday staged a protest outside the provincial assembly in Quetta against what they said were high civilian casualties from Thursday's clashes.",
				"Sardar Akhtar Mengal, an opposition politician and former Baluchistan chief minister, claimed the army had \"ruthlessly\" killed over 50 innocent people, including women, children and minority Hindus in Dera Bugti.",
				"He said the government was concealing civilian deaths, and called for a seven-day period of mourning in the province.",
				"No government official was immediately available Friday to answer Mengal's claim. On Thursday, Interior Minister Aftab Khan Sherpao told Parliament in Islamabad, \"There were some casualties, but it is wrong to say that 40 or 70 people were killed.\"",
				"Sherpao said the troops opened fire only when they came under attack.",
				"Pakistan has deployed thousands of soldiers and set up a garrison at the main gas field near Dera Bugti, since rocket attacks blamed on tribesmen killed eight people in early January and disrupted gas supplies across the country.",
				"A parliamentary committee has been set up to examine the tribesmen's claims for greater royalties from the gas reserves and their other grievances. It is expected to make its recommendations to the government soon. "

				"Armed tribesmen have surrounded some 300 paramilitary troops and government officials at a base in a southwestern Pakistani town where fears of fresh fighting between renegade tribesmen and troops have forced thousands of residents to flee for safety, an official said Sunday.",
				"The tribesmen have set up road blocks and dug trenches along roads into Dera Bugti, a town of about 84,000 people which lies 300 kilometers (185 miles) southeast of the Baluchistan provincial capital, Quetta, Baluchistan Gov. Awais Ahmed Ghani said.",
				"Helicopters were airlifting supplies to the troops to avoid traveling by road and confrontation with the tribesmen, Ghani told reporters in Quetta.",
				"More than 3,000 government employees and their families escaped Saturday in vehicles under paramilitary escort from Dera Bugti after a 16-hour battle in the town last week. Ghani said up to 45 people, including eight soldiers, were killed in the fighting.",
				"On Sunday, about 3,000 people, mostly women and children of local Bugti tribesmen, also left the town because they fear fresh fighting, said top administrator Abdul Samad Lasi. He said they were camped in the open outside Dera Bugti or sheltering with relatives in neighboring towns.",
				"\"The situation in Dera Bugti is very tense. You can expect anything (to happen),\" Lasi told The Associated Press by satellite telephone from the town.",
				"Thursday's fighting in Dera Bugti _ about 50 kilometers (30 miles) from Pakistan's main gas fields _ was an alarming escalation of a low-level tribal rebellion in Baluchistan, the country's poorest province. A cease-fire has been holding since early Friday.",
				"Citing intelligence information, Lasi said about 5,000 armed Bugti tribesmen have taken up position on mountains near the town, and that the paramilitary Frontier Corps was ranged against them.",
				"\"If they (the Bugti tribesmen) make any move, if they open fire or attack, the government will give full response,\" he said.",
				"Army spokesman Maj. Gen. Shaukat Sultan said additional army troops have been sent to the gas fields at Sui to strengthen security, but denied the army was involved in an operation against the Bugti tribesmen.",
				"Nawab Akbar Bugti, the chief of Bugti tribe in Dera Bugti, claimed that hundreds of his armed supporters have taken up positions on mountains near the town and they were ready to face the security forces.",
				"\"We have every right to defend ourselves,\" Bugti told AP by satellite telephone from the town.",
				"\"The government wants to kill us. They want to defeat us. They want to loot our resources,\" he said.",
				"Interior Minister Aftab Khan Sherpao told reporters in the capital, Islamabad, that tribal fighters were digging in around Dera Bugti and destroying roads. He described these as \"serious developments,\" but maintained the government wanted to resolve the situation through talks.",
				"Tribesmen are demanding more returns from the natural gas extracted from their territory and resent the army's moves to set up garrisons in the region. Attacks against government targets are common in many parts of the province and have grown in intensity this year.",
				"A parliamentary committee has been set up to examine the grievances of the tribesmen in Baluchistan, which was roiled by insurgency in the 1970s, and make recommendations to the government. "

				"Dera Bugti, some 160 kilometres (99 miles) from the shrine, was the scene of fierce gunbattles on Thursday between troops and tribesmen, who are waging a revolt in a bid to win more royalties from the province's natural resources.",
				"Pakistan Interior Minister Aftab Sherpao has said that eight security personnel and 21 tribesmen including two Hindu minority members were killed in the battles, while 34 people were injured.",
				"Yaqub said investigators had rejected the possibility of sectarian elements behind the attack on the shrine memorial as members of the rival Sunni and Shiite Muslims communities had visited it.",
				"Up to 20,000 people had gathered at the shrine on Saturday evening, most of them from nearby towns and villages. Sufism is a semi-mystical strain of Islam that believes music, dance and song are ways of reaching God.",
				"However Yaqub added that some Muslims resent people dancing and singing at shrines and a number of such people in the area were being quizzed. No arrests had been made, he said.",
				"The death toll from Saturday's bomb blast remained at 39, Yaqub said, dismissing local media reports that more bodies had been discovered at the scene.",
				"Annan condemned the attack \"in the strongest terms\", saying it appeared to have targeted civilians, the UN chief's spokesman Fred Eckhard said.",
				"The secretary general also called for restraint after the \"brazen and cowardly act\".",
				"Police said Sunday they were also investigating whether the bombing had targeted the custodian of the shrine, Sadiq Ali Shah, who had been involved in a dispute with relatives and who last year survived an assassination attempt.",
				"Shah escaped unhurt.",
				"However his brother Syed Kamil Shah poured cold water on the theory, saying the attack was part of a \"terrorism wave\" in the region.",
				"Since the beginning of the year Baluchistan has been hit by frequent, low-level bombings aimed at government and military institutions as well as the railway network.",
				"Thousands of troops moved into Baluchistan after eight people died in a rocket attack on Pakistan's largest gas plant at Sui, which the tribesmen said was sparked by the rape of a female doctor at the installation.",
				"During the 1970s the government brutally put down a major nationalist uprising in Baluchistan, leading to long-lasting distrust and resentment on both sides. "
