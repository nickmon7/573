                "A ceasefire was agreed to remove the dead and wounded from the site of the day-long exchange of machinegun fire in Dera Bugti southeast of the provincial capital Quetta, officials said.",

                "Officials said regular army troops backed by two military helicopters had been sent to tackle the situation.", 
                "An assertion by opposition politician Hafiz Hussain Ahmed that up to 50 tribesmen were killed in the incident was \"exaggerated,\" Sherpao and Cheema said.", 
                "Tribal representatives and the clan's chieftain Akbar Bugti gave similar figures for the number of dead on their side.", 
                "Baluchistan has been in the grip of a sporadic tribal revolt for more han a year but the violence surged after the January 2 rape of a 32-year-old doctor in her lodgings near the Sui gasfield.",

                "Separately, railway officials said a bomb hidden in a toilet tore through a carriage on a passenger train heading towards the provincial capital Quetta, killing one person and injuring five.", 
                "The province has been gripped by a sporadic tribal revolt for more than a year but the violence surged after the January rape of a 32 year-old doctor at Pakistan's largest gas field at Sui in Baluchistan.",

                "It was unclear if the toll included the figure of eight soldiers killed and 23 injured given by officials earlier for the violence at Dera Bugti, southeast of Quetta.", 
                "A ceasefire was agreed late Thursday to remove the dead and wounded.", 
                "\"The casualties were high because the exchange of rockets and mortar shells continued from both sides throughout the day on Thursday,\" the home ministry official said.",

                "Ghulam Rasool, deputy controller of Pakistan railways, told AFP an explosive device was placed in a toilet and detonated at 2:00 pm (0900 GMT) as the train was stopped at Much, a town 70 kilometres (43 miles) southwest of Quetta.", 
                "A shadowy group called the Baluchistan Liberation Army has claimed responsibility for some of the earlier blasts targeting main railway lines in the province.",

                "Dera Bugti, some 160 kilometres (99 miles) from the shrine, was the scene of fierce gunbattles on Thursday between troops and tribesmen, who are waging a revolt in a bid to win more royalties from the province's natural resources.",

                "Up to 20,000 people had gathered at the shrine on Saturday evening, most of them from nearby towns and villages.", 
                "Sufism is a semi-mystical strain of Islam that believes music, dance and song are ways of reaching God.", 
                "However Yaqub added that some Muslims resent people dancing and singing at shrines and a number of such people in the area were being quizzed.",
