				"Norway's daily oil production was down by an estimated 4 percent after a gas leak forced Statoil ASA to shut down one of its platforms in the North Sea.",
				"The gas leak, which led to the evacuation of 180 workers from the floating Snorre A platform located northwest of the port city of Bergen, was contained Monday afternoon, nearly 18 hours after it was reported, Statoil spokesman Oeivind Reinertsen said.",
				"Meanwhile, Marathon Oil Corp. said production on its Brae Alpha platform in the British portion of the North Sea remained closed after a gas leak there on Saturday forced it to shut down, cutting its 36,000 barrels a day of production.",
				"The gas leaks, which were unrelated, resulted in the stopping of 130,000 barrels a day on Statoil's platform, or a 4 percent reduction in Norway's daily production of about 3.2 million barrels a day. The platform processes another 75,000 barrels a day in production from the nearby Vigdis field, but it wasn't clear if that oil was being routed to another platform.",
				"Norway's petroleum ministry said the shutdown would not affect its oil exports since it has sufficient reserves.",
				"Statoil did not say when it expected to resume production at its Snorre A platform, noting that a permanent cap had not been put in place.",
				"\"The safety aspect has top priority at the moment,\" Reinertsen said. \"All other considerations will have to wait.\"",
				"Marathon was similarly mum on when production aboard its platform would restart.",
				"Norway's oil ministry said there was no evidence that any oil leaked from the Statoil-owned floating platform into the water because of the accident.",
				"The 36 workers aboard the platform pumped heavy drilling mud into the leaking injection well.",
				"\"The mud is intended to push back the gas so that we can get at the well to halt the leak,\" Reinertsen said. \"We quickly mobilized technical expertise in Stavanger, and these specialists have been in constant contact with the platform and drilling management on Snorre A.\"",
				"He said the leak was discovered during an attempt to drill a sidetrack from an injection well. Although heavy mud had been pumped in to stem any possible leaks, the gas pushed out as the production tube was being removed.",
				"\"Gas is no longer appearing on the sea surface,\" said Terje Overvik, executive vice president for Statoil's exploration and production Norway, adding that work was still ongoing to permanently secure the well.",
				"Light, sweet crude for January delivery was up 26 cents at US$49.70 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange on Monday. In London, the January contract for Brent crude rose 98 cents to US$45.53 on the International Petroleum Exchange.",
				"Norway is the world's third-largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia and Russia. Statoil was founded by the government in 1972 to oversee the nation's petroleum interests, and employs about 17,000 people in 25 countries. The company was partly privatized in 2001 when the state sold a 17.5 percent stake to investors.",

				"The damage had forced Shell to cut production to 75,000 barrels per day in the field in the Norwegian Sea on Tuesday, but had shut down completely because bad weather prevented repairs, company spokeswoman Kitty Eide said.",
				"The shutdown means that Norway has lost nearly 11 percent of its normal capacity of roughly 3.2 million barrels per day.",
				"Bad weather was in part blamed for Statoil ASA being unable to restart 205,000 barrels per day of production from two other fields, Snorre and Vigdis, which were shut down after a Nov. 28 natural gas leak.",
				"The Norwegian Petroleum Safety Authority, a government agency, has said it needs calmer weather to complete inspections of the Snorre field before it can allow production to resume. It has also said damage to wells may be greater than first believed, and could not give an estimated start date.",
				"At the Draugen field, damage to loading equipment slowed transfers of oil to tankers to the point that the platform's storage tanks were full, and production had to be shut down.",
				"Eide told Dow Jones Newswires that there was a small chance of completing repairs on Friday \"but the weather window isn't looking good.\"",
				"She also said the chances of repairs on Saturday also looked \"very hit-and-run.\"",
				"Once repairs are made, Eide said production could be back to normal within a day.",
				"Norway's Meteorological Office said gales with eight-meter (25-foot) waves were forecast through early next week.",
				"Norway is the world's third largest oil exporter, after Saudi Arabia and Russia. "

platforms",
			"sentences":[
				"Norwegian oil group Statoil on Tuesday requested permission to gradually resume production on two platforms in the North Sea that were shut down last November due to a gas leak, targeting a production of 100,000 barrels per day in the short term.",
				"\"Statoil thinks it will be acceptable to resume partial production from its Snorre A platform in the North Sea,\" the company said in a statement, adding that, \"a partial start-up could take place independently of remaining work with the platform wells\".",
				"Statoil, which will need a green light from the Norwegian Petroleum Safety Authority before resuming production, shut down Snorre A on November 28 last year after a gas leak was detected.",
				"Its satellite platform Vigdis, whose production transits Snorre, was also closed.",
				"The gas leak, which could have caused an explosion if the gas had ignited, was sealed a day later and Statoil has since been trying to secure the injection well where the leak appeared.",
				"Norway, which is the world's third-largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia and Russia and which normally has an average daily production of three million barrels, has seen its oil production reduced by some 205,000 barrels per day (bpd) since the platforms were closed.",
				"Statoil has proposed resuming full production on Vigdis (75,000 bpd), and partial production on Snorre A, by pumping up oil through underwater extensions while repairs continue on the platform itself.",
				"The proposed solution would permit the company in the short term to pump up some 100,000 bpd while waiting for the platform repairs to be completed.",
				"Statoil however said it could take some time to reach even such limited production goals.",
				"\"It will take a lot of time to reach the targeted production levels (of 100,000 bpd) because the installations have been closed for a long time and reopening them requires proceeding with caution,\" company spokeswoman Kjersti Morstoel told AFP.",
				"Continued poor weather conditions in the North Sea also hindered British-Dutch oil giant Shell from resuming production on Tuesday on its Norwegian platform Draugen, which was shut down last Friday after its loading equipment was damaged.",
				"That closure has slashed Norway's oil production by an additional 140,000 bpd. "
