                "The gas leak, which led to the evacuation of 180 workers from the floating Snorre A platform located northwest of the port city of Bergen, was contained Monday afternoon, nearly 18 hours after it was reported, Statoil spokesman Oeivind Reinertsen said.", 
                "Meanwhile, Marathon Oil Corp. said production on its Brae Alpha platform in the British portion of the North Sea remained closed after a gas leak there on Saturday forced it to shut down, cutting its 36,000 barrels a day of production.", 
                "The gas leaks, which were unrelated, resulted in the stopping of 130,000 barrels a day on Statoil's platform, or a 4 percent reduction in Norway's daily production of about 3.2 million barrels a day.", 
                "The platform processes another 75,000 barrels a day in production from the nearby Vigdis field, but it wasn't clear if that oil was being routed to another platform.", 
                "Norway's petroleum ministry said the shutdown would not affect its oil exports since it has sufficient reserves.", 
                "Statoil did not say when it expected to resume production at its Snorre A platform, noting that a permanent cap had not been put in place.", 
                "\"The safety aspect has top priority at the moment,\" Reinertsen said.", 
                "\"All other considerations will have to wait.", 
                "\" Marathon was similarly mum on when production aboard its platform would restart.", 
                "Norway's oil ministry said there was no evidence that any oil leaked from the Statoil-owned floating platform into the water because of the accident.", 
                "The 36 workers aboard the platform pumped heavy drilling mud into the leaking injection well.", 
                "\"The mud is intended to push back the gas so that we can get at the well to halt the leak,\" Reinertsen said.", 
                "\"We quickly mobilized technical expertise in Stavanger, and these specialists have been in constant contact with the platform and drilling management on Snorre A.", 
                "\" He said the leak was discovered during an attempt to drill a sidetrack from an injection well.", 
                "Although heavy mud had been pumped in to stem any possible leaks, the gas pushed out as the production tube was being removed.", 
                "\"Gas is no longer appearing on the sea surface,\" said Terje Overvik, executive vice president for Statoil's exploration and production Norway, adding that work was still ongoing to permanently secure the well.",

                "At the Draugen field, damage to loading equipment slowed transfers of oil to tankers to the point that the platform's storage tanks were full, and production had to be shut down.",

                "Statoil has proposed resuming full production on Vigdis (75,000 bpd), and partial production on Snorre A, by pumping up oil through underwater extensions while repairs continue on the platform itself.",
