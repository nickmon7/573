                "He is a brother-in-law of Samsung Group chief Lee Kun-Hee.",

                "Lee retired from politics after he failed in his second presidential bid in 2002.", 
                "Ruling and opposition party lawmakers have urged Hong to step down, but Roh did not comment on his fate, the spokesman said.", 
                "Former NIS officials told newspapers Monday that the taped conversation was authentic.", 
                "They said the intelligence agency had maintained a special wiretapping unit.", 
                "The People's Solidarity of Participatory Democracy filed a petition Monday with state prosecutors against Lee, Hong and the Samsung chief.", 
                "The influential civic group also called for criminal charges against former government officials suspected of having received bribes from Samsung.", 
                "South Korea was rattled by widespread corruption scandals last year after prosecutors launched a probe into illegal donations by businesses to politicians during the presidential poll in 2002.", 
                "A Samsung executive was accused of donating illicit funds to political parties while dozens of lawmakers, politicians and aides to Roh were arrested.", 
                "Businesses told investigators that they had donated illicit campaign funds for fear of reprisal from politicians if they did not. "

                " South Korea's spy agency publicly apologized Friday for illegally wiretapping telephone calls years ago, revealed by the leakage of a taped 1997 conversation of an alleged payment by the Samsung Group to presidential candidates.", 
                "Prosecutors meanwhile raided the house of a former head of the spy agency, the National Intelligence Service (NIS), late Thursday and seized documents and computer discs believed to be related to the unlawful bugging.", 
                "In an apology broadcast live across the country, NIS director Kim Seung-Gyu said the agency had tapped conversations of influential figures until as late as March 2002 when ex-president Kim Dae-Jung was in office.", 
                "\"Forgive us for the past illegal bugging ... We are now determined to start from scratch and write a new history of NIS,\" he said.", 
                "\"I am convinced that without an honest confession, the NIS cannot get rid of its dark past in order to be born again and fulfil its original mission,\" he said.", 
                "Kim said there had been no illicit wiretapping under the government of President Roh Moo-Hyun.", 
                "\"Now we don't need to conduct illegal bugging, and we don't have the intention of doing so,\" he said.", 
                "A former NIS official who headed a wiretapping team was arrested Thursday for leaking the taped 1997 conversation between Hong Seok-Hyun, a brother-in-law of Samsung Group chief Lee Kun-Hee, and a top official of the group.", 
                "The conversation sparked suspicions that Hong, who later became South Korea's envoy to the United States, acted as a courier for Samsung to dole out slush funds to presidential candidates.", 
                "The arrested former NIS official, 58-year-old Gong Un-Yong, is accused of handing over an audio tape containing the conversation to a Korean-American businessman who was arrested last week.", 
                "The businessman is suspected of leaking the conversation to the media after his attempt to blackmail Samsung for ransom in return for the tape failed.", 
                "Hong has offered to resign as the US ambassadorship since the scandal emerged.", 
                "Prosecutors investigating the illegal wiretapping scandal on Friday raided the home of Chun Yong-Taek who served as the NIS head in 1999.", 
                "Yonhap news agency said prosecutors would summon Lee Hak-Soo, a powerful vice chairman of Samsung, early next week to question him over the wiretapping and allegations that Samsung provided illicit campaign funds to politicians. "

                "Kim, who served from 1998 until 2003, had himself been subject to such monitoring in his days as a leading dissident.", 
                "As it released interim results from its ongoing investigation into the wiretaps Friday, the agency admitted that \"minimal wiretapping\" continued until March 2002, well into Kim's tenure as president, reversing an earlier position that it stopped with the presidential order.", 
                "\"There was a lot of anguish and hesitation internally on whether to confess to the Korean people our past wiretapping activities, but we reached the agreement that we must report the truth,\" the intelligence service chief said.", 
                "Kim Dae-jung's office expressed \"profound regret\" over the spy agency's admission of wiretapping during his government.", 
                "Kim \"never received any report of such illegal activities\" during his presidency, Choi Gyung-hwan, Kim's secretary, said in a statement.", 
                "Roh's office reacted harshly to the admission.", 
                "\"The past abuse of authority revealed today is shocking,\" it said in a statement.", 
                "\"Illegal actions of national agencies should never again occur.", 
                "\" During the investigation, prosecutors discovered 274 wiretapped recordings at the home of one former NIS agent.", 
                "Last month, television network MBC said it had acquired a spy agency recording of a 1997 conversation between Hong Seok-hyun, then publisher of the mass-circulation JoongAng Ilbo, and Lee Hak-soo, a top executive with Samsung Group, the country's biggest industrial conglomerate.", 
                "Hong and Lee obtained a court order preventing the network from broadcasting the tape so it reported the contents based on a transcript of the alleged conversation instead.", 
                "Hong has since announced he will step down from his current position as South Korean Ambassador to the United States.", 
                "Samsung apologized to the nation, expressing regret that \"social confusion was fostered and anxiety caused to the Korean people\" over the report of the tape.", 
                "Prosecutors on Friday began questioning Lee Sang-ho, the MBC reporter who obtained the tape, said Sun Dong-kyu, the network's editor in charge of political coverage.", 
                "It was unclear how he obtained the recording. "
