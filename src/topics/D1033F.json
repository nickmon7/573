ATTENTION - UPDATES with suicide attempt by former spy ///",
			"sentences":[
				"South Korea's envoy to the United States has offered his resignation, bowing to pressure over his alleged involvement in a major political slush fund scandal, officials said Tuesday.",
				"Ambassador Hong Seok-Hyun called the office of President Roh Moo-Hyun late Monday and offered to resign, presidential spokesman Kim Man-Soo said, indicating Hong's resignation would be accepted.",
				"\"It is regrettable as the ambassador has performed his job well at an important time,\" Roh was quoted as saying.",
				"Hong, however, would be allowed to continue his job for the time being until Roh officially accepted his resignation, the spokesman said.",
				"\"The timing of his official resignation will depend on the settlement of his job,\" he said. Hong's resignation requires procedural steps such a letter recalling him from Washington.",
				"Officials at Roh's Uri Party said the government should stop the envoy's resignation from hurting cooperation with the United States about ending a standoff over North Korea's nuclear weapons drive.",
				"Hong came under pressure to resign as suspicions arose that he might have acted as an intermediary between the country's largest conglomerate Samsung and politicians and handed out Samsung's slush funds to presidential candidates in 1997.",
				"The potentially explosive case came to light when a tape of a wiretapped conversation in 1997 between Hong and a top Samsung official was leaked to the press last week.",
				"Hong, the publisher of leading newspaper Joongang Ilbo, was named as ambassador to the United States in February. He is a brother-in-law of Samsung Group chief Lee Kun-Hee.",
				"The recordings reportedly contain discussions about a proposal to give three billion won (2.9 million dollars) to the then-ruling party chief Lee Hoi-Chang. Kim Dae-Jung beat Lee in a presidential election in late 1997. Lee retired from politics after he failed in his second presidential bid in 2002.",
				"A former intelligence official who attempted to commit suicide Tuesday left a note saying the taped conversation was among recordings kept at his home after his retirement and handed over to a Korean-American businessman, Yonhap news agency said.",
				"In his note, Kong Un-Yong alleged that the businessman leaked copies of the taped conversation to the press after his attempt to blackmail Samsung broke down.",
				"Kong, 58, who allegedly headed a special wiretapping unit, was unconscious in hospital after stabbing himself in the stomach, Yonhap said.",
				"The suicide attempt came after Roh asked the National Intelligence Service (NIS), the country's main spy agency, to investigate the case.",
				"Civic groups have urged state prosecutors to investigate Lee, Hong and the Samsung chief.",
				"Samsung apologized Monday over the issue but threatened to file a libel suit, accusing some media outlets of distorting and exaggerating the case.",
				"South Korea was rattled by widespread corruption scandals last year after prosecutors launched a probe into illegal donations by businesses to politicians during the presidential poll in 2002.",
				"A Samsung executive was accused of donating illicit funds to political parties while dozens of lawmakers, politicians and aides to Roh were arrested.",
				"Businesses told investigators that they had donated illicit campaign funds for fear of reprisal from politicians if they did not. "

				"\"I feel sorry because he has been doing a good job as ambassador to the United States at a crucial period,\" Roh was quoted as saying by Kim Man-soo, the presidential spokesman.",

				"Hong and Lee quickly won a court injunction against the broadcast of the recording, but that didn't stop the network from divulging the subject of their alleged conversation: channeling Samsung funds to candidates ahead of the 1997 election.",
				"The Seoul Central District Prosecutors Office on Tuesday began investigating a complaint filed by a civic group against 20 people including Hong and Lee, alleging the illegal distribution of political funds and bribery.",
				"President Roh has called for the National Intelligence Service to conduct a thorough investigation into the alleged illegal wiretapping.",
				"Samsung, preparing legal action against the network, apologized to the nation on Monday, expressing regret that \"social confusion was fostered and anxiety caused to the Korean people\" over the reports of the tape.",

				"\"I ask for the forgiveness of the Korean people for past illegal wiretapping,\" National Intelligence Service chief Kim Seung-kew said, reading a statement to reporters. He also apologized for \"causing anxiety and disappointment to the Korean people\" by leaking the recorded information.",
				"President Roh Moo-hyun ordered an investigation into wiretapping last month after a scandal broke over a recording of an alleged conversation in 1997 between a major newspaper publisher and an influential company executive. The two allegedly discussed channeling slush funds to candidates in that year's presidential election.",
				"The scandal, dubbed the \"X-files\" by local media, struck a raw nerve in a society barely a generation removed from an oppressive military-backed government in which serious curbs on civil liberties and collusive ties between big business and political figures were the norm.",
				"Rampant spy agency wiretapping was believed to have ended after Kim Dae-jung, who won the 1997 election, ordered the practice terminated. Kim, who served from 1998 until 2003, had himself been subject to such monitoring in his days as a leading dissident.",
				"As it released interim results from its ongoing investigation into the wiretaps Friday, the agency admitted that \"minimal wiretapping\" continued until March 2002, well into Kim's tenure as president, reversing an earlier position that it stopped with the presidential order.",
				"\"There was a lot of anguish and hesitation internally on whether to confess to the Korean people our past wiretapping activities, but we reached the agreement that we must report the truth,\" the intelligence service chief said.",
				"Kim Dae-jung's office expressed \"profound regret\" over the spy agency's admission of wiretapping during his government. Kim \"never received any report of such illegal activities\" during his presidency, Choi Gyung-hwan, Kim's secretary, said in a statement.",
				"Roh's office reacted harshly to the admission. \"The past abuse of authority revealed today is shocking,\" it said in a statement. \"Illegal actions of national agencies should never again occur.\"",
				"During the investigation, prosecutors discovered 274 wiretapped recordings at the home of one former NIS agent.",
				"Last month, television network MBC said it had acquired a spy agency recording of a 1997 conversation between Hong Seok-hyun, then publisher of the mass-circulation JoongAng Ilbo, and Lee Hak-soo, a top executive with Samsung Group, the country's biggest industrial conglomerate.",
				"Hong and Lee obtained a court order preventing the network from broadcasting the tape so it reported the contents based on a transcript of the alleged conversation instead.",
				"Hong has since announced he will step down from his current position as South Korean Ambassador to the United States. Samsung apologized to the nation, expressing regret that \"social confusion was fostered and anxiety caused to the Korean people\" over the report of the tape.",
				"Prosecutors on Friday began questioning Lee Sang-ho, the MBC reporter who obtained the tape, said Sun Dong-kyu, the network's editor in charge of political coverage. It was unclear how he obtained the recording. "

				"Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former South Korean President Kim Dae-jung was hospitalized Wednesday, his office said.",
				"Kim, 79, had been feeling weak and had a mild fever for a few days, Kim's secretary Choi Gyung-hwan said in a statement. Concerned about the possibility of an infection, Kim's doctor recommended an examination at Seoul's Severance Hospital, Choi said.",
				"Kim won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2000 for his \"sunshine\" policy of engaging North Korea. He also held an unprecedented summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Il that year.",
				"But his legacy has been tarnished over the scandal that the government made secret payments ahead of the 2000 summit, and also this year over revelations that the intelligence agency engaged in illegal wiretapping during much of his administration. Kim has denied of any knowledge of the wiretapping.",
				"In 2003, Kim underwent an operation to expand his coronary artery as well as hemodialysis, a treatment for kidney disorders. "
