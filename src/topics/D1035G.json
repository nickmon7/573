				"The federal government has paid some benefits to about 6,000   Vietnam veterans who developed cancer and other illnesses.",
				"But an estimated 1,000 veterans were denied back payments under   strict language that required applicants to state that Agent Orange  or herbicides were linked to the cause of the disability or death,  a hurdle ruled illegal Thursday in the class-action lawsuit.",
				"Under VA regulations, veterans do not have to prove they were   exposed to Agent Orange or other herbicides containing the toxic  substance dioxin. In fact, anyone who served in the war is  automatically presumed to have been exposed to it.",
				"A 1989 court ruling in the case voided all VA benefit decisions   it had made based on the agency's assertion that only the skin  disease chloracne was linked to Agent Orange.",
				"Although the VA has since recognized that a variety of cancers   are connected to the defoliant, it has failed to review claims made  prior to the 1989 ruling and continued to insist that benefit  applicants state that their disability resulted from exposure to  Agent Orange, the court found.",
				"``We agree with plaintiffs that the VA's approach is   inconsistent with both the spirit and intent of this court's  decision, as well as the liberal nature of the VA's own claims  process,'' U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson wrote.",
				"``The court expected that the VA would revisit those benefit   decisions that had been erroneously decided under the invalidated  regulations,'' he said.",
				"The plaintiffs wanted the VA ordered to pay the benefits, but   Henderson ruled that the agency should revisit the denied claims.  With benefits denied as far back as 1985, retroactive payments  would average $70,000 per person, plaintiffs' attorney Bart  Stichman said.",
				"No one knows how many people suffer from the effects of Agent   Orange, which was sprayed over wide swaths of jungle by U.S. planes  during a 10-year period to strip away cover from enemy troops and  their convoys.",
				"A call to U.S. Justice Department attorney Karen Richardson   seeking comment Thursday evening was not returned."

				"WASHINGTON (AP) -- A review of what has been done to determine   how Agent Orange and other herbicides affected Vietnam veterans  confirms earlier studies linking them with several diseases but  leaves unanswered painful medical questions of the war that ended  24 years ago.",
				"Thursday's independent report by the Institute of Medicine   appears to offer no new evidence that would affect benefits for  Vietnam War veterans or their offspring, although the Department of  Veterans Affairs said the study will be valuable for further  research.",
				"Despite continuing investigation into possible links to birth   defects, diabetes and a list of other illnesses, no scientific  studies over the last two years has provided enough information to  draw significant new conclusions about whether herbicides are  linked to any condition, study director Dr. David Tollerud said.",
				"Veterans Affairs, which issued a statement praising the   ``thorough and impartial work of the committee,'' offers special  compensation for 10 diseases listed as linked or possibly linked to  herbicide used in Vietnam whether veterans can prove exposure or  not.",
				"Children of veterans also may receive benefits for the birth   defect spina bifida, whose link is listed as ``limited or  suggestive,'' but diabetes is not included. Evidence of a diabetes  link to herbicides or dioxin is listed as still ``inadequate or  insufficient.''",
				"``A lot more research is being done, which we are very   optimistic will continue to provide useful information to answer  the questions that remain,'' said Tollerud, director of the Center  for Environmental and Occupation Health at Philadelphia's Hahnemann  University School of Public Health.",
				"The review keeps four diseases on the list of those for which   evidence establishes links with exposure to herbicides widely used  as defoliants in Vietnam: soft-tissue sarcoma, non-Hodgkin's  lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease and cholaracne. The first three are  forms of cancer.",
				"In the institute's last review of scientific research in 1996,   six other diseases were listed with ``limited or suggestive  evidence of association'' to Agent Orange, other herbicides or the  contaminant dioxin. Added to the list then was spina bifida, the  spinal birth defect found in the children of some Vietnam veterans.",
				"``Based on the recent literature, there are no additional   diseases that satisfy this category's criteria,'' the new report  said. Nor did it find enough evidence to move diseases to a  category of higher or lower certainty.",
				"In an interview, Tollerud said new research was conducted on   diabetes and on spina bifida as well as other diseases.",
				"He said the most serious medical questions still being studied   from the war involve the relationship between herbicides and cases  of diabetes and birth defects among veterans and their offspring.",
				"This year's review is the third in a series of reports. A law   passed in 1991 calls for the National Academy of Sciences to review  new Agent Orange and herbicide studies every two years to determine  if the fresh research finds an added connection between the  chemicals and disease. The Institute of Medicine is an affiliate of  the National Academy of Sciences.",
				"About 19 million gallons of Agent Orange and other chemicals   were used to defoliate trees in the jungles of Vietnam, beginning  in 1962. Their use was stopped in 1971, two years after studies  first linked Agent Orange to birth defects in laboratory animals.",
				"The Department of Veterans Affairs has received more than 92,000   claims and treated more than 50,000 cases of service-related  conditions, spokesman Ken McKinnon said.",
				"He said Vietnam veterans are presumed to have been exposed to   Agent Orange, and veterans with any of the 10 diseases is presumed  to have contracted it from the exposure, without individual proof."

				"BANGKOK, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Thai and U.S. experts would cooperate in an operation to identify the toxic chemicals recently discovered under an airport in Hua Hin, about 200 kilometers south of Bangkok.",
				"The United States has dispatched a team of experts from the Joint United States Military Assistance Group to inspect the site with Thai experts, sources close to the U.S. Embassy here said on Friday.",
				"The strong-smelling hazardous waste was unearthed last week under the Bor Fai airport runway in Hua Hin of Prachuab Khiri Khan Province.",
				"The waste, suspected of being the deadly "Agent Orange" chemical used by the U.S. Army to denude forests to deny Vietnamese fighters ground cover during the Vietnam War, has caused several Thai villagers to fall sick.",
				"However, there is conflicting information over who brought the substance into Thailand. Thailand's Foreign Ministry confirmed that the six Thai military facilities known to have been used by Washington during the Vietnam War excluded Bor Fai airbase, which had long been owned by the Thai Civil Aviation Department.",
				""It had been used as a pilot training ground years before the war and is still used for that purpose," an official said.",
				"The U.S. Embassy has refused to disclose any further details concerning the possibility that Washington had secretly used the airbase during the Vietnam War, saying the information currently available does not go back that far.",
				"Washington sent the inspection team at the request of Bangkok. Jarupong Bunlong, deputy director-general of Thailand's Pollution Control Department, said the chemicals should be identified by next week. All he could confirm for now is that the five 15-liter barrels and one 200-liter barrel that have been found originated from the United States.",
				"Thai experts had earlier discovered the toxic barrels had a code designating their origin, but had not said what the substance was. The code names "Delaware" ( a U.S. state) as the place of origin.",
				"Jarupong said his department has built a shelter around the area to prevent rainfall from dissolving the substance underground."

			"sentences":[
				"HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam _ In what amounted to a chance second-generation reunion from the war years, five teen-age girls laughed and chattered at a lunch table the other day, all of them patients in a hospital for severely deformed or mentally retarded children.",
				"Their fathers had been soldiers from different parts of North Vietnam who fought in the same area of Tay Ninh province in the south and dispersed to their homes when the war ended in 1975. Then they had children. The area where they fought had been heavily sprayed with the herbicide Agent Orange in a wide-ranging, decade-long campaign by the United States to deprive its enemy of forest cover and food crops.",
				"Officials here are convinced that the five teen-agers _ along with tens of thousands of other deformed children of war veterans and exposed civilians _ are the victims of the herbicide and its poisonous residue, dioxin. Reunions like the one in the hospital are not uncommon, the officials say.",
				"But Vietnam's scientific studies have been sketchy and its evidence is often anecdotal. Until there is firm proof that chemical herbicides are to blame, the United States says it cannot take responsibility.",
				"Vietnam has raised the issue only glancingly in talks with the United States, said Ambassador Douglas Peterson. But it arises repeatedly among people here who say it is one of the most painful remnants of a war that ended 24 years ago.",
				"In a country where Americans are generally welcomed with friendship, the absence of aid from the United States for deformed children is one issue that still rankles.",
				"It is a subject that the government-controlled press keeps alive with occasional reports and that is sometimes placed on the agendas of foreign delegations, who are shown shelves full of glass bottles with labels like ``Deformed baby with two heads, one body.''",
				"``You talk so much about human rights and humanity,'' said Dr. Le Cao Dai, who runs the Agent Orange program of the Vietnamese Red Cross. ``No human rights in China. No human rights in Vietnam. So why, these children, are they not eligible for human rights?''",
				"U.S. officials and many independent researchers caution that there is no certainty that Agent Orange is responsible for the illnesses and birth defects, which can have other causes and can be found in other countries in the region.",
				"The Veterans Association in Washington now offers compensation for 10 diseases, as well as for the birth defect spina bifida, that have been determined to be linked, or possibly linked, to the spraying in Vietnam.",
				"The United States says more accurate tests are needed to confirm the Vietnamese assertion that there are victims here as well.",
				"``The Agent Orange issue in this country is driven by propaganda,'' said a diplomat. ``They would have you believe that every deformed baby is a result of Agent Orange. And the same with American GIs.''",
				"From 1962 to 1971, the United States sprayed 12 million gallons of defoliant over more than 10 percent of what was then South Vietnam. Some 14 percent of the area's forests were destroyed, according to U.S. figures, and broad stretches of the landscape are still bare of trees.",
				"The strongest evidence so far that some areas are still contaminated was published last October by a Canadian environmental research group, Hatfield Consultants.",
				"In a five-year study of the Aluoi Valley in central Quang Tri province, the researchers found high levels of dioxin in the soil, in fish and animal tissue, and in the blood of people born after the war.",
				"``If such data were collected in most Western jurisdictions, based on similar sampling levels, major environmental cleanup and more extensive studies would be implemented,'' the report said. ``As Western-based scientists, we can hardly recommend less be done in Vietnam.''",
				"The study was careful not to draw conclusions about the contentious question of human victims of the chemical spraying. But David Levy, vice president and senior scientist of Hatfield, said in an interview that logic would suggest that there were victims.",
				"Over the years, tests conducted by Vietnamese and foreign researchers in certain localities here have documented high levels of contamination of breast milk and blood. Though the methodology may not be as rigorous as that in more-developed nations, the findings are often striking.",
				"Dai said sharp contrasts are evident between the south, which was sprayed, and the north, which was not, and between northern residents who fought in the south and those who did not.",
				"``Of course, to be very accurate, we need to have more medical study to confirm the causes,'' said Dr. Nguyen Thi My Hien, the director of the hospital here, the Thanh Xuan Peace Village, that cares for deformed children. But she said she believed that about 80 of her 100 patients were victims of chemical spraying.",
				"One of these is Nguyen Cong Nang, 11, the severely retarded son of a former soldier who is himself disabled, with metal shrapnel lodged behind his right eye. Now the father, Nguyen Van Hien, 45, spends his days at the hospital, feeding and bathing his son and rocking him to sleep at nap times.",
				"He said that all three of his sons had birth defects and that friends from the war also had children who were born deformed.",
				"``For us it was OK,'' he said of his fellow soldiers. ``We were happy to sacrifice on behalf of the next generation. But these children are innocent of the war. They are a generation of victims who are the children of victims.''",
				"The chance reunion of the children of battlefield comrades included Nguyen Thi Thoa, 15, whose body is covered with black blotches and whose younger brother died of heart disease. Hien described the blotches simply as a melanin disorder and said: ``It is a very serious case. We are confused about how to treat it.''",
				"Sitting by her were two sisters, Nguyen Thi Thuong, 15, and Nguyen Thi Khuyen, 13, both of whom have mild mental retardation and whose growth has been severely stunted.",
				"Hien said the sisters' father had been unable to bear their ailments and had fled their home. After their mother brought them to live at the hospital, the doctor said, the parents reunited and had another baby, who was also born deformed.",
				"That story is not unusual, said Dai of the Red Cross. Parents often consider such births to be punishments for their sins and keep trying for healthy children, only to produce more sick ones.",
				"In some cases, the parents are ostracized by fellow villagers for these presumed sins and exiled to live at the edges of rice fields.",
				"In a final humiliation for these unlucky veterans, he said, ``People sometimes say, `This is happening to you because you killed too many people when you fought in the war.'''"

			"sentences":[
				"Dr. Le Cao Dai, one of Vietnam's top experts on the health effects of Agent Orange, first encountered American military herbicides when he ran a field hospital for the North Vietnamese army along the Ho Chi Minh Trail. American planes would fly low over the forest canopy and release a cloud of chemicals. Within days, the leaves would begin to fall, forcing Dai to move his hospital deeper into the forest for concealment. Only later did he come to believe that the spraying had done long-term health damage to Vietnamese soldiers and civilians.",
				"That belief is shared by leading Vietnamese doctors who were interviewed on a recent trip through Vietnam. None would hazard a guess to this writer as to how extensive the damage had been, but one was later quoted in the Vietnamese press as asserting that some 70,000 Vietnamese are now suffering from illnesses caused by Agent Orange.",
				"The evidence to support these beliefs is weak, for it is a sad irony of the Vietnam War that those most likely to have been affected by the spraying _ the Vietnamese themselves _ have been the least effectively studied. The United States has put enormous effort into assessing possible harm to American soldiers but found only limited damage, perhaps because most soldiers had relatively little contact with the chemicals during their short tours of duty. Meanwhile, the Vietnamese troops directly under the spray and civilians who lived in the sprayed areas for years or moved in later, have been studied primarily by Vietnamese scientists whose results are not generally accepted by scientists from more advanced nations.",
				"American herbicides, of which the most prominent was Agent Orange, were widely dispersed to defoliate trees over supply routes, clear away brush from roadsides, riverbanks and base camps, and kill food crops that sustained guerrilla bands. More than 10 percent of the land area of South Vietnam was sprayed at least once, and some areas were sprayed repeatedly. The herbicides themselves would generally dissipate within weeks but would leave behind a toxic contaminant, dioxin, that was inadvertently created during the manufacturing process.",
				"Journalists who inquire about Agent Orange are routinely taken to ``peace villages'' to see malformed children, to an exhibit on health consequences at the medical school in Hanoi or to a collection of malformed fetuses at an obstetrical hospital in Ho Chi Minh City. All three sites make a powerful case that there is appalling illness in Vietnam, but all fall short of demonstrating that Agent Orange was the culprit. The birth defects, cancers and other illnesses that the Vietnamese attribute to Agent Orange can be caused by a wide range of factors, and Agent Orange may not be prominent among them.",
				"The epidemiological and laboratory studies that offer the best hope of teasing out answers are difficult for even the most advanced scientific countries to perform. Vietnamese studies that purport to find excess cancers, birth defects and other illnesses in soldiers and civilians from areas that were sprayed are discounted by Western experts for lack of stringent methodology.",
				"Vietnamese and American scientists once started a collaborative research effort, but it fell apart three years ago when Vietnamese authorities confiscated research samples before they could leave the country. Now, however, the Vietnamese and the American Embassy in Hanoi are both suggesting a joint study of the effects of the herbicides. The U.S. National Academy of Sciences has been asked to consider whether it is feasible to do a study so long after the spraying, in a nation where health records and disease measures are notoriously incomplete.",
				"The research seems well worth doing, if it is technically feasible. An authoritative study would add to the growing literature on the health effects of herbicides and dioxin, could help the Vietnamese decide how to allocate scarce health resources and might shed additional light on the effects of Agent Orange in American veterans. Most compelling of all, it might finally close one of the festering wounds from the Vietnam War."
