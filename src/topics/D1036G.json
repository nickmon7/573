                "Multiple blood tests were abnormal, doctors here say; his skin was covered with odd-looking lesions; and his digestive tract was dotted with ulcers from top to bottom.", 
                "Europe's most illustrious doctors were stumped; the patient's many symptoms defied a unifying diagnosis.", 
                "Eight days later, Viktor A. Yushchenko, Ukraine's opposition leader, checked out against medical advice, determined to return to the business of winning the presidential election in Ukraine.", 
                "In less than two weeks he was back, crippled by excruciating back pain that required such huge doses of morphine to control that he almost ended up on a ventilator.", 
                "Once again, a week of testing found no medical explanation.", 
                "Yushchenko and his doctors agreed on a risky plan: Doctors threaded a small tube through the skin of his upper back, into his spinal canal, so he could receive constant pain-killing medication while campaigning.", 
                "So it was that Yushchenko flew back to Kiev with a catheter lodged in his back, escorted by a team of Austria's most elite doctors.", 
                "He campaigned with the tube in place for a week, attending several large rallies, according to his press secretary, Irina Gerashchenko.", 
                "Dr. Michael Zimpfer, the medical director at the hospital here, personally supervised Yushchenko.", 
                "\"I went with him because I had serious security concerns and I wanted to make sure he was handled properly,\" he said.", 
                "Indeed, the doctors had become increasingly suspicious that foul play, possibly an unusual poisoning, could be the cause of their patient's problems, a charge that Gerashchenko repeated.", 
                "In interviews this week, the Austrian doctors were quick to emphasize that, scientifically, they could not say that the candidate had been poisoned.", 
                "They tested only for common agents, and found none.", 
                "But the medical team became so concerned about the possibility of an unconventional agent that they consulted biological and chemical weapons experts.", 
                "\"A poisoning without the poison is like a murder without a gun,\" Zimpfer said.", 
                "\"But if someone said to me, 'Look what we found!",

                "New details of Yushchenko's hospital admissions in Vienna raise disturbing questions: Was the candidate poisoned or infected with some biological agent, and, if so, with what?", 
                "What is his current state of health, in the middle of a pivotal battle for power?", 
                "In September, Yushchenko immediately said he had been poisoned, but that charge was lost among the heated political debates and demonstrations in the final weeks of the campaign, which culminated in the disputed election.", 
                "\"Look at my face,\" Yushchenko told the Ukrainian parliament on Sept. 21, after his first stint in the Vienna hospital.",

                "The issue has persisted because of the obvious disfigurement and discoloration of his face, which is swollen and pocked with large bumps and cysts, and is a dusky grayish color.", 
                "The left eye is bloodshot and sometimes waters.", 
                "Last week a British toxicologist, Dr. John Henry, suggested that Yushchenko's symptoms were consistent with dioxin poisoning, which causes a severe form of acne called chloracne.", 
                "The condition occurs months to years after exposure, when the body seeks to eliminate residue of the chemical through the skin.", 
                "But cases of dioxin poisoning are extremely rare.", 
                "Scientists debate whether a huge one-timedose could be delivered as a poison.", 
                "Doctors at Rudolfinerhaus said they did not test Yushchenko for dioxin in part because his skin changes were much milder in September, not suggestive of dioxin.", 
                "The candidate refused a biopsy of his face -- which doctors suggested to try to narrow down the causes -- because he did not want to campaign with stitches.", 
                "But dioxin and related toxic chemicals are detectable in the body years after exposure.",

                "Some doctors not involved with the Yushchenko case, consulted for their opinions, said that he could be suffering from an unusual immune disease.", 
                "Scleromyxedema, for instance, is an extremely rare progressive disorder that produces facial symptoms much like Yushchenko's.",

                "He arrived first on Sept. 10, severely ill and unable to walk, after five days of terrible abdominal pain.", 
                "Initial testing showed that he had a high white cell count, as well as elevated liver and pancreas enzymes, suggesting inflammation of those organs.", 
                "His tests were negative for all the obvious possibilities, like hepatitis caused by a virus.", 
                "Scans showed that his liver, pancreas and intestine were, indeed, swollen.", 
                "Internal examinations of the intestine using an endoscope found that he had ulcerations -- essentially bleeding abrasions -- of the stomach and throughout his intestine and bowel as well.",

                "The doctors gave him supportive care, like intravenous fluid and a restricted food intake to rest the digestive tract.", 
                "As he gradually recovered strength, he opted to get back to the campaign trail.", 
                "Already, doctors noticed that he was developing odd lesions on his face and trunk.", 
                "Ten days later, the candidate returned, after three days of what he called excruciating back pain.", 
                "Its source was again a mystery, since related lab tests and scans were normal.", 
                "The pain was so severe that doctors had to place a large-bore intravenous line into Yushchenko's chest and essentially nearly anesthetize him with huge doses of opiates.", 
                "Because opiates depress respiratory functions, his breathing rate slowed, and his vital signs had to be constantly monitored.", 
                "More medicine would have required that Yushchenko be placed on a respirator, Zimpfer said.", 
                "Yushchenko and his doctors made a difficult choice: They decided to place an epidural catheter between his shoulder blades into the membranes of the upper spine so that medicines could be delivered to the nerves in his back without compromising his mental abilities.", 
                "Epidural catheters are common for pain relief in childbirth, but they are far riskier when they are placed for longer periods and in the upper back, closer to the brain and vital nerves.", 
                "Yushchenko was discharged three days later, leaving with a retinue of doctors and cartons of medical supplies.", 
                "He was still on \"plenty\" of medication, said Zimpfer.", 
                "They arrived in Ukraine, and, after a few hours, Zimpfer returned to Vienna, leaving Yushchenko in the care of another Austrian doctor.", 
                "\"He was severely ill, but this does not all add up to a single disease or even a known syndrome,\" Zimpfer said.", 
                "\"At this point his diagnosis is just a description of all his symptoms.",

                " Ukrainian presidential hopeful Viktor Yushchenko was poisoned with dioxin, most likely intentionally, doctors in Vienna who have been struggling to diagnose his mystery illness confirmed Saturday.", 
                "Yushchenko, a pro-Western opposition leader engaged in a bitter presidential contest, has alleged since suddenly falling ill in September that he was poisoned in an assassination attempt intended to eliminate a key critic of Ukraine's government.", 
                "Authorities have denied the charge, and some government supporters have ridiculed it.", 
                "Michael Zimpfer, director of the private Rudolfinerhaus clinic that has been treating Yushchenko, said tests concluded in the last 24 hours prove that dioxin caused the illness that has disfigured the Ukrainian candidate's face.", 
                "``There is no doubt about the fact that Mr. Yushchenko's disease has been caused by dioxin poisoning,'' he told reporters at a news conference at the clinic.", 
                "The doctors, Zimpfer said, ``suspect the involvement of an external party,'' and that the dioxin was given orally.", 
                "``The criminal investigation does not fall within our purview,'' he added.", 
                "The diagnosis was based on clinical observations, skin changes and findings from tissue and blood samples, he said.", 
                "Asked whether he had reported his findings to the Ukrainian authorities, Zimpfer replied that Austrian justice officials have been in direct contact with Ukraine since Yushchenko's second hospitalization in late September.", 
                "Yushchenko fell sick Sept. 6, the day after having late-night food and drinks with the head of the Security Service of Ukraine, among other people.", 
                "Yushchenko's wife, Kateryna Chumachenko, said she noticed a strange taste on his lips when she kissed him that night.", 
                "``I tasted some medicine on his breath, on his lips,'' she said in an interview on ABC's ``Good Morning America.", 
                "'' ``And I asked him about it.", 
                "He brushed it away, saying there is nothing.", 
                "'' Yushchenko has suffered problems that affected several internal organs and caused severe back pain, according to his doctors.", 
                "The most visible symptom has been disfigurement of his face with pockmarks, cysts and darkened areas.", 
                "In recent weeks, medical experts in various countries have said the facial condition appeared to be chloracne, which is associated with dioxin poisoning.", 
                "The explosive allegation of attempted murder, now backed by fresh medical evidence, could have an unpredictable effect on a repeat presidential runoff election pitting Yushchenko against Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych on Dec. 26.", 
                "The revote was set after the Supreme Court ruled the Nov. 21 balloting, narrowly won by Yanukovych, invalid because of fraud.",

                " The illness that disfigured the face of opposition presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko resulted from poisoning by the toxic substance dioxin, which might have been placed deliberately in his food, Austrian doctors who treated him told reporters in Vienna on Saturday.", 
                "``The criminal investigation does not fit within our purview but ... there is suspicion of third-party involvement,'' said Michael Zimpfer, director of Vienna's private Rudolfinerhaus clinic, where the candidate went for treatment in September after falling ill while campaigning.", 
                "The face of the once youthful-looking Yushchenko, 50, was mysteriously transformed into a blotch of lesions after he reached Austria.", 
                "He also suffered severe abdominal and back pain and paralysis on the left side of his face.", 
                "His appearance has continued to worsen, raising public concern about his health despite his claims he is fully recovering.", 
                "Yushchenko contends he was poisoned in an assassination attempt by ``government officials'' who feared that he would defeat Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych in runoff elections held on Nov. 21.", 
                "His opponents have dismissed the charge, saying he got sick after gorging himself on bad sushi and too much alcohol.", 
                "Yanukovych was officially declared the winner of the Nov. 21 vote.", 
                "The country's Supreme Court soon overturned that finding, citing widespread poll fraud, and a new election will be held on Dec. 26.", 
                "The Austrian doctors, addressing reporters in Vienna on Saturday, said Yushchenko's long-term prognosis was good, though it could take several years for his face to heal.", 
                "For now, Yushchenko is ``fully capable of working,'' said Nikolai Korpan, another doctor.", 
                "``If this dose had been higher, it may have caused death,'' Zimpfer said, noting the dioxin could have been administered through food, such as soup.", 
                "Dioxins are a group of organic compounds that contain chlorine.", 
                "They are a common byproduct in the manufacture of many industrial chemicals, and are also a common contaminant from waste incineration.", 
                "They are a component of the Vietnam-era defoliant Agent Orange and many researchers have labeled them a cause of cancer and other diseases among people who were exposed to the defoliant.", 
                "Debate over dioxins' potency as a poison, as opposed to a cancer-causing agent, has swirled for decades.", 
                "But the compounds are known to cause reproductive and developmental problems, in addition to extreme skin eruptions known as chloracne.", 
                "Documented cases of acute dioxin poisoning are rare.", 
                "One notable case occurred in Seveso, Italy, in 1976, when an explosion at a Hoffman-LaRoche chemical plant released a cloud of the herbicide 2,4,5-T, exposing several thousand people to the chemical and an estimated 45 pounds of dioxins, which typically arise as a byproduct in the synthesis of 2,4,5-T.", 
                "Many people near the plant developed severe skin problems within hours.", 
                "In the months that followed, many who experienced heavy exposures developed chloracne.", 
                "Another case occurred in 1997 in Vienna, where two employees of a textile institute developed chloracne on their bodies, according to Olaf Paepke, a scientist at a Hamburg institute, who conducted chemical analysis for the investigation.", 
                "The employees had levels of dioxin in their systems thousands of times higher than normally found.", 
                "Police were never able to determine how the poisoning occurred, including if it was deliberate or accidental, Paepke said.", 
                "The employees survived.", 
                "Dioxins are not commercially available, Paepke said, but can be obtained through industry contacts or made in a laboratory by people with the proper skills.", 
                "A tiny, unnoticeable amount placed in food is sufficient to cause severe illness, he said.", 
                "Arnold Schecter, a dioxin expert at the University of Texas School of Public Health at Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, said dioxins can be highly effective poison in people who are sensitive to their effects.", 
                "If Yushchenko was deliberately given dioxin, it was done by ``someone was very clever and very knowledgeable,'' Schecter said.", 
                "``If someone put a drop of pure dioxin in his food, he wouldn't taste it, he wouldn't see it and a few days later he'd start to get sick,'' Schecter said.", 
                "``If you are trying to kill someone quickly, it's not the way to go,'' he said.", 
                "``But if you want to disable someone and want to do it subtly and have it happen days or weeks or months after you have contact with someone, this can do it,'' Schecter said.", 
                "``Plus there are very few labs in the world that can accurately detect dioxin in the blood.", 
                "'' Paul M. Wax, with the American College of Toxicology, said two scientists he met in Volgograd, Russia, in 1992, told him that during the Soviet era they had investigated the potential of developing dioxin as a chemical weapon.", 
                "Wax expressed doubts that dioxin could be used in that way.", 
                "``It was never on anyone's list,'' said Wax, who now teaches courses on chemical terrorism.", 
                "``We don't think about it as an acute poison that can kill you.", 
                "...", 
                "It's not going to cause someone to keel over on a battlefield,'' but could cause long-term illness.", 
                "A Russian government specialist challenged the Vienna doctors' findings.", 
                "``It is impossible to get a dose of dioxin today and get poisoning tomorrow,'' said Yury Ostapenko, head of the Toxicology Information Center at the Russian Health Ministry, speaking on the Echo Moskvy radio station.", 
                "``Dioxins do not belong to immediate-effect poisons: poisoning develops for years and decades.", 
                "'' Doctors at the Austrian clinic had declined for weeks to issue a finding on the cause of the illness, but said Saturday that tests conducted in an Amsterdam hospital had confirmed the presence of dioxin.", 
                "Yushchenko flew to Austria on Friday for further tests at the clinic.", 
                "``What happened to me was an attempt to politically destroy a politician with opposing views,'' he said at a news conference in Kiev on Friday, shortly before his departure.", 
                "``The aim was to kill me.", 
                "'' Speaking to 5,000 supporters in the city of Luhansk before the announcement in Vienna, Yanukovych said of Yushchenko: ``He certainly is ill and I sympathize.", 
                "Let him get well soon.", 
                "As for the reasons, I know nothing.", 
                "Let the specialists work on that.", 
                "'' Yushchenko supporters said the finding bore out what they had long believed.", 
                "``This official confirmation is another opportunity to speak the truth to the Ukrainian people and to show one more time the dirty methods that were used by the authorities,'' said Yuri Yekhanurov, a member of parliament, in a telephone interview.", 
                "In Vienna, Yushchenko struck an upbeat note Saturday.", 
                "``I plan to live for a long time and I plan to live happily,'' he said.", 
                "``I am getting better ... every day.",

                " New tests conducted Friday night at a hospital in Vienna, Austria, confirmed that Viktor A. Yushchenko, the Ukrainian opposition candidate for president, had been poisoned with dioxin, providing an explanation for a broad array of painful and disfiguring conditions that plagued him during the past three months of the campaign.", 
                "There was \"no doubt\" that Yushchenko's disease \"has been caused by a case of poisoning by dioxin,\" Dr. Michael Zimpfer, president of the Rudolfinerhaus Hospital said at a news conference on Saturday.", 
                "\"We have proved the source of his problem, and we clearly suspect third party involvement,\" Zimpfer said in a subsequent interview.", 
                "But he said law-enforcement authorities would have to determine how the poisoning occurred.", 
                "Yushchenko and his aides had long insisted that he had been poisoned, a charge that his opponents ridiculed, saying that the once-telegenic candidate had been stricken by bad sushi or too much drink.", 
                "On Friday, Yushchenko said: \"It is my growing conviction that what happened to me was an act of political reprisal against a politician in opposition.", 
                "The aim, naturally, was to kill me.", 
                "\" Zimpfer, who has been part of Yushchenko's medical team since he was first rushed to Rudolfinerhaus in early September, said that Yushchenko's blood dioxin level was \"more than 1,000 times\" the upper limits of normal and that his initial severe abdominal pain suggested that he had eaten the poison.",

                "Dioxin, a waste product of various industrial chemical processes, is a highly toxic chemical that remains in the body for years after exposure, so doctors were able to test their patient Friday, long after the near-fatal poisoning occurred.", 
                "Initially the poison often produces severe abdominal pains, nausea and vomiting -- and, in the long term, very high doses can produce the kind of skin cysts and discoloration that have disfigured Yushchenko.", 
                "Such cysts can persist for years after the initial dose, as do several other more subtle medical effects.", 
                "Dioxin causes a strong predisposition toward developing cancer later in life and can also affect the body's fat metabolism.", 
                "But none of that would affect Yushchenko's political aspirations today.", 
                "\"If you survive the initial attempt, you can do all right,\" Zimpfer said.", 
                "\"He is perfect condition, in perfect mental shape.", 
                "\" An extremely unusual cause of poisoning, dioxin exposure most often comes from industrial accidents where it is inhaled or absorbed through the skin.", 
                "Doctors in Vienna declined to speculate on exactly how Yushchenko was poisoned.", 
                "\"We weren't there and we will have to leave that to the legal authorities to decide,\" he said. "

                " The Ukrainian prosecutor-general's office announced Sunday it had reopened an investigation into allegations that presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko was poisoned, after doctors in Austria confirmed he had ingested dioxin.", 
                "Returning to Kiev after checking out of a clinic in Vienna, Austria, Yushchenko said he was sure that authorities were responsible for the dioxin poisoning that had disfigured his face and caused other symptoms.", 
                "``I am convinced that this is the work of the authorities, absolutely convinced,'' Yushchenko told reporters at Kiev airport.", 
                "The pro-Western reformer is engaged in a bitter presidential contest with Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych and has alleged since suddenly falling ill in September that he was poisoned in an assassination attempt.", 
                "Authorities have denied the charge, and some pro-government politicians have ridiculed it.", 
                "Yushchenko fell sick Sept. 6, a day after having late-night food and drinks with Ihor Smeshko, the head of the Security Service of Ukraine, and others.", 
                "The prosecutor-general's office dropped its initial investigation of the allegation in late October.", 
                "Serhiy Rudenko, a spokesman, said then that no poisoning agents had been found in forensic medical tests and that there was no data to prove deliberate poisoning or the use of biological weapons against Yushchenko.", 
                "Speaking to reporters Sunday at the private Rudolfinerhaus clinic in Vienna, where doctors announced Saturday that they had confirmed dioxin poisoning, Yushchenko said a full-scale investigation should wait until after Dec. 26, when he faces Yanukovych in a repeat election.", 
                "The Supreme Court set the revote after ruling that the Nov. 21 balloting, narrowly won by Yanukovych according to the official count, was invalid due to fraud.", 
                "``I don't want this factor to influence the election in some way -- either as a plus or a minus,'' Yushchenko said.", 
                "``This question will require a great deal of time and serious investigation.", 
                "Let us do it after the election.", 
                "Today is not the moment.", 
                "'' Yushchenko said massive street protests in central Kiev's Independence Square, which helped prompt parliament to enact electoral reforms aimed at preventing fraud in the revote, had brought historic change to Ukraine.", 
                "``I think that the heart of Ukraine moved to Independence Square in Kiev over the last three weeks, and old people, young people, everyone, were defending not Yushchenko but they were defending their choice for the type of Ukraine they want to see in the future,'' he said, as his U.S.-born wife, Kateryna Chumachenko, translated.", 
                "``We hadn't seen anything like that for the past 100 years,'' Yuschenko said.", 
                "``I think it would be appropriate to compare this to the fall of the Soviet Union or the fall of the Berlin Wall.", 
                "... Over the last three weeks, you have seen a different country, a different nation.", 
                "The regime that was in place for 14 years in Ukraine is now living its last days.", 
                "'' Michael Zimpfer, the clinic's director, thanked doctors from around the world who had helped ``to clarify the difficult Yushchenko illness that has not been observed anywhere else beforehand.", 
                "'' While dioxin poisoning is not medically unknown, it typically occurs through environmental exposure, when it is inhaled or absorbed through the skin.", 
                "Doctors said Saturday that damage to Yushchenko's digestive system suggested the poison had been ingested.", 
                "``It would have been easy to put it in a cream soup,'' Zimpfer said Saturday.", 
                "At Kiev airport, Yushchenko said it should not take too long to reach a conclusion in the attempted murder case.", 
                "``A lot of the circumstances are already known,'' he said.", 
                "``I think if the general prosecutor acts according to Ukraine's laws, both the country and the world at large will soon know who did this.",

                " The poisoning of Ukraine's opposition icon Viktor Yushchenko overshadowed the country's presidential election campaign Monday after the Western-leaning candidate accused the government of trying to kill him, and his pro-Russia rival denied any knowledge of the case.", 
                "\"This is the work of the government,\" Yushchenko said upon his return to Kiev late Sunday from an Austrian clinic where doctors confirmed for the first time that he had somehow swallowed massive amounts of the toxin that can cause cancer and death.", 
                "\"If the prosecutor general keeps to the law and acts accordingly, then soon Ukraine and the whole world will find out who did this,\" said Yushchenko, who underwent a new round of tests at the clinic over the weekend.", 
                "Doctors at the Rudolfinerhaus clinic determined that the pro-West opposition leader was poisoned by ingesting a dioxin dose that exceeded 1,000 times the safe limit -- possibly by eating spiked soup -- causing his face to be disfigured weeks before the first round of a presidential vote.", 
                "Yushchenko has previously charged that the hardline regime of outgoing President Leonid Kuchma poisoned him to take him out of the contest against Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovich, whom the opposition leader comfortably led in the polls when he was struck.", 
                "On Sunday Yushchenko refused to name any specific officials and said the inquiry should determine the culprit.", 
                "\"This is a very delicate question and one should not be accusing anyone at this point -- this should be determined by the investigation,\" he said.", 
                "Yanukovich said Monday he could not have known anything about the alleged government plot because as prime minister he did not oversee the security structures that could have possibly orchestrated the attack.", 
                "\"In my job as prime minister, I did not have anything to do with the work of law enforcement agencies.", 
                "That was not my competence,\" Yanukovich told reporters when asked to comment on Yushchenko's charges.", 
                "\"I am insisting that law enforcement agencies get to the bottom of this,\" he said when asked to respond to Yushchenko's charges.", 
                "\"I sympathize as a person with Mr Yushchenko that he is sick.", 
                "I hope that he gets better soon.", 
                "\" The Interfax news agency reported Monday that the prosecutor general's office has re-opened a criminal investigation into the case after closing an earlier inquiry.", 
                "Yushchenko will face Yanukovich on December 26 in a rerun vote after the supreme court stripped the prime minister of his victory in the November 21 runoff because of massive ballot fraud.", 
                "Before the doctors' confirmation, presidential administration authorities have said that Yushchenko may have fallen ill from eating spoiled food or perhaps drinking too much bad liquor.", 
                "In Washington, the White House urged Ukraine to fully investigate the \"terrible\" poisonin Meanwhile Yanukovich pressed on with his message that he would no longer represent the ruling regime in the December 26 vote after what he has called Kuchma's \"betrayal\" of him during the talks with Yushchenko to resolve the standoff over the November 21 poll.", 
                "\"I was deeply disappointed in this man,\" he told reporters.", 
                "\"This crisis showed his true character and he began defending the interests of himself and his family.", 
                "\" \"The battle against me is being waged by the old government and people who once served in government... those who robbed Ukraine and drove her people to poverty,\" he said. "
