				"When the once-robust, telegenic man was wheeled in through the sliding glass doors of the plush Rudolfinerhaus hospital in early September, he was severely ill, conscious but groggy and complaining of terrible abdominal pain. Multiple blood tests were abnormal, doctors here say; his skin was covered with odd-looking lesions; and his digestive tract was dotted with ulcers from top to bottom.",
				"Europe's most illustrious doctors were stumped; the patient's many symptoms defied a unifying diagnosis. Eight days later, Viktor A. Yushchenko, Ukraine's opposition leader, checked out against medical advice, determined to return to the business of winning the presidential election in Ukraine.",
				"In less than two weeks he was back, crippled by excruciating back pain that required such huge doses of morphine to control that he almost ended up on a ventilator. Once again, a week of testing found no medical explanation.",
				"Yushchenko and his doctors agreed on a risky plan: Doctors threaded a small tube through the skin of his upper back, into his spinal canal, so he could receive constant pain-killing medication while campaigning.",
				"So it was that Yushchenko flew back to Kiev with a catheter lodged in his back, escorted by a team of Austria's most elite doctors. He campaigned with the tube in place for a week, attending several large rallies, according to his press secretary, Irina Gerashchenko.",
				"Dr. Michael Zimpfer, the medical director at the hospital here, personally supervised Yushchenko. "I went with him because I had serious security concerns and I wanted to make sure he was handled properly," he said. Indeed, the doctors had become increasingly suspicious that foul play, possibly an unusual poisoning, could be the cause of their patient's problems, a charge that Gerashchenko repeated.",
				"In interviews this week, the Austrian doctors were quick to emphasize that, scientifically, they could not say that the candidate had been poisoned. They tested only for common agents, and found none. But the medical team became so concerned about the possibility of an unconventional agent that they consulted biological and chemical weapons experts.",
				""A poisoning without the poison is like a murder without a gun," Zimpfer said. "But if someone said to me, 'Look what we found!' I wouldn't be at all surprised.",
				""In this case, absence of evidence is not evidence of absence," he said.",
				"He continued: "As I've said to the family, If this is a poisoning, it's going to be very tricky and tough to discover. They are not going to use some regular household agent."",
				"Gerashchenko said that Yushchenko was continuing to receive treatment from Ukrainian doctors. "He feels much better than he did two months ago, but he's far from ideal," she said.",
				"New details of Yushchenko's hospital admissions in Vienna raise disturbing questions: Was the candidate poisoned or infected with some biological agent, and, if so, with what? What is his current state of health, in the middle of a pivotal battle for power?",
				"In September, Yushchenko immediately said he had been poisoned, but that charge was lost among the heated political debates and demonstrations in the final weeks of the campaign, which culminated in the disputed election.",
				""Look at my face," Yushchenko told the Ukrainian parliament on Sept. 21, after his first stint in the Vienna hospital. "Note my articulation. This is one-hundredth of the problems that I've had. This is not a problem of political cuisine as such. We are talking about the Ukrainian political kitchen where assassinations are ordered."",
				"Opponents dismissively suggested that the cause of Yushchenko's hospitalization was bad sushi or too much alcohol; doctors here said there was no evidence of either. But some doctors point out that it is conceivable Yushchenko had the bad luck to develop a rare illness, difficult to diagnose, at the height of the campaign.",
				"The issue has persisted because of the obvious disfigurement and discoloration of his face, which is swollen and pocked with large bumps and cysts, and is a dusky grayish color. The left eye is bloodshot and sometimes waters.",
				"Last week a British toxicologist, Dr. John Henry, suggested that Yushchenko's symptoms were consistent with dioxin poisoning, which causes a severe form of acne called chloracne. The condition occurs months to years after exposure, when the body seeks to eliminate residue of the chemical through the skin. But cases of dioxin poisoning are extremely rare. Scientists debate whether a huge one-timedose could be delivered as a poison.",
				"Doctors at Rudolfinerhaus said they did not test Yushchenko for dioxin in part because his skin changes were much milder in September, not suggestive of dioxin. The candidate refused a biopsy of his face -- which doctors suggested to try to narrow down the causes -- because he did not want to campaign with stitches. But dioxin and related toxic chemicals are detectable in the body years after exposure. Gerashchenko said tests for such substances had still not been performed.",
				"Some doctors not involved with the Yushchenko case, consulted for their opinions, said that he could be suffering from an unusual immune disease. Scleromyxedema, for instance, is an extremely rare progressive disorder that produces facial symptoms much like Yushchenko's. But it is not known to produce pain.",
				"Dermatologists at Rudolfinerhaus initially suggested that the facial lesions could represent a slightly unusual case of a well-known condition called rosacea, where the face becomes swollen and lumpy. But Zimpfer said Yushchenko's skin nodules no longer indicated that disease.",
				"(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)",
				"Political intrigue is not the norm at Rudolfinerhaus, an elite private hospital that caters to wealthy Austrians and foreigners.",
				"Zimpfer provided extensive details of Yushchenko's hospitalizations. He arrived first on Sept. 10, severely ill and unable to walk, after five days of terrible abdominal pain. Initial testing showed that he had a high white cell count, as well as elevated liver and pancreas enzymes, suggesting inflammation of those organs. His tests were negative for all the obvious possibilities, like hepatitis caused by a virus.",
				"Scans showed that his liver, pancreas and intestine were, indeed, swollen. Internal examinations of the intestine using an endoscope found that he had ulcerations -- essentially bleeding abrasions -- of the stomach and throughout his intestine and bowel as well. Ulcers are typically not spread out in that way.",
				"The doctors gave him supportive care, like intravenous fluid and a restricted food intake to rest the digestive tract. As he gradually recovered strength, he opted to get back to the campaign trail. Already, doctors noticed that he was developing odd lesions on his face and trunk.",
				"Ten days later, the candidate returned, after three days of what he called excruciating back pain. Its source was again a mystery, since related lab tests and scans were normal.",
				"The pain was so severe that doctors had to place a large-bore intravenous line into Yushchenko's chest and essentially nearly anesthetize him with huge doses of opiates. Because opiates depress respiratory functions, his breathing rate slowed, and his vital signs had to be constantly monitored. More medicine would have required that Yushchenko be placed on a respirator, Zimpfer said.",
				"Yushchenko and his doctors made a difficult choice: They decided to place an epidural catheter between his shoulder blades into the membranes of the upper spine so that medicines could be delivered to the nerves in his back without compromising his mental abilities.",
				"Epidural catheters are common for pain relief in childbirth, but they are far riskier when they are placed for longer periods and in the upper back, closer to the brain and vital nerves.",
				"Yushchenko was discharged three days later, leaving with a retinue of doctors and cartons of medical supplies. He was still on "plenty" of medication, said Zimpfer. They arrived in Ukraine, and, after a few hours, Zimpfer returned to Vienna, leaving Yushchenko in the care of another Austrian doctor.",
				""He was severely ill, but this does not all add up to a single disease or even a known syndrome," Zimpfer said. "At this point his diagnosis is just a description of all his symptoms.""

			"sentences":[
				"Ukrainian presidential hopeful Viktor Yushchenko was poisoned with dioxin, most likely intentionally, doctors in Vienna who have been struggling to diagnose his mystery illness confirmed Saturday.",
				"Yushchenko, a pro-Western opposition leader engaged in a bitter presidential contest, has alleged since suddenly falling ill in September that he was poisoned in an assassination attempt intended to eliminate a key critic of Ukraine's government. Authorities have denied the charge, and some government supporters have ridiculed it.",
				"Michael Zimpfer, director of the private Rudolfinerhaus clinic that has been treating Yushchenko, said tests concluded in the last 24 hours prove that dioxin caused the illness that has disfigured the Ukrainian candidate's face.",
				"``There is no doubt about the fact that Mr. Yushchenko's disease has been caused by dioxin poisoning,'' he told reporters at a news conference at the clinic. The doctors, Zimpfer said, ``suspect the involvement of an external party,'' and that the dioxin was given orally. ``The criminal investigation does not fall within our purview,'' he added.",
				"The diagnosis was based on clinical observations, skin changes and findings from tissue and blood samples, he said.",
				"Asked whether he had reported his findings to the Ukrainian authorities, Zimpfer replied that Austrian justice officials have been in direct contact with Ukraine since Yushchenko's second hospitalization in late September.",
				"Yushchenko fell sick Sept. 6, the day after having late-night food and drinks with the head of the Security Service of Ukraine, among other people. Yushchenko's wife, Kateryna Chumachenko, said she noticed a strange taste on his lips when she kissed him that night. ``I tasted some medicine on his breath, on his lips,'' she said in an interview on ABC's ``Good Morning America.'' ``And I asked him about it. He brushed it away, saying there is nothing.''",
				"Yushchenko has suffered problems that affected several internal organs and caused severe back pain, according to his doctors. The most visible symptom has been disfigurement of his face with pockmarks, cysts and darkened areas. In recent weeks, medical experts in various countries have said the facial condition appeared to be chloracne, which is associated with dioxin poisoning.",
				"The explosive allegation of attempted murder, now backed by fresh medical evidence, could have an unpredictable effect on a repeat presidential runoff election pitting Yushchenko against Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych on Dec. 26. The revote was set after the Supreme Court ruled the Nov. 21 balloting, narrowly won by Yanukovych, invalid because of fraud.",
				"Yushchenko supporters, however, already believed he had been poisoned, and it was not immediately clear how many Yanukovych backers would be willing to believe the Vienna doctors.",
				"Some people in the opposition camp remained nervous whether the Dec. 26 balloting really would take place. Saturday's announcement potentially raised the stakes by increasing the possibility that if the poisoning were an assassination attempt, those responsible might be caught and punished under a Yushchenko presidency.",
				"``I don't want all of us to have the impression that the Yanukovych campaign and Yanukovych himself have relaxed and stopped fighting,'' Yulia Tymoshenko, a key opposition leader, said at a Saturday news conference in Kiev, the capital. ``They will try everything for the presidential elections not to happen, or not to have a result.''",
				"Under Ukrainian law, if a presidential election is so flawed that it is impossible to determine the result, it is possible for the incumbent to remain in power while new balloting is organized.",
				"Speaking to a rally in the eastern city of Luhansk before the Vienna announcement, Yanukovych expressed sympathy for Yushchenko. ``He really is a sick person,'' Yanukovych replied. ``I had a little talk with him concerning this topic. I'm sorry for him as a person. I wish him to get well soon. As for the reasons, I know nothing. Let the specialists work on that.''",
				"Yanukovych's campaign manager, Taras Chornovyl, has rejected any possibility that the prime minister was involved in the alleged poisoning. There is ``no logic in such an accusation,'' he said.",
				"Yushchenko first checked into the Vienna clinic Sept. 10, at which point, according to Zimpfer, he had been ill for five days. The effects of dioxin poisoning are swift as the substance rapidly is absorbed by the body, Zimpfer said. Yushchenko's dioxin levels in blood and tissue samples taken in September but only recently tested specifically for that substance were at least 1,000 times higher than normal, a level Zimpfer said required a dose of just milligrams.",
				"``It would have been easy to put it in a cream soup, for example,'' he said.",
				"Zimpfer said that Yushchenko's dioxin levels have returned to normal and that he probably would leave the clinic Sunday or Monday.",
				"Zimpfer said the doctors did not know for sure whether Yushchenko had been poisoned by just one substance or by a combination of substances. ``It is possible that we only found the dioxin,'' he said. Damage to the digestive system suggested that the poison had been ingested orally, he said.",
				"(Begin optional trim)",
				"In an Oct. 7 statement to Ukraine's parliament, Volodymyr Sivkovych, chairman of an ad hoc commission that looked into Yushchenko's illness, reported on the opposition leader's activities the day before he became ill. On the evening of Sept. 5, Yushchenko first had dinner at the summer house of a businessman, where sushi was served that had not been refrigerated for more than three hours, Sivkovych said. From late that evening until 2:00 a.m. the next day, ``Yushchenko was visiting the summer house of Volodymyr Satsyuk, the first deputy chairman of the Security Service of Ukraine,'' he said. The security service head, Ihor Smeshko, was also present, he said. The commission understood this meeting was held at the request of a Yushchenko associate, he said.",
				"``Food was served on common plates, and drinks were served . . . from bottles that were uncorked in the presence of the company,'' Sivkovych reported. ``Yushchenko started to complain of splitting headaches early on Sept. 6.''",
				"Yushchenko outlined his allegations of an attempted assassination in a Sept. 21 speech to Parliament.",
				"``Friends, this is not a problem of cuisine as such,'' Yushchenko said then. ``We are talking about a Ukrainian political kitchen, where assassinations are ordered!'' Yushchenko cited the suspicious but unexplained deaths of several prominent figures, including Vyacheslav Chornovil, a former presidential candidate who died in a traffic accident several years ago.",
				"``In 1999 Vyacheslav Chornovil was here alive,'' he said. ``We pretend we don't know who killed him with a Kamaz truck. In 2000, (campaigning journalist) Georgi Gongadze was sitting on the balcony over there and writing political reports. Who cut his head off? Well, we don't seem to know, although one prosecutor said once that the killer has already been found, and that his surname begins with the letter K. He wasn't brave enough to give us a few more letters.''",
				"Gongadze's death has been the darkest shadow trailing Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma.",
				"Tapes purportedly recorded secretly by a former Kuchma bodyguard disclose that the president made repeated complaints about Gongadze to his former interior minister, Yuri Kravchenko. Gongadze disappeared the night of Sept. 16, 2000, shortly after going out to empty the trash. An autopsy showed that he died within hours. His head has not been found.",
				"A former police officer, Ihor Honcharov, said last year that he had information that police working with a criminal gang had abducted the journalist on orders from Kravchenko, who was following orders from Kuchma.",
				"Honcharov had been arrested on charges of being a member of a rogue police gang that had been involved in contract killing. He died in prison last August. The prosecutor general's office said he died of spinal trauma as a result of being beaten.",
				"Yushchenko has said that if he is elected president, prosecutors will pursue investigations into the death of Gongadze and other high-profile criminal cases.",
				"(End optional trim)",
				"Nikolai Korpan, the doctor who oversaw Yushchenko's treatment, said no ``functional damage'' would remain as a result of the dioxin exposure. But the doctors said that Yushchenko's facial disfigurement would remain for a long time as follow-up treatments continue.",
				"Holley reported from Kiev, Ukraine, and Yee reported from Vienna."

			"sentences":[
				"The illness that disfigured the face of opposition presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko resulted from poisoning by the toxic substance dioxin, which might have been placed deliberately in his food, Austrian doctors who treated him told reporters in Vienna on Saturday.",
				"``The criminal investigation does not fit within our purview but ... there is suspicion of third-party involvement,'' said Michael Zimpfer, director of Vienna's private Rudolfinerhaus clinic, where the candidate went for treatment in September after falling ill while campaigning.",
				"The face of the once youthful-looking Yushchenko, 50, was mysteriously transformed into a blotch of lesions after he reached Austria. He also suffered severe abdominal and back pain and paralysis on the left side of his face. His appearance has continued to worsen, raising public concern about his health despite his claims he is fully recovering.",
				"Yushchenko contends he was poisoned in an assassination attempt by ``government officials'' who feared that he would defeat Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych in runoff elections held on Nov. 21. His opponents have dismissed the charge, saying he got sick after gorging himself on bad sushi and too much alcohol.",
				"Yanukovych was officially declared the winner of the Nov. 21 vote. The country's Supreme Court soon overturned that finding, citing widespread poll fraud, and a new election will be held on Dec. 26.",
				"The Austrian doctors, addressing reporters in Vienna on Saturday, said Yushchenko's long-term prognosis was good, though it could take several years for his face to heal. For now, Yushchenko is ``fully capable of working,'' said Nikolai Korpan, another doctor.",
				"``If this dose had been higher, it may have caused death,'' Zimpfer said, noting the dioxin could have been administered through food, such as soup.",
				"Dioxins are a group of organic compounds that contain chlorine. They are a common byproduct in the manufacture of many industrial chemicals, and are also a common contaminant from waste incineration. They are a component of the Vietnam-era defoliant Agent Orange and many researchers have labeled them a cause of cancer and other diseases among people who were exposed to the defoliant.",
				"Debate over dioxins' potency as a poison, as opposed to a cancer-causing agent, has swirled for decades. But the compounds are known to cause reproductive and developmental problems, in addition to extreme skin eruptions known as chloracne.",
				"Documented cases of acute dioxin poisoning are rare.",
				"One notable case occurred in Seveso, Italy, in 1976, when an explosion at a Hoffman-LaRoche chemical plant released a cloud of the herbicide 2,4,5-T, exposing several thousand people to the chemical and an estimated 45 pounds of dioxins, which typically arise as a byproduct in the synthesis of 2,4,5-T.",
				"Many people near the plant developed severe skin problems within hours. In the months that followed, many who experienced heavy exposures developed chloracne. Another case occurred in 1997 in Vienna, where two employees of a textile institute developed chloracne on their bodies, according to Olaf Paepke, a scientist at a Hamburg institute, who conducted chemical analysis for the investigation. The employees had levels of dioxin in their systems thousands of times higher than normally found. Police were never able to determine how the poisoning occurred, including if it was deliberate or accidental, Paepke said. The employees survived.",
				"Dioxins are not commercially available, Paepke said, but can be obtained through industry contacts or made in a laboratory by people with the proper skills. A tiny, unnoticeable amount placed in food is sufficient to cause severe illness, he said.",
				"Arnold Schecter, a dioxin expert at the University of Texas School of Public Health at Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, said dioxins can be highly effective poison in people who are sensitive to their effects. If Yushchenko was deliberately given dioxin, it was done by ``someone was very clever and very knowledgeable,'' Schecter said.",
				"``If someone put a drop of pure dioxin in his food, he wouldn't taste it, he wouldn't see it and a few days later he'd start to get sick,'' Schecter said.",
				"``If you are trying to kill someone quickly, it's not the way to go,'' he said. ``But if you want to disable someone and want to do it subtly and have it happen days or weeks or months after you have contact with someone, this can do it,'' Schecter said. ``Plus there are very few labs in the world that can accurately detect dioxin in the blood.''",
				"Paul M. Wax, with the American College of Toxicology, said two scientists he met in Volgograd, Russia, in 1992, told him that during the Soviet era they had investigated the potential of developing dioxin as a chemical weapon.",
				"Wax expressed doubts that dioxin could be used in that way. ``It was never on anyone's list,'' said Wax, who now teaches courses on chemical terrorism. ``We don't think about it as an acute poison that can kill you. ... It's not going to cause someone to keel over on a battlefield,'' but could cause long-term illness.",
				"A Russian government specialist challenged the Vienna doctors' findings. ``It is impossible to get a dose of dioxin today and get poisoning tomorrow,'' said Yury Ostapenko, head of the Toxicology Information Center at the Russian Health Ministry, speaking on the Echo Moskvy radio station. ``Dioxins do not belong to immediate-effect poisons: poisoning develops for years and decades.''",
				"Doctors at the Austrian clinic had declined for weeks to issue a finding on the cause of the illness, but said Saturday that tests conducted in an Amsterdam hospital had confirmed the presence of dioxin.",
				"Yushchenko flew to Austria on Friday for further tests at the clinic. ``What happened to me was an attempt to politically destroy a politician with opposing views,'' he said at a news conference in Kiev on Friday, shortly before his departure. ``The aim was to kill me.''",
				"Speaking to 5,000 supporters in the city of Luhansk before the announcement in Vienna, Yanukovych said of Yushchenko: ``He certainly is ill and I sympathize. Let him get well soon. As for the reasons, I know nothing. Let the specialists work on that.''",
				"Yushchenko supporters said the finding bore out what they had long believed.",
				"``This official confirmation is another opportunity to speak the truth to the Ukrainian people and to show one more time the dirty methods that were used by the authorities,'' said Yuri Yekhanurov, a member of parliament, in a telephone interview.",
				"In Vienna, Yushchenko struck an upbeat note Saturday. ``I plan to live for a long time and I plan to live happily,'' he said. ``I am getting better ... every day.''",
				"Staff Writers Rob Stein, Rick Weiss, Juliet Eilperin, Joby Warrick and John Burgess in Washington contributed to this report."

				"New tests conducted Friday night at a hospital in Vienna, Austria, confirmed that Viktor A. Yushchenko, the Ukrainian opposition candidate for president, had been poisoned with dioxin, providing an explanation for a broad array of painful and disfiguring conditions that plagued him during the past three months of the campaign.",
				"There was "no doubt" that Yushchenko's disease "has been caused by a case of poisoning by dioxin," Dr. Michael Zimpfer, president of the Rudolfinerhaus Hospital said at a news conference on Saturday.",
				""We have proved the source of his problem, and we clearly suspect third party involvement," Zimpfer said in a subsequent interview. But he said law-enforcement authorities would have to determine how the poisoning occurred.",
				"Yushchenko and his aides had long insisted that he had been poisoned, a charge that his opponents ridiculed, saying that the once-telegenic candidate had been stricken by bad sushi or too much drink.",
				"On Friday, Yushchenko said: "It is my growing conviction that what happened to me was an act of political reprisal against a politician in opposition. The aim, naturally, was to kill me."",
				"Zimpfer, who has been part of Yushchenko's medical team since he was first rushed to Rudolfinerhaus in early September, said that Yushchenko's blood dioxin level was "more than 1,000 times" the upper limits of normal and that his initial severe abdominal pain suggested that he had eaten the poison.",
				"Yushchenko has always been vague on the topic of who tried to poison him.",
				"A spokeswoman for Yushchenko, Irina Gerashchenko, said in a telephone interview that the diagnosis compelled prosecutors to reopen a criminal investigation into his poisoning.",
				"Dioxin, a waste product of various industrial chemical processes, is a highly toxic chemical that remains in the body for years after exposure, so doctors were able to test their patient Friday, long after the near-fatal poisoning occurred. Initially the poison often produces severe abdominal pains, nausea and vomiting -- and, in the long term, very high doses can produce the kind of skin cysts and discoloration that have disfigured Yushchenko.",
				"Such cysts can persist for years after the initial dose, as do several other more subtle medical effects. Dioxin causes a strong predisposition toward developing cancer later in life and can also affect the body's fat metabolism. But none of that would affect Yushchenko's political aspirations today. "If you survive the initial attempt, you can do all right," Zimpfer said. "He is perfect condition, in perfect mental shape."",
				"An extremely unusual cause of poisoning, dioxin exposure most often comes from industrial accidents where it is inhaled or absorbed through the skin.",
				"Doctors in Vienna declined to speculate on exactly how Yushchenko was poisoned.",
				""We weren't there and we will have to leave that to the legal authorities to decide," he said."

				"The Ukrainian prosecutor-general's office announced Sunday it had reopened an investigation into allegations that presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko was poisoned, after doctors in Austria confirmed he had ingested dioxin.",
				"Returning to Kiev after checking out of a clinic in Vienna, Austria, Yushchenko said he was sure that authorities were responsible for the dioxin poisoning that had disfigured his face and caused other symptoms.",
				"``I am convinced that this is the work of the authorities, absolutely convinced,'' Yushchenko told reporters at Kiev airport.",
				"The pro-Western reformer is engaged in a bitter presidential contest with Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych and has alleged since suddenly falling ill in September that he was poisoned in an assassination attempt. Authorities have denied the charge, and some pro-government politicians have ridiculed it.",
				"Yushchenko fell sick Sept. 6, a day after having late-night food and drinks with Ihor Smeshko, the head of the Security Service of Ukraine, and others.",
				"The prosecutor-general's office dropped its initial investigation of the allegation in late October. Serhiy Rudenko, a spokesman, said then that no poisoning agents had been found in forensic medical tests and that there was no data to prove deliberate poisoning or the use of biological weapons against Yushchenko.",
				"Speaking to reporters Sunday at the private Rudolfinerhaus clinic in Vienna, where doctors announced Saturday that they had confirmed dioxin poisoning, Yushchenko said a full-scale investigation should wait until after Dec. 26, when he faces Yanukovych in a repeat election.",
				"The Supreme Court set the revote after ruling that the Nov. 21 balloting, narrowly won by Yanukovych according to the official count, was invalid due to fraud.",
				"``I don't want this factor to influence the election in some way -- either as a plus or a minus,'' Yushchenko said. ``This question will require a great deal of time and serious investigation. Let us do it after the election. Today is not the moment.''",
				"Yushchenko said massive street protests in central Kiev's Independence Square, which helped prompt parliament to enact electoral reforms aimed at preventing fraud in the revote, had brought historic change to Ukraine.",
				"``I think that the heart of Ukraine moved to Independence Square in Kiev over the last three weeks, and old people, young people, everyone, were defending not Yushchenko but they were defending their choice for the type of Ukraine they want to see in the future,'' he said, as his U.S.-born wife, Kateryna Chumachenko, translated.",
				"``We hadn't seen anything like that for the past 100 years,'' Yuschenko said. ``I think it would be appropriate to compare this to the fall of the Soviet Union or the fall of the Berlin Wall. ... Over the last three weeks, you have seen a different country, a different nation. The regime that was in place for 14 years in Ukraine is now living its last days.''",
				"Michael Zimpfer, the clinic's director, thanked doctors from around the world who had helped ``to clarify the difficult Yushchenko illness that has not been observed anywhere else beforehand.''",
				"While dioxin poisoning is not medically unknown, it typically occurs through environmental exposure, when it is inhaled or absorbed through the skin. Doctors said Saturday that damage to Yushchenko's digestive system suggested the poison had been ingested.",
				"``It would have been easy to put it in a cream soup,'' Zimpfer said Saturday.",
				"At Kiev airport, Yushchenko said it should not take too long to reach a conclusion in the attempted murder case. ``A lot of the circumstances are already known,'' he said. ``I think if the general prosecutor acts according to Ukraine's laws, both the country and the world at large will soon know who did this.''",

				"Ukraine was plunged into a political turmoil after the presidential runoff on Nov. 21, when both candidates claimed victory.",

				"US officials say the activities do not amount to interference in Ukraine's election but are part of the 1 billion dollars the US State Department spends each year trying to build democracy worldwide. They say no American funds were sent directly to Ukrainian political parties.",
				"Yanukovych has often accused the United States of meddling in Ukraine's internal affairs.",
				"Meanwhile, Yushchenko, who is popular in the West, called for an investigation to determine how he was poisoned by dioxin, but said it should be conducted after the Dec. 26 re-run to avoid influencing the results.",
				"Doctors at a Vienna clinic in Austria said tests proved beyond doubt that it was dioxin poisoning that caused a mystery illness in September that left Yushchenko disfigured and in pain.",

				"Yushchenko fell ill on Sept. 5 and has been treated at the Vienna clinic twice before.",
				"Hospital director Michael Zimpfer said Yushchenko's blood contained more than 1,000 times the normal amount of dioxin. He said tests showed the toxin was taken orally.",

				""If the prosecutor general keeps to the law and acts accordingly, then soon Ukraine and the whole world will find out who did this," said Yushchenko, who underwent a new round of tests at the clinic over the weekend.",
				"Doctors at the Rudolfinerhaus clinic determined that the pro-West opposition leader was poisoned by ingesting a dioxin dose that exceeded 1,000 times the safe limit -- possibly by eating spiked soup -- causing his face to be disfigured weeks before the first round of a presidential vote.",
				"Yushchenko has previously charged that the hardline regime of outgoing President Leonid Kuchma poisoned him to take him out of the contest against Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovich, whom the opposition leader comfortably led in the polls when he was struck.",
				"On Sunday Yushchenko refused to name any specific officials and said the inquiry should determine the culprit.",
				""This is a very delicate question and one should not be accusing anyone at this point -- this should be determined by the investigation," he said.",
				"Yanukovich said Monday he could not have known anything about the alleged government plot because as prime minister he did not oversee the security structures that could have possibly orchestrated the attack.",

				""I sympathize as a person with Mr Yushchenko that he is sick. I hope that he gets better soon."",
				"The Interfax news agency reported Monday that the prosecutor general's office has re-opened a criminal investigation into the case after closing an earlier inquiry.",
				"Yushchenko will face Yanukovich on December 26 in a rerun vote after the supreme court stripped the prime minister of his victory in the November 21 runoff because of massive ballot fraud.",
				"Before the doctors' confirmation, presidential administration authorities have said that Yushchenko may have fallen ill from eating spoiled food or perhaps drinking too much bad liquor.",
				"In Washington, the White House urged Ukraine to fully investigate the "terrible" poisonin  Meanwhile Yanukovich pressed on with his message that he would no longer represent the ruling regime in the December 26 vote after what he has called Kuchma's "betrayal" of him during the talks with Yushchenko to resolve the standoff over the November 21 poll.",
				""I was deeply disappointed in this man," he told reporters. "This crisis showed his true character and he began defending the interests of himself and his family."",
				""The battle against me is being waged by the old government and people who once served in government... those who robbed Ukraine and drove her people to poverty," he said."
