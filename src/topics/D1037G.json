                " Years of paltry oyster harvests have left Bill Beck, a waterman on Maryland's Eastern Shore for 21 of his 39 years, wondering if the business will exist by the time his 9-year-old son reaches adulthood.", 
                "Harvesting oysters, crabs or rockfish for 10 to 15 hours a day earns Beck just $25,000 a year.", 
                "The dwindling supply of oysters in the Chesapeake Bay -- last season's haul was about 24,000 bushels, less than 1 percent of what it was three decades ago -- has hurt him the most.", 
                "``It's getting worse.", 
                "There's no oysters.", 
                "There's nothing there,'' Beck said.", 
                "Last weekend, three generations of the Beck family -- Bill, son Craig and father John, 76 -- boarded their boat with renewed optimism as nearly 4,000 bushels of disease-free oysters were made available for harvesting for the first time since they were hatched and planted three years ago.", 
                "The Becks were among two dozen watermen, some scuba-diving and some using hand tongs, who set out to get their share of the disease-free oysters from three managed reserves, known as Emory Hollow and Blunts Bar in the Chester River and Bolingbroke Sands in the Choptank River.", 
                "The oysters were spawned at the University of Maryland's Center for Environmental Science, then planted in the managed reserves, where they grew under the supervision of scientists.", 
                "Almost 200 million oysters have been planted since 2001, officials said.", 
                "While watermen have been able to harvest oysters elsewhere, they agreed not to harvest in the managed reserves for several years until the majority of the oysters grew to four inches, one inch bigger than the state's legal size.", 
                "Those oysters command a higher price and have a better chance of reproducing, organizers said.", 
                "In return, state officials promised to open up the oyster bars periodically, particularly around the holidays when demand is higher.", 
                "The watermen will next be able to harvest oysters, which also help filter the water, at the three sites Nov. 13.", 
                "``It's a beautiful concept in a sense because it's brought commercial interests and environmental interests together,'' said William Goldsborough, a senior scientist at the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.", 
                "Yet not everyone left with big bundles of oysters Saturday.", 
                "At Emory Hollow, the seven participating watermen collected just 10 to 15 bushels.", 
                "The nine watermen at the Blunts Bar site fared better, collecting 97 bushels.", 
                "``Terrible,'' Bill Beck said.", 
                "``It took us over an hour to catch a bushel.", 
                "'' The Becks had worked diligently along the Chester River, Bill Beck dragging a hand tong through the water as his son and father sorted and measured their catch.", 
                "Mathilde Egge, program administrator for the Oyster Recovery Partnership, one of the project managers, said many Emory Hollow oysters were smaller than four inches and couldn't be harvested.", 
                "Organizers would try to determine how to ensure that oystermen take home a bigger haul before the next harvesting, Egge said.", 
                "Several organizations and federal agencies worked together to manage the project, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Oyster Recovery Partnership, a nonprofit group whose mission is to restore the bay's oyster population.", 
                "The managed reserve program is one of many efforts to reverse what scientists have called a disturbing trend.", 
                "Once the Chesapeake Bay's premiere species, native oysters have been virtually wiped out due to over-harvesting and disease.", 
                "In addition to the managed reserve program, some researchers have turned to creating sanctuaries filled with oysters that watermen are barred from harvesting.", 
                "The Maryland Department of Natural Resources also is considering introducing a nonnative -- and, they hope, disease-resistant -- species to the bay.", 
                "Federal funding for oyster restoration efforts in Maryland and Virginia exceeded $4 million this year, organizers of Saturday's event said.", 
                "The managed reserve method is ``the beginning of a new approach to managing oysters and oyster disease,'' said Goldsborough of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.", 
                "David Phillips, 42, a waterman from Wittman, Md., said he welcomes any effort to increase the oyster supply.", 
                "Phillips drove his boat 20 miles to Emory Hollow, a nearly two-hour trip, to participate.", 
                "``I think it's a great opportunity,'' said Phillips, who hopes such efforts will save his profession.", 
                "``It's a dying breed,'' Phillips said.", 
                "``Everybody that was on the water got off the water because you can't make a living.",

                "Most days, the stainless steel sinks and tables inside their shuck house were shining, untouched.", 
                "Leaves yellowed and crab apples fell, and often the radio played country songs to no one, echoing through the empty cinderblock building.", 
                "``We're dead in the water,'' Tucker Brown said.", 
                "The decline of the region's oyster population has changed life on the water, but the Browns keep looking ahead.", 
                "Maybe the government will bring in a new kind of oyster that can survive in the bay.", 
                "Or maybe, once again, they'll think of something new with which to patch their business together.", 
                "For decades, the Browns, like most watermen, have adapted as diseases, pollution and commercial fisheries have taken their toll on the Chesapeake Bay and its rivers.", 
                "Oysters, an important filter for the water and once the mainstay of the region's fishing industry, have been decimated, their numbers dropping to historic lows.", 
                "In the 1970s and '80s, before diseases started their rampant spread through the bay, the average harvest reported to the Maryland Department of Natural Resources was more than 2 million bushels.", 
                "This year, DNR officials expect about 15,000.", 
                "Just a few years ago, there were thousands of people oystering in Maryland; this year, they expect fewer than 150.", 
                "In 1987, the Virginia Marine Resources Commission issued more than 2,000 licenses for oystering; in 2003, it issued about 300.", 
                "And on the Potomac -- famous for its Oyster Wars five or six decades ago, when shots were fired over fishing rights and fast boats slipped past the authorities at night -- little or no harvest is anticipated this year.", 
                "The effects are deeply felt in St. Mary's, where so much of life once revolved around oysters.", 
                "Generations of watermen worked long winter days gathering them; shuckers spent nights cracking them open; families scalded, fried, steamed and ate them.", 
                "At the Blessing of the Fleet, where for decades St. Mary's residents have marked the beginning of the season, there were hardly any workboats to sanctify this year.", 
                "And at the recent St. Mary's County Oyster Festival, which draws thousands and crowns a national shucking champion, organizers had to ship in shellfish from Texas and Louisiana.", 
                "In the past two years, the Browns have shifted more and more to buying from the Gulf of Mexico.", 
                "This year, even the gulf couldn't fill their early orders after heavy rains closed some oyster beds.", 
                "By early next year, state and federal agencies expect to complete research on restoring the native oyster to the Chesapeake Bay.", 
                "The studies will also examine the potential impact of introducing a new species of oyster that appears resistant to the diseases.", 
                "Some scientists worry they won't have answers that quickly, but the Browns are tired of waiting.", 
                "``If something goes wrong, what's any worse than what we've got?", 
                "'' Tucker Brown asked.", 
                "He said if the scientists don't start putting the non-native oyster into Maryland waters soon, someone else could throw some overboard.",

                "``We are not going to introduce an oyster that we have questions about,'' said Secretary of Natural Resources Ronald Franks.", 
                "The two states' criticism marks a new turn in the saga of Crassostrea Ariakensis, a native of China that has recently caused unusual divisions within the staid world of shellfish management.", 
                "It has emerged as an issue now because the native oyster -- crucial to filtering the bay's waters and supporting its fleet of watermen -- has almost vanished from the Chesapeake.", 
                "Last year's native oyster harvest was about 23,000 bushels, less than 1 percent of the figure 30 years ago.", 
                "``We're so low that the next stop is zero,'' said Pete Jensen, an official with the Department of Natural Resources.", 
                "The Asian oysters are believed to be resistant to the diseases that have killed off native oysters in the Chesapeake.", 
                "But scientists believe there are many potential downsides -- even beyond the dinner-table prospects of an oyster that can resemble an orange portobello mushroom cap.", 
                "Scientists point to the havoc caused in the bay ecosystem by other nonnative species: The mute swan and beaverlike nutria chew up crucial grasses, and the toothy northern snakehead has worried fishermen in the Potomac River.", 
                "They worry that the Asian oysters could bring new diseases or adapt to the Chesapeake so well that they squeeze out native species of oysters and clams.", 
                "To answer such questions fully might take many years of research, according to reports by the National Academy of Sciences and a trio of federal agencies: the U.S.", 
                "Fish and Wildlife Service, Environmental Protection Agency and National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration.", 
                "Julie Thompson, a biologist with the Fish and Wildlife Service, said Wednesday that the federal agencies were concerned that the Asian oyster would be impossible to remove once released in the wild.", 
                "``After it's done, it's going to be irreversible,'' she said.", 
                "Franks said Wednesday that all the necessary research has been compressed into a year.", 
                "That study, performed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, could be finished in the next couple of weeks, he said.", 
                "After that, Franks said, the data will be reviewed by a panel of experts appointed by Ehrlich and Virginia Gov.", 
                "Mark R. Warner (D).", 
                "Based on their recommendations, Ehrlich and Warner will decide whether to move forward on the oysters or to request more research, Franks said.", 
                "Delaware and New Jersey will not have a say. "

                "Monday's annual meeting, at a conference center on the grounds of Mount Vernon, Va., provided a chance for officials from Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to assess the bay's health.", 
                "All noted some signs of progress: a new ``flush tax'' to improve sewer facilities in Maryland and rivers in Pennsylvania that have been reopened to migrating fish.", 
                "But most also said the cleanup effort was not close to meeting a self-imposed deadline of a healthy bay by 2010.", 
                "That goal, set in the landmark Chesapeake 2000 agreement five years ago, would require huge reductions that have yet to be seen in several pollutants.", 
                "In fact, experts say by some measures -- such as the declining oyster population and large areas of oxygen-poor ``bad water'' -- the bay seems to be getting worse.", 
                "``Without major funding, there's no way we're going to meet that 2010 goal,'' said Pennsylvania Gov.", 
                "Edward G. Rendell (D), the council's new chairman.", 
                "The regional financing authority was proposed late last year by a panel of experts chaired by former Virginia Gov.", 
                "Gerald L. Baliles (D).", 
                "It called for a central authority with 20 percent of its funding drawn from state sources and 80 percent from the federal government.", 
                "As drawn up by the Baliles panel, the federal commitment would be spread over time, beginning with $1 billion this year and building to $2.5 billion in 2010.", 
                "That would be a major increase over current funding for the bay, which Warner estimated at $230 million annually.", 
                "As lobbying efforts begin, the executive council voted to create a panel of experts which would report back by July1 with details on how the regional financing authority might be created.", 
                "Before the meeting, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation led a rally in which speakers accused government officials of dragging their feet on bay cleanup measures.", 
                "William C. Baker, the environmentalist group's president, spoke from a podium emblazoned with the slogan ``Stop the Delay.", 
                "Save the Bay.", 
                "'' ``Solutions are available.", 
                "The bay can be saved,'' Baker said.", 
                "``All that is lacking is the political will to get on with the job.",

                " Chesapeake Bay seafood processors say they're facing catastrophe this year because a cap on certain ``guest workers'' is keeping out immigrants who usually pick crabs and shuck oysters.", 
                "These migrant workers have come to dominate shellfish processing over the past decade -- doing dirty, repetitive work that machines can't and Americans won't, employers say.", 
                "But this year, the seasonal-work visa program that provides these laborers hit its limit of 66,000 workers on the earliest date ever, Jan. 3.", 
                "That has left many businesses empty-handed, including ski resorts in New England, fish plants in Washington state, and dozens of processors in Maryland and Virginia.", 
                "``People suddenly woke up to the fact that they're going to be out of business this spring,'' said Bill Sieling, executive director of the Chesapeake Bay Seafood Industries Association, which represents seafood plants around the bay.", 
                "In all, Sieling said, about 20 plants -- all on the Eastern Shore -- were unable to get the workers they applied for.", 
                "Added together, their requests totaled about 800 workers, he said.", 
                "Now, members of Congress up and down the East Coast are lobbying for the cap on guest workers to be raised.", 
                "And seafood processors are scrambling to find other workers or face shutting down for the season -- and possibly for good.", 
                "``When the crabs start running in the summer ... and you don't have this infrastructure to pick them anymore, it's going to be bad,'' said Jack Brooks, president of the J.M.", 
                "Clayton seafood company in Cambridge, Md.", 
                "His firm usually has about 30 immigrant workers.", 
                "But some immigration experts say lifting the cap on laborers isn't the solution.", 
                "Mark Krikorian, of the Center for Immigration Studies, said that shellfish processors either should pay wages high enough to attract American workers or invent a way to mechanize the work.", 
                "``The presence of these foreign workers creates a dependency'' among employers, Krikorian said.", 
                "``It's hard to wean away from it.", 
                "'' The visa program at issue, known as H-2B, allows workers to enter the country for seasonal work outside of agriculture and then return home.", 
                "Before bringing in a worker under this program, an employer must prove that no U.S. residents are willing to do the job.", 
                "The program has become more popular across the country in recent years and has been used to fill jobs from lawn care workers to lifeguards.", 
                "It has become particularly valuable around the bay, where the process of removing crab and oyster meat from shells is still done largely by hand.", 
                "The work is unpleasant.", 
                "Picking crabs, for instance, requires scraping off the cooked crab's gills, cleaning out its organs, breaking off the mouth and prying meat out of tiny cavities.", 
                "All that must be repeated up to 600 times a day, yielding a daily wage that might reach $120 on a good day, Brooks said.", 
                "That amounts to 20 cents a crab.", 
                "Adding to the undesirability in these jobs, experts say, is the fact that in recent years they have changed from year-round to seasonal because there no longer are enough shellfish in the polluted bay to sustain them.", 
                "As a result, experts say, a once-large labor pool has vanished as local workers found better jobs.", 
                "``There's no one else,'' said Karen Oertel, of W.H.", 
                "Harris Seafood House in Chester, Md.", 
                "``Nobody shucks an oyster anymore.", 
                "'' The shellfish processors turned to the H-2B program, bringing in hundreds of Mexicans and other immigrants to spend several months in the plants.", 
                "About 90 percent of Maryland's crab meat is produced by plants using H-2B workers, said Douglas Lipton, a professor of resource management at the University of Maryland.", 
                "But Chesapeake processors say a quirk of the program puts them at a disadvantage.", 
                "The window for applications opens in October, but employers can apply no more than four months before they need workers.", 
                "Seafood plants do not need help until April.", 
                "When they applied this year, many of the plants were shut out, officials say.", 
                "One of them was the Graham and Rollins plant in Hampton, Va., which asked for 100 guest workers and received none.", 
                "Without immigrant workers, John Graham said, he has only about 18 local laborers.", 
                "``I need at least 80 to open the doors,'' Graham said.", 
                "``We are totally dependent on this system,'' he said of the H-2B program. "

                "These spat are grown in a bath of water taken from the Choptank River, with their food sometimes supplemented by specially grown algae.", 
                "They are then transported to laboratories and oyster-seeding programs around the state.", 
                "The laboratory's work with the Asian oyster, Crassostrea ariakensis,@ is part of a larger scientific and political debate.", 
                "Some officials in Maryland look to the Asian oyster as a potential replacement for the native oyster, which has been decimated by disease and pollution.", 
                "But others, including several state legislators and federal scientists, have said that much more research is needed before the Asian oyster can be certified as safe for the bay.", 
                "At the Horn Point Lab, Meritt said, researchers are trying to determine whether the Asian oyster's reproduction would interfere with the reproduction of the native oyster, and how well it would fare in the less-salty waters of the upper Chesapeake. "

                "Combined, these factors have caused a stunning decline in Maryland oyster harvests: from about 2,600,000 bushels in 1974-75 to about 26,000 bushels last year.", 
                "In desperation, the two bay states have turned to the Chinese oyster, which has been grown for about 30 years in Oregon and is believed to be immune to the Chesapeake's oyster diseases.", 
                "The hope is that the new species could take the native oyster's former role in the bay: as a moneymaker for watermen and a natural filter for polluted water.", 
                "As optimism about the new oyster has grown in the administration of Maryland Gov.", 
                "Robert Ehrlich, a Republican, pessimism has spread among scientists.", 
                "Among their questions: Will the new oyster bring a new disease?", 
                "Will it multiply so rapidly that it overtakes native species?", 
                "Will it fail to multiply and instead die, leaving the bay no better off?", 
                "Previous outside studies have warned that perhaps more years of research are necessary before the oyster can be declared safe.", 
                "But Maryland and Virginia have held the hope that the one-year study underway by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will be sufficient.", 
                "When the results are released this summer, they will be forwarded to an independent committee for an evaluation that is expected to take six weeks, said Pete Jensen, an official with the Maryland Department of Natural Resources. "

                " Teeming with raw sewage, animal waste and fertilizer runoff, yet responsible for half the Chesapeake Bay's fresh water, the Susquehanna River is the most endangered river in the United States, according to a report released this week by American Rivers, a national conservation group.", 
                "Pennsylvania's massive Susquehanna, the bay's biggest tributary, tops a list of 10 American rivers with uncertain futures, including Ohio's Little Miami River, Tennessee's Roan Creek and South Carolina's Santee River.", 
                "Most of them, said American Rivers President Rebecca R. Wodder, are befouled by raw sewage and urban and farm runoff -- problems made worse by population growth and cuts to federal cleanup money.", 
                "The Susquehanna exemplifies ``the crisis we're highlighting in this report, that when it rains in America, raw sewage pours into our rivers and streams -- in an increasing amount,'' she said.", 
                "Uphill and upstream from the bay, thousands of acres of Pennsylvania crop- and pastureland abut the banks of the Susquehanna or the creeks and streams that feed it.", 
                "The farms are so small and far-flung that state environmental agencies struggle to bring all of them into compliance with laws governing pollutant runoff.", 
                "The report also cites runoff from urban centers and the hundreds of sewer pipes that overflow in rainy weather, spewing human waste and garbage into the river.", 
                "Fertilizer nutrients and filth from the Susquehanna is a chief cause of the algae blooms and pollution that suck oxygen from the Chesapeake Bay, decimating crab, oyster, fish and aquatic plant populations.", 
                "A University of Maryland consultant has estimated that the river contributes 40 percent of the nitrogen and 20 percent of the phosphorus -- two key ingredients in fertilizers -- to the bay.", 
                "``Pennsylvania is committed to reducing the nutrients and sediments that flow into our local streams and, in doing that, restoring the Chesapeake Bay,'' said Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection spokesman Charlie Young.", 
                "``But the federal government is talking about reducing the amount of (water cleanup money) that goes to Pennsylvania by almost $25 million'' next year, he said.", 
                "Among state-funded cleanup efforts has been a $250 million bond issue last year to pay for sewage treatment plant upgrades, Young said.", 
                "This year, Gov.", 
                "Edward G. Rendell, D, is backing a proposal in the state legislature to issue another $800 million in bonds for water and sewage system improvements, to be voted on in coming days.", 
                "Wodder said federal cuts to Pennsylvania's cleanup budget reflect the situation nationally.", 
                "For example, she said, the Bush administration's proposed 2006 budget calls for cutting spending on the federal clean-water fund to $730 million, from $1.1 billion last year.", 
                "``The feds are not contributing their fair share to solving the problem,'' she said.", 
                "Benjamin Grumbles, assistant administrator for water at the Environmental Protection Agency, said the pared-back funding of $730 million in the president's budget request ``is part of a multi-year effort to commit $6.8 billion through 2011'' to the fund, which he said is intended to provide seed money to state-based loan programs to improve sewage treatment infrastructure.", 
                "Overall, Grumbles said, the EPA favors more state-based water quality initiatives and ``innovative'' programs to combat pollution, such as pollution credits, which can be traded among top-polluting industries. "
