				"On a crystal clear afternoon, the light air hinting of fall, the Miss Brandy motored up to a dock on the Kent Narrows in Grasonville, Md., in front of W.H. Harris Seafood. Heaped like a pile of rocks in the middle of the boat was the morning's haul -- oysters, the rough and craggy bottom dwellers that have been the shining jewels of the Chesapeake Bay for generations.",
				"From the dock, Jason Ruth, a worker at Harris', began culling the pile with an expert's eye, selecting those to keep and shuck and those to return to the bay. Taking handfuls at a time, Ruth flung the oysters back into the water. \"See,\" he said, picking up one in a fluid motion and knocking it with a quick tap against the pile, making a hollow thunk. \"There's nothing there. It's dead. Gone.\" The shell landed back in the water with a splash.",
				"Similar scenes are unfolding these days up and down the Chesapeake Bay, where the annual oyster season is becoming an endangered tradition. For centuries, the Chesapeake has been synonymous with oysters. For early settlers, oyster reefs were so abundant that they posed a hazard for navigation, and with the introduction of canning in the 1800s, the Chesapeake became the source for oysters around the world.",
				"But the annual good cheer surrounding the season is waning. That is because Chesapeake watermen pulled an all-time low of about 25,000 bushels of oysters from the bay last year, compared with 80,000 in 1993 -- and a staggering 15 million back in the glory days of 1885. From 1920 to 1970, before the oyster began its rapid decline, the industry contributed $65 million annually to the state of Maryland, a figure that didn't include the tourism it attracted. The annual figure has fallen to $500,000. Overharvesting and pollution have taken a toll on the native oyster, but far bigger threats to the species are two parasites that attack them, Dermo and MSX, which were first detected in the bay in the 1960s.",
				"Harris' is a holdout in a devastated industry; one of the last oyster-packing companies on the Chesapeake, where once there were hundreds. Just a few miles across the Chesapeake Bay Bridge from Annapolis, the waters of Kent Narrows, which leads to the bay, were home to 13 oyster packing houses at about the time Harris' opened in 1947. Now, it stands alone in the shadow of the Kent Narrows Bridge.",
				"But some oysters do survive in the bay. Harris' shucks, packs and sells them at its packing company and serves them in its dockside restaurant overlooking the narrows. At the height of oyster season, which began Oct. 1 and runs through the end of March, Harris' rolls out an all-you-can-eat buffet, featuring oysters served seven different ways.",
				"Indeed, fall oyster celebrations still abound in bayside communities on the Chesapeake, where old traditions die hard and the oysters remain as much a symbol of the season's arrival as cider, apples and pumpkins. Here, the mighty oyster is toasted in the wood-paneled oyster bars of Annapolis -- McGarvey's, O'Brien's and the Middleton Tavern -- and honored along the bay's shores at festivals, shucking contests and skipjack races.",
				"The events spotlighting oysters in October and November unfold like oysters on the half shell -- by the dozen. There are Tilghman Island Day, the J. Millard Tawes Oyster and Bull Roast in Crisfield, the St. Michaels Oysterfest, the Urbanna Oyster Festival, and the biggest pearl of them all for oyster lovers _the St. Mary's County Oyster Festival this weekend, home to the National Oyster Shucking Championship and National Oyster Cook-Off Contest. The festival features oysters in every imaginable combination: raw, steamed, fried or Rockefeller; stewed in chowder or mixed with cocktail sauce; or served with a swig of beer in a shot glass.",
				"It is possible, too, to celebrate the season with a quieter sojourn, steering clear of the crowded festivals and venturing into sleepier coastal communities. From the Kent Narrows, they are a quick jaunt to the far side of the Chesapeake, heading south and east on Route 50, down the thumb print of land dangling between the bay and the Atlantic.",
				"This route is frequently clogged with traffic headed toward the Atlantic Coast and Maryland's Eastern Shore in the summer months, but fewer people stop to explore the other stretch of coast, along the Chesapeake Bay. The towns along the peninsula's west coast, places like St. Michaels, Oxford and Crisfield, aren't easy to reach down twisting two-lane roads that dead end at the water's edge.",
				"The small flecks of black that mark them on a map can persuade those short on time or unwise in the ways of the bay to save the detour for another day. But if you turn off Route 50 at Easton, and cut west toward the bay, the road quickly gives way to farmland, brown and drying corn stalks, pumpkin patches and fields dipped in gold at the hands of fall before opening onto the water.",
				"Past Easton and St. Michaels, Tilghman Island is one of those flecks, set on the tip of a peninsula connected to the mainland by a drawbridge across Knapp's Narrows. At the clanging of a bell, every 20 minutes or so, cars stop and the bridge slowly lifts as if raising a hand in greeting to the boats coming in and out of the harbor. On one side of the bridge is the Bridge Restaurant, which advertises oysters with crab imperial, and the Fairbank Tackle store, which sells tackle, ice and bait. On the other side is Harrison's Oyster Packing, another of the handful of oyster houses still in operation. Farther down the road, Captain Buddy Harrison, who owns the company, also runs the Chesapeake House, offering old-fashioned seafood dining and lodging overlooking the bay.",
				"In Dogwood Harbor on Tilghman, fishing boats still outnumber sailboats and pleasure craft. On a recent Sunday morning, the harbor was peaceful, with only a few watermen cleaning and fixing their boats. In an earlier time, they would have been prepping their dredges for oyster season, but most won't be dredging this year.",
				"Norman Murphy is a middle-aged waterman who grew up on Tilghman Island working the bay, as his own son does now. \"No one here is oystering anymore,\" he said, shaking his head before adding a footnote. \"Well, maybe a few.\"",
				"(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)",
				"Across the harbor from Murphy's slip are a handful of skipjacks -- a vanishing fleet of traditional oyster dredge boats and the last commercial sailing fishing fleet in North America. There were once almost 2,000 of the boats working the bay, but today, they number near 30, with only about 10 used for oystering.",
				"Built at the peak of the oyster rush, in the late 1890s and early years of the 20th century, skipjacks are light, inexpensive boats that can navigate the shallow waters of the bay. They were designed to be agile to make multiple quick passes over an oyster bed, dragging dredges behind them. Today, oystermen use motorboats more than skipjacks, and they employ other methods, too, like hand-tonging and diving.",
				"Many of the remaining skipjacks have become museum pieces, like the Martha Lewis in Baltimore, preserved by the Chesapeake Heritage Conservancy, and the E.C. Collier, now in the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum in St. Michaels.",
				"But lined up in Dogwood Harbor are four majestic skipjacks growing old very, very gracefully, their massive white sails lashed to the masts. They, too, are holdouts, though called upon less and less to dredge.",
				"Wade Murphy, a third-generation waterman with 40 years of oystering behind him, runs charter tours on his skipjack, the Rebecca T. Ruark, built in 1886. Each year the charter business gets bigger and bigger, Murphy said. \"If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be able to keep afloat.\"",
				"Nearby, D.K. Bond was cleaning out his skipjack, the Mister Maybe, with a vision of running his own tours in the summer and hauling down to Florida come winter. \"This boat costs $10,000 a year to keep up,\" Bond said. \"If you spend $10,000 and make $5,000, it doesn't take long for you to get out of it. I'm going to catch tourists instead. It's easier.\"",
				"(END OPTIONAL TRIM)",
				"This grim portrait doesn't mean that there are no oysters left in the Chesapeake. Both Virginia and Maryland have been spending several million dollars each year to restore native populations, and they are considering introducing a heartier nonnative species to the bay.",
				"In 2005, led by the Army Corps of Engineers, the two states are expected to release a draft Environmental Impact Statement evaluating oyster recovery. Also, the Oyster Recovery Partnership, an alliance of organizations, businesses and individuals, has planted more than 330 million disease-free oyster seeds from the University of Maryland's Center for Environmental Science in 33 locations in the bay since 2000. The group aims to harvest the seeded oysters in time to save them from being attacked by Dermo or MSX, within three years.",
				"Nonetheless, the commercial fishery business -- the packing and shipping that put Chesapeake Bay oysters on the map -- has all but collapsed.",
				"But watermen still bring in salty, succulent oysters every year, and those are abundant at bay restaurants, raw bars, seafood stores and festivals. If you ask, you may find the oysters you order are from Long Island or the Gulf of Mexico, but in the height of oyster season, when the annual grind is under way, you are just as likely to get that coveted response, \"from a local oyster bed.\"",
				"In places like Tilghman, watermen still motor up to the dock at Harrison's packing company to deliver their day's haul, just as they have for generations, and inside, shuckers still wait to crack them open in record time, as they, too, have done for generations.",
				"Like the watermen, shuckers are born into this hearty business more often than not. Opening a cold, tenacious oyster quickly without harming or slicing the tender meat within takes skill and gumption. At the height of the season, shuckers line up in the oyster house, don rugged work gloves and pry open the shells, shucking hundreds an hour (they get paid by the pound).",
				"Clevon Tilghman, 53, has been working at Harrison's since he was a boy watching his parents shuck oysters there. \"Young people now don't want to shuck oysters,\" Tilghman said. \"You can tell in the oyster house. We see the old generation that's passed on, and there's no younger one to take their place. It's fading out.\"",
				"WHERE TO GO",
				"The St. Mary's County Oyster Festival, one of the Cheseapeake Bay's largest celebrations, is being held this weekend, Oct. 16-17, at the fairgrounds in Leonardtown, Md.",
				"It features a giant raw oyster bar, cooking demonstrations, live music and an oyster-shucking competition. Admission is $5 over age 12; www.usoysterfest.com.",
				"The Harris Crab House and Seafood Restaurant in Grasonville, Md., offers waterfront dining overlooking Kent Narrows; inside, the Harris family displays an old-fashioned oyster can collection (www.harriscrabhouse.com, 410-827-9500, 433 Kent Narrows Way North).",
				"On Tilghman Island, Harrison's Chesapeake House serves fried oyster sandwiches next to the bay (www.chesapeakehouse.com, 410-886-2121, 21551 Chesapeake House Drive).",
				"The Wades Point Inn, between St. Michaels and Tilghman Island, is a white-columned historic inn on 120 acres with stunning views of Chesapeake Bay (www.wadespoint.com, 410-745-2500, 10090 Wades Point Road, McDaniel, Md.). Room rates range from $140 to $240.",
				"Filled with art galleries, coffee shops and restaurants, the town of Easton makes a good base for exploring the region. The Inn at Easton (www.theinnateaston.com, 410-822-4910, 28 S. Harrison St.) offers luxury accommodations in a Federal mansion in the center of town. The front parlor is home to an acclaimed restaurant whose menu relies on local ingredients. Room rates range from $175 to $395. Easton's Promise (www.eastonspromise.com, 410-820-9159, 107 Goldsborough St.) is a pleasant bed and breakfast with room rates ranging from $100 to $170. "

			"headline":"Watermen Tap Into Oyster Reserve",
			"sentences":[
				"Years of paltry oyster harvests have left Bill Beck, a waterman on Maryland's Eastern Shore for 21 of his 39 years, wondering if the business will exist by the time his 9-year-old son reaches adulthood.",
				"Harvesting oysters, crabs or rockfish for 10 to 15 hours a day earns Beck just $25,000 a year. The dwindling supply of oysters in the Chesapeake Bay -- last season's haul was about 24,000 bushels, less than 1 percent of what it was three decades ago -- has hurt him the most.",
				"``It's getting worse. There's no oysters. There's nothing there,'' Beck said.",
				"Last weekend, three generations of the Beck family -- Bill, son Craig and father John, 76 -- boarded their boat with renewed optimism as nearly 4,000 bushels of disease-free oysters were made available for harvesting for the first time since they were hatched and planted three years ago.",
				"The Becks were among two dozen watermen, some scuba-diving and some using hand tongs, who set out to get their share of the disease-free oysters from three managed reserves, known as Emory Hollow and Blunts Bar in the Chester River and Bolingbroke Sands in the Choptank River. The oysters were spawned at the University of Maryland's Center for Environmental Science, then planted in the managed reserves, where they grew under the supervision of scientists. Almost 200 million oysters have been planted since 2001, officials said.",
				"While watermen have been able to harvest oysters elsewhere, they agreed not to harvest in the managed reserves for several years until the majority of the oysters grew to four inches, one inch bigger than the state's legal size. Those oysters command a higher price and have a better chance of reproducing, organizers said. In return, state officials promised to open up the oyster bars periodically, particularly around the holidays when demand is higher. The watermen will next be able to harvest oysters, which also help filter the water, at the three sites Nov. 13.",
				"``It's a beautiful concept in a sense because it's brought commercial interests and environmental interests together,'' said William Goldsborough, a senior scientist at the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.",
				"Yet not everyone left with big bundles of oysters Saturday. At Emory Hollow, the seven participating watermen collected just 10 to 15 bushels. The nine watermen at the Blunts Bar site fared better, collecting 97 bushels.",
				"``Terrible,'' Bill Beck said. ``It took us over an hour to catch a bushel.'' The Becks had worked diligently along the Chester River, Bill Beck dragging a hand tong through the water as his son and father sorted and measured their catch.",
				"Mathilde Egge, program administrator for the Oyster Recovery Partnership, one of the project managers, said many Emory Hollow oysters were smaller than four inches and couldn't be harvested. Organizers would try to determine how to ensure that oystermen take home a bigger haul before the next harvesting, Egge said.",
				"Several organizations and federal agencies worked together to manage the project, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Oyster Recovery Partnership, a nonprofit group whose mission is to restore the bay's oyster population.",
				"The managed reserve program is one of many efforts to reverse what scientists have called a disturbing trend. Once the Chesapeake Bay's premiere species, native oysters have been virtually wiped out due to over-harvesting and disease. In addition to the managed reserve program, some researchers have turned to creating sanctuaries filled with oysters that watermen are barred from harvesting. The Maryland Department of Natural Resources also is considering introducing a nonnative -- and, they hope, disease-resistant -- species to the bay.",
				"Federal funding for oyster restoration efforts in Maryland and Virginia exceeded $4 million this year, organizers of Saturday's event said.",
				"The managed reserve method is ``the beginning of a new approach to managing oysters and oyster disease,'' said Goldsborough of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.",
				"David Phillips, 42, a waterman from Wittman, Md., said he welcomes any effort to increase the oyster supply. Phillips drove his boat 20 miles to Emory Hollow, a nearly two-hour trip, to participate.",
				"``I think it's a great opportunity,'' said Phillips, who hopes such efforts will save his profession.",
				"``It's a dying breed,'' Phillips said. ``Everybody that was on the water got off the water because you can't make a living.'' "

				"For weeks this fall, even as St. Mary's County celebrated the beginning of oyster season with festivals and contests, Tucker and Agnes Brown couldn't find oysters. Most days, the stainless steel sinks and tables inside their shuck house were shining, untouched.",
				"Leaves yellowed and crab apples fell, and often the radio played country songs to no one, echoing through the empty cinderblock building.",
				"``We're dead in the water,'' Tucker Brown said.",
				"The decline of the region's oyster population has changed life on the water, but the Browns keep looking ahead. Maybe the government will bring in a new kind of oyster that can survive in the bay. Or maybe, once again, they'll think of something new with which to patch their business together.",
				"For decades, the Browns, like most watermen, have adapted as diseases, pollution and commercial fisheries have taken their toll on the Chesapeake Bay and its rivers. Oysters, an important filter for the water and once the mainstay of the region's fishing industry, have been decimated, their numbers dropping to historic lows.",
				"In the 1970s and '80s, before diseases started their rampant spread through the bay, the average harvest reported to the Maryland Department of Natural Resources was more than 2 million bushels. This year, DNR officials expect about 15,000. Just a few years ago, there were thousands of people oystering in Maryland; this year, they expect fewer than 150.",
				"In 1987, the Virginia Marine Resources Commission issued more than 2,000 licenses for oystering; in 2003, it issued about 300. And on the Potomac -- famous for its Oyster Wars five or six decades ago, when shots were fired over fishing rights and fast boats slipped past the authorities at night -- little or no harvest is anticipated this year.",
				"The effects are deeply felt in St. Mary's, where so much of life once revolved around oysters. Generations of watermen worked long winter days gathering them; shuckers spent nights cracking them open; families scalded, fried, steamed and ate them.",
				"At the Blessing of the Fleet, where for decades St. Mary's residents have marked the beginning of the season, there were hardly any workboats to sanctify this year. And at the recent St. Mary's County Oyster Festival, which draws thousands and crowns a national shucking champion, organizers had to ship in shellfish from Texas and Louisiana.",
				"In the past two years, the Browns have shifted more and more to buying from the Gulf of Mexico. This year, even the gulf couldn't fill their early orders after heavy rains closed some oyster beds.",
				"By early next year, state and federal agencies expect to complete research on restoring the native oyster to the Chesapeake Bay. The studies will also examine the potential impact of introducing a new species of oyster that appears resistant to the diseases.",
				"Some scientists worry they won't have answers that quickly, but the Browns are tired of waiting. ``If something goes wrong, what's any worse than what we've got?'' Tucker Brown asked.",
				"He said if the scientists don't start putting the non-native oyster into Maryland waters soon, someone else could throw some overboard.",
				"``We have to try to make it work,'' he said. The bay needs oysters. ``When one part of it dies, you have to figure out, how am I going to get to another part?''",
				"(optional trim starts here)",
				"That's how it's always been in Avenue, a St. Mary's neighborhood with stacks of just-chopped firewood, sheds, wheelbarrows and tarps. St. Patrick Creek curls around the Browns' land, with family and friends living along both shores. People remember favors there.",
				"Tucker Brown grew up a waterman in a family of watermen, and in his 67 years, he said, he's just about tried it all.",
				"He's fished. He's eeled. He's dropped pots for crabs. He's helped move seed out of hatcheries to oyster bars, and he's kept a hand in the Maryland Watermen's Association. He's hopeful about aquaculture.",
				"(optional trim ends here)",
				"Out on the water, the oysters have kept dying.",
				"``It started to dwindle down, and then it just, like -- dropped,'' said Kim Beveridge, 38, the Browns' middle daughter, who works with her parents in the shuck house. ``It dropped so bad. Suddenly, nobody had it. Dad wasn't able to fill his orders.''",
				"This year, even the harvest of gulf oysters was stalled by storms.",
				"``We're desperate,'' Agnes Brown said one morning this fall when people kept calling and knocking on their door, looking for oysters, and the couple spent much of the night driving to deliver bait. ``Some days I sit here, I don't want to do this anymore. ... But you know what's behind you. Just look ahead. ... You find something else to take its place.''",
				"Finally, this week, they got a shipment. On Wednesday morning, shuckers stood on wooden boxes, spraying mud as they pried open oysters, dropping the slippery meat into dripping pails. Beveridge shoveled ice around jars of sealed oysters. Toogie Copsey of Mechanicsville, Md., who works for the Browns, smashed shells down a metal chute with a long pole, clearing space to shuck some more.",
				"Tucker Brown pulled off his rubber apron and gloves to check on the empty shells pouring out as his wife walked in with a clipboard of orders. For now, they're busy. And just in case, they're thinking of ideas for a new business -- another try.",
				"Staff researcher Bobbye Pratt contributed to this report. "

				"Maryland may be rushing crucial research on introducing Asian oysters into the Chesapeake Bay, the states of Delaware and New Jersey said this week, joining several federal agencies in asking that the new species be studied further.",
				"The states issued a statement saying that the Asian oyster is still ``a virtual unknown'' and could bring diseases or other ecological problems that would spread to their coasts.",
				"They urged officials in Maryland, where Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. (R) has been a vocal proponent of the Asian oyster, not to make a decision as scheduled early next year.",
				"``I think their process would benefit from a little more deliberation,'' said Roy Miller, administrator of fisheries for the Delaware Division of Fish and Wildlife.",
				"Maryland officials responded Wednesday that they would not make any moves before they were sure the new oyster is safe.",
				"``We are not going to introduce an oyster that we have questions about,'' said Secretary of Natural Resources Ronald Franks.",
				"The two states' criticism marks a new turn in the saga of Crassostrea Ariakensis, a native of China that has recently caused unusual divisions within the staid world of shellfish management.",
				"It has emerged as an issue now because the native oyster -- crucial to filtering the bay's waters and supporting its fleet of watermen -- has almost vanished from the Chesapeake.",
				"Last year's native oyster harvest was about 23,000 bushels, less than 1 percent of the figure 30 years ago.",
				"``We're so low that the next stop is zero,'' said Pete Jensen, an official with the Department of Natural Resources.",
				"The Asian oysters are believed to be resistant to the diseases that have killed off native oysters in the Chesapeake. But scientists believe there are many potential downsides -- even beyond the dinner-table prospects of an oyster that can resemble an orange portobello mushroom cap.",
				"Scientists point to the havoc caused in the bay ecosystem by other nonnative species: The mute swan and beaverlike nutria chew up crucial grasses, and the toothy northern snakehead has worried fishermen in the Potomac River.",
				"They worry that the Asian oysters could bring new diseases or adapt to the Chesapeake so well that they squeeze out native species of oysters and clams.",
				"To answer such questions fully might take many years of research, according to reports by the National Academy of Sciences and a trio of federal agencies: the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Environmental Protection Agency and National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration.",
				"Julie Thompson, a biologist with the Fish and Wildlife Service, said Wednesday that the federal agencies were concerned that the Asian oyster would be impossible to remove once released in the wild.",
				"``After it's done, it's going to be irreversible,'' she said.",
				"Franks said Wednesday that all the necessary research has been compressed into a year. That study, performed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, could be finished in the next couple of weeks, he said.",
				"After that, Franks said, the data will be reviewed by a panel of experts appointed by Ehrlich and Virginia Gov. Mark R. Warner (D).",
				"Based on their recommendations, Ehrlich and Warner will decide whether to move forward on the oysters or to request more research, Franks said.",
				"Delaware and New Jersey will not have a say. "

			"sentences":[
				"The leaders of several states in the Chesapeake Bay watershed agreed Monday to lobby Capitol Hill for about $12 billion for cleaning up the bay.",
				"The Chesapeake Executive Council, a group of state and federal officials overseeing the bay cleanup, voted to support a new central financing authority with the power to disperse billions to various Chesapeake-related projects. The idea is to jump-start the massive cleanup effort, which critics say has been bogged down because of excessive bureaucracy and insufficient funding.",
				"But supporting the financing authority doesn't make it so: There's still the matter of persuading Congress to come up with the bulk of the $15 billion needed to pay for the plan.",
				"Virginia Gov. Mark R. Warner (D), the Chesapeake executive council's outgoing chairman, said the lobbying effort would begin soon.",
				"``We will be up in the halls of Congress within the next 45 days to lobby for the additional federal support,'' Warner said. He said the Chesapeake officials had been told to wait until after last fall's national elections to launch their efforts.",
				"Monday's annual meeting, at a conference center on the grounds of Mount Vernon, Va., provided a chance for officials from Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to assess the bay's health.",
				"All noted some signs of progress: a new ``flush tax'' to improve sewer facilities in Maryland and rivers in Pennsylvania that have been reopened to migrating fish.",
				"But most also said the cleanup effort was not close to meeting a self-imposed deadline of a healthy bay by 2010.",
				"That goal, set in the landmark Chesapeake 2000 agreement five years ago, would require huge reductions that have yet to be seen in several pollutants. In fact, experts say by some measures -- such as the declining oyster population and large areas of oxygen-poor ``bad water'' -- the bay seems to be getting worse.",
				"``Without major funding, there's no way we're going to meet that 2010 goal,'' said Pennsylvania Gov. Edward G. Rendell (D), the council's new chairman.",
				"The regional financing authority was proposed late last year by a panel of experts chaired by former Virginia Gov. Gerald L. Baliles (D). It called for a central authority with 20 percent of its funding drawn from state sources and 80 percent from the federal government.",
				"As drawn up by the Baliles panel, the federal commitment would be spread over time, beginning with $1 billion this year and building to $2.5 billion in 2010.",
				"That would be a major increase over current funding for the bay, which Warner estimated at $230 million annually.",
				"As lobbying efforts begin, the executive council voted to create a panel of experts which would report back by July1 with details on how the regional financing authority might be created.",
				"Before the meeting, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation led a rally in which speakers accused government officials of dragging their feet on bay cleanup measures.",
				"William C. Baker, the environmentalist group's president, spoke from a podium emblazoned with the slogan ``Stop the Delay. Save the Bay.''",
				"``Solutions are available. The bay can be saved,'' Baker said. ``All that is lacking is the political will to get on with the job.'' "

			"headline":"Cap on Migrant Workers Hits Seafood Processors",
			"sentences":[
				"Chesapeake Bay seafood processors say they're facing catastrophe this year because a cap on certain ``guest workers'' is keeping out immigrants who usually pick crabs and shuck oysters.",
				"These migrant workers have come to dominate shellfish processing over the past decade -- doing dirty, repetitive work that machines can't and Americans won't, employers say.",
				"But this year, the seasonal-work visa program that provides these laborers hit its limit of 66,000 workers on the earliest date ever, Jan. 3.",
				"That has left many businesses empty-handed, including ski resorts in New England, fish plants in Washington state, and dozens of processors in Maryland and Virginia.",
				"``People suddenly woke up to the fact that they're going to be out of business this spring,'' said Bill Sieling, executive director of the Chesapeake Bay Seafood Industries Association, which represents seafood plants around the bay.",
				"In all, Sieling said, about 20 plants -- all on the Eastern Shore -- were unable to get the workers they applied for. Added together, their requests totaled about 800 workers, he said.",
				"Now, members of Congress up and down the East Coast are lobbying for the cap on guest workers to be raised. And seafood processors are scrambling to find other workers or face shutting down for the season -- and possibly for good.",
				"``When the crabs start running in the summer ... and you don't have this infrastructure to pick them anymore, it's going to be bad,'' said Jack Brooks, president of the J.M. Clayton seafood company in Cambridge, Md. His firm usually has about 30 immigrant workers.",
				"But some immigration experts say lifting the cap on laborers isn't the solution.",
				"Mark Krikorian, of the Center for Immigration Studies, said that shellfish processors either should pay wages high enough to attract American workers or invent a way to mechanize the work.",
				"``The presence of these foreign workers creates a dependency'' among employers, Krikorian said. ``It's hard to wean away from it.''",
				"The visa program at issue, known as H-2B, allows workers to enter the country for seasonal work outside of agriculture and then return home. Before bringing in a worker under this program, an employer must prove that no U.S. residents are willing to do the job.",
				"The program has become more popular across the country in recent years and has been used to fill jobs from lawn care workers to lifeguards. It has become particularly valuable around the bay, where the process of removing crab and oyster meat from shells is still done largely by hand.",
				"The work is unpleasant. Picking crabs, for instance, requires scraping off the cooked crab's gills, cleaning out its organs, breaking off the mouth and prying meat out of tiny cavities.",
				"All that must be repeated up to 600 times a day, yielding a daily wage that might reach $120 on a good day, Brooks said. That amounts to 20 cents a crab. Adding to the undesirability in these jobs, experts say, is the fact that in recent years they have changed from year-round to seasonal because there no longer are enough shellfish in the polluted bay to sustain them.",
				"As a result, experts say, a once-large labor pool has vanished as local workers found better jobs.",
				"``There's no one else,'' said Karen Oertel, of W.H. Harris Seafood House in Chester, Md. ``Nobody shucks an oyster anymore.''",
				"The shellfish processors turned to the H-2B program, bringing in hundreds of Mexicans and other immigrants to spend several months in the plants. About 90 percent of Maryland's crab meat is produced by plants using H-2B workers, said Douglas Lipton, a professor of resource management at the University of Maryland.",
				"But Chesapeake processors say a quirk of the program puts them at a disadvantage. The window for applications opens in October, but employers can apply no more than four months before they need workers. Seafood plants do not need help until April.",
				"When they applied this year, many of the plants were shut out, officials say. One of them was the Graham and Rollins plant in Hampton, Va., which asked for 100 guest workers and received none.",
				"Without immigrant workers, John Graham said, he has only about 18 local laborers. ``I need at least 80 to open the doors,'' Graham said. ``We are totally dependent on this system,'' he said of the H-2B program. "

			"sentences":[
				"Halfway through a 10-year program to save the Chesapeake Bay, political leaders are acknowledging that the vaunted cleanup is faltering and are calling for major changes midstream.",
				"Once touted as a national model, the cleanup effort has unraveled into what some environmentalists call a bureaucratic farce. Five years of planning, they say, have left the bay no cleaner than it was when the ``Chesapeake 2000'' pact was signed.",
				"A Maryland congressman is contemplating legislation to replace the voluntary cleanup strategy with strict regulatory requirements. Governors are pledging to walk the halls of Congress lobbying for $12 billion in needed support. And scientists are exploring the mass introduction of a Chinese oyster to replace the vanishing native breed.",
				"``Business as usual won't work,'' said former Virginia Gov. Gerald Baliles, who led a committee that studied the bay cleanup last year. ``More of the same is asking for trouble.''",
				"The agreement to clean the bay in 10 years promised twice as much underwater grass, 10 times as many oysters, and water as pristine as in the 1950s. It was touted as ``America's premier watershed restoration partnership,'' supported by the Environmental Protection Agency and representatives from Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C.",
				"Thirteen years before, the same entities had pledged to reduce the pollutants nitrogen and phosphorus in the bay by 40 percent. When the deadline came in 2000, they had fallen short.",
				"The new agreement, an attempt to jump-start the effort, made more sweeping promises.",
				"The idea was, ``if we can do this ... nobody else in the world has an excuse,'' said William Matuszeski, who was then overseeing the bay cleanup for the EPA.",
				"It was a daunting task: to reduce pollution spewing from a multitude of city sewers, farms and factories across a 64,000-square-mile watershed. The tools were unwieldy, including several federal agencies and an array of state governments that eventually included Delaware, West Virginia and New York.",
				"Even so, cleanup officials say, they expected to accomplish more by now than they have.",
				"``We've made only modest progress,'' Rebecca Hanmer, head of the EPA bay program, conceded in a recent interview.",
				"Consider:",
				"-- The 2000 agreement targeted the problem of low dissolved oxygen, a condition in which fish and crabs can't breathe. This would mean reducing nitrogen and phosphorus, found in suburban lawn fertilizer, processed sewage and animal manure. These pollutants, when washed downstream to the bay, feed algae blooms that suck oxygen out of the water.",
				"But at the current rate, the nitrogen goal won't be met until 2038, and problems with oxygen-poor areas haven't changed. The summer of 2003 was one of the worst on record, as nearly 40 percent of the Chesapeake became a suffocating expanse that environmentalists dubbed the ``dead zone.''",
				"-- The agreement promised to increase the number of oysters tenfold. Instead, their numbers have fallen off sharply because of pollution, low oxygen and endemic disease. In five years alone, the Maryland oyster harvest has dropped 92 percent, hitting a record low last year with 26,000 bushels.",
				"-- Underwater grasses are supposed to grow to 185,000 acres by 2010. But algae and sediment cloud the water, blocking sunlight. A survey of the bay's grasses in 2003, found about 64,000 acres -- 35 percent of the goal.",
				"Some scientists and watermen say the bay shows few signs that anybody has spent five years trying to save it.",
				"``There really hasn't been a noticeable improvement,'' said Denise Breitburg, a senior scientist at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center in Edgewater, Md. ``The major problems that the Chesapeake Bay agreement was designed to diminish are still there.''",
				"The Chesapeake Bay Foundation assesses the bay's overall health annually and rates it on a 100-point scale. In 2000, the foundation rated the bay a 28.",
				"Since then, the rating has changed -- to 27.",
				"``I wouldn't hold it up as a success story, put it that way,'' said ecologist Robert Howarth of Cornell University.",
				"(Begin optional trim)",
				"The consequences are even more troubling for watermen, for whom the bay provides both a livelihood and cultural touchstone.",
				"Douglas Jenkins Sr., 70, of Virginia's Northern Neck, said he's seen the signs both on land -- where the number of watermen has dropped because of low oyster harvests -- and in the water.",
				"For instance, boat anchors used to come up with a menagerie of tiny bottom-dwelling animals crawling on them: sand fleas, worms, snails. Those animals are gone, and probably dead, Jenkins said.",
				"``The little shells or carcasses are about all you see,'' Jenkins said.",
				"(End trim)",
				"How did the bay get to this condition? Experts say the problem was a desire to plan all pollution efforts in minute detail while keeping major changes on hold.",
				"Matuszeski, the bay program's leader from 1991 to 2001, said officials knew their work would revolve around renovating sewage plants and keeping farm manure out of streams.",
				"But first, the bay cleanup bureaucracy worked on official water standards -- figuring out exactly how clean the bay should be. That process was supposed to take one year. It took three, with Washington, the states and the federal government spending a combined $1 billion a year.",
				"Then individual jurisdictions were to write detailed plans for cleaning up each tributary. The plans, due by 2002, still aren't finished.",
				"``We could have gotten to work,'' Matuszeski said. ``It didn't happen because people were afraid that we didn't have the numbers right.''",
				"Some environmentalists say this planning marathon was actually stalling to allow politicians to avoid changes that would anger farmers and sewage customers.",
				"Hanmer, the EPA's bay director, defended the work, saying it's been slow but necessary for all the cooperating agencies to buy in. ``Now people cannot say, 'Rebecca, we don't know what needs to be done,' '' she said.",
				"Hanmer pointed to some recent successes, including Maryland's passage of a ``flush tax'' to reduce pollution from sewage plants and the EPA's requirement that plants must further clean the water they dump into the watershed.",
				"But even she wouldn't say the cleanup effort is on pace to meet the 2010 deadline.",
				"``I'm certainly not going to tell you that we can't meet it,'' Hanmer said. ``I don't think it's the right message to send.''",
				"Rep. Wayne Gilchrest, R-Md., doesn't want to wait for 2010. Gilchrest wants legislation that would force the cleanup to spend less time on bureaucracy, as well as stronger regulations and punishment for those who pollute, he said.",
				"``What we want to do is lock in a better bay program that will be a hundred times more effective,'' Gilchrest said. Still, he said, it might be two years before the changes go through.",
				"State governors from around the watershed have approved a proposal that would create a massive new pool of funding for the bay, with $12 billion from the federal government. But many observers wonder how the states will get the money since the federal government is already tightening budgets.",
				"Then there is the Chinese oyster, which governors in Maryland and Virginia believe might resist disease and provide a natural pollution filter. Already there is no shortage of opposition to this plan. Scientists worry it will bring in disease; based on their concerns, Maryland state legislators are trying to block it.",
				"The failures leave a bewildering disconnect for those who are removed from the nitty-gritty of environmental policy. On paper is the bay as national treasure, on the way to resurrection. Then there's the bay they know -- sickly and murky and perhaps getting worse.",
				"(Begin optional add end)",
				"It's made Jenkins, the Northern Neck waterman, skeptical of all deadlines for the Chesapeake's comeback.",
				"``It was going to be the '90s ... then the year 2000, then it was the year 2010,'' he said. ``When 2010 gets here, I guess it'll be 2020.'' "

				"The University of Maryland's Horn Point Laboratory in Cambridge, Md., is home to research on the Chesapeake Bay's native oyster, Crassostrea virginica,@ and an Asian oyster that some officials want to introduce into the bay.",
				"Donald Meritt, a scientist there, said that each year the lab produces about 100 million tiny native oysters, which are called spat. These spat are grown in a bath of water taken from the Choptank River, with their food sometimes supplemented by specially grown algae. They are then transported to laboratories and oyster-seeding programs around the state.",
				"The laboratory's work with the Asian oyster, Crassostrea ariakensis,@ is part of a larger scientific and political debate. Some officials in Maryland look to the Asian oyster as a potential replacement for the native oyster, which has been decimated by disease and pollution. But others, including several state legislators and federal scientists, have said that much more research is needed before the Asian oyster can be certified as safe for the bay.",
				"At the Horn Point Lab, Meritt said, researchers are trying to determine whether the Asian oyster's reproduction would interfere with the reproduction of the native oyster, and how well it would fare in the less-salty waters of the upper Chesapeake. "

				"A decision about whether to introduce a new species of Chinese oyster into the Chesapeake Bay has been put off a few months longer because of delays in a scientific study, Maryland officials say.",
				"The study, by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, is intended to guide the governors of Virginia and Maryland as they decide whether to allow the oyster Crassostrea ariakensis@ to reproduce in the Chesapeake. First expected this month at the latest, the report is now due in June or July because of a delay in creating a computer model of how the oysters might spread and reproduce, officials said.",
				"The prospect of a new oyster is already stirring controversy, though. In Annapolis, Md., several state legislators have been pushing bills that would delay any oyster introduction to allow for more research. The worry, said Maryland Del. Peter Franchot is that the new oyster, which can grow to a mammoth eight inches across, will bring ``eight-inch viruses.''",
				"The oyster debate is part of a larger, multibillion-dollar struggle to return the bay to its 1950s condition by 2010. Environmentalists say the effort has been consumed by bureaucracy that has allowed the bay to decay further.",
				"Among the bay's problems, one of the worst has been the decline of the native oyster Crassostrea virginica,@ once so populous that its reefs poked out of the water. Even after European colonization, its harvests were bountiful enough that the Eastern Shore town of Crisfield, Md., was built on a foundation of discarded oyster shells.",
				"But over the past three decades, the bay's oysters have been ravaged by pollution and a pair of diseases.",
				"The pollution, from farms and sewage plants across the bay's 64,000-square-mile watershed, causes algae blooms that suck oxygen from the water. Oysters, unlike fish and crabs, can't swim away from ``bad water'' areas, so they are weakened or killed.",
				"The diseases, one of them introduced when another strain of Asian oyster was placed in the bay decades ago, kill oysters before they grow large.",
				"Combined, these factors have caused a stunning decline in Maryland oyster harvests: from about 2,600,000 bushels in 1974-75 to about 26,000 bushels last year.",
				"In desperation, the two bay states have turned to the Chinese oyster, which has been grown for about 30 years in Oregon and is believed to be immune to the Chesapeake's oyster diseases. The hope is that the new species could take the native oyster's former role in the bay: as a moneymaker for watermen and a natural filter for polluted water.",
				"As optimism about the new oyster has grown in the administration of Maryland Gov. Robert Ehrlich, a Republican, pessimism has spread among scientists. Among their questions: Will the new oyster bring a new disease? Will it multiply so rapidly that it overtakes native species? Will it fail to multiply and instead die, leaving the bay no better off?",
				"Previous outside studies have warned that perhaps more years of research are necessary before the oyster can be declared safe. But Maryland and Virginia have held the hope that the one-year study underway by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will be sufficient. When the results are released this summer, they will be forwarded to an independent committee for an evaluation that is expected to take six weeks, said Pete Jensen, an official with the Maryland Department of Natural Resources.

				"Teeming with raw sewage, animal waste and fertilizer runoff, yet responsible for half the Chesapeake Bay's fresh water, the Susquehanna River is the most endangered river in the United States, according to a report released this week by American Rivers, a national conservation group.",
				"Pennsylvania's massive Susquehanna, the bay's biggest tributary, tops a list of 10 American rivers with uncertain futures, including Ohio's Little Miami River, Tennessee's Roan Creek and South Carolina's Santee River. Most of them, said American Rivers President Rebecca R. Wodder, are befouled by raw sewage and urban and farm runoff -- problems made worse by population growth and cuts to federal cleanup money.",
				"The Susquehanna exemplifies ``the crisis we're highlighting in this report, that when it rains in America, raw sewage pours into our rivers and streams -- in an increasing amount,'' she said.",
				"Uphill and upstream from the bay, thousands of acres of Pennsylvania crop- and pastureland abut the banks of the Susquehanna or the creeks and streams that feed it. The farms are so small and far-flung that state environmental agencies struggle to bring all of them into compliance with laws governing pollutant runoff.",
				"The report also cites runoff from urban centers and the hundreds of sewer pipes that overflow in rainy weather, spewing human waste and garbage into the river.",
				"Fertilizer nutrients and filth from the Susquehanna is a chief cause of the algae blooms and pollution that suck oxygen from the Chesapeake Bay, decimating crab, oyster, fish and aquatic plant populations. A University of Maryland consultant has estimated that the river contributes 40 percent of the nitrogen and 20 percent of the phosphorus -- two key ingredients in fertilizers -- to the bay.",
				"``Pennsylvania is committed to reducing the nutrients and sediments that flow into our local streams and, in doing that, restoring the Chesapeake Bay,'' said Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection spokesman Charlie Young. ``But the federal government is talking about reducing the amount of (water cleanup money) that goes to Pennsylvania by almost $25 million'' next year, he said.",
				"Among state-funded cleanup efforts has been a $250 million bond issue last year to pay for sewage treatment plant upgrades, Young said. This year, Gov. Edward G. Rendell, D, is backing a proposal in the state legislature to issue another $800 million in bonds for water and sewage system improvements, to be voted on in coming days.",
				"Wodder said federal cuts to Pennsylvania's cleanup budget reflect the situation nationally. For example, she said, the Bush administration's proposed 2006 budget calls for cutting spending on the federal clean-water fund to $730 million, from $1.1 billion last year.",
				"``The feds are not contributing their fair share to solving the problem,'' she said.",
				"Benjamin Grumbles, assistant administrator for water at the Environmental Protection Agency, said the pared-back funding of $730 million in the president's budget request ``is part of a multi-year effort to commit $6.8 billion through 2011'' to the fund, which he said is intended to provide seed money to state-based loan programs to improve sewage treatment infrastructure.",
				"Overall, Grumbles said, the EPA favors more state-based water quality initiatives and ``innovative'' programs to combat pollution, such as pollution credits, which can be traded among top-polluting industries. "
