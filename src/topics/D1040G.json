                "Robert Blake's defense closed Wednesday without his testimony, gambling that jurors won't buy the state's largely circumstantial case that accuses the actor of shooting the wife he despised after he couldn't find someone willing to commit the crime.", 
                "M. Gerald Schwartzbach called 38 witnesses to emphasize the lack of evidence directly linking his client to the 2001 murder of Bonny Lee Bakley, and to attack the competence of the Los Angeles Police Department investigation, which focused early on the accused.", 
                "Schwartzbach has also closely followed a blueprint he laid out for jurors in his opening statement, but avoided a-trash-the-victim strategy by earlier counsel that dominated the early stages of the case with accounts of Bakley's involvement in a mail-order pornography business.", 
                "``For a celebrity case, it was tried like a pretty standard criminal case'' with the defense focusing on reasonable doubt, said Laurie Levenson, a former federal prosecutor who teaches criminal law at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles.", 
                "Levenson noted that Blake, 71, not only faces life if convicted of murder, but up to nine years if jurors find him guilty on the other charge, solicitation to murder.", 
                "``For Blake, there are a lot of ways to lose,'' said Levenson.", 
                "``At his age, it could be very close to a life sentence.", 
                "'' While Bakley hasn't emerged unscathed at trial, Schwartzbach suggested that someone from her past was out to harm her, and that Blake was concerned enough with the threat that he began to carry a gun for protection.", 
                "Prosecutors have built their case on the testimony of stuntmen Gary McLarty and Ronald ``Duffy'' Hambleton, who each testified Blake asked them to ``pop'' or ``snuff'' his wife, laying out multiple scenarios to kill her including one involving the restaurant near where she was killed May 4, 2001.", 
                "Blake has pleaded not guilty to killing Bakley.", 
                "He faces life in prison if he is convicted of murder.", 
                "The defense's strongest moment came during the cross examination of McLarty, when the veteran stuntman acknowledged a long-term cocaine addiction and a drug-induced breakdown in which he thought police were tunneling under his home and satellites monitoring his every move.", 
                "To a lesser degree, Schwartzbach tried to discredit Hambleton, who had testified that he hadn't used drugs since 1999, with witnesses who told jurors that the stuntman used drugs as late as 2001.", 
                "``Clearly, they didn't make the best witnesses,'' said Robert Pugsley, a criminal law professor at Southwestern School of Law in Los Angeles.", 
                "``On the other hand, that's all the prosecution had.", 
                "Even people on drugs can tell the truth.", 
                "'' Still, by keeping Blake off the witness stand, legal experts say jurors will remain focused on the credibility of those who did testify.", 
                "When a defendant testifies, ``It becomes `Do we believe the defendant?", 
                "' '' said Peter Keane, a former San Francisco public defender and criminal law professor at Golden Gate University School of Law in San Francisco.", 
                "But there is what Levenson called ``the Peterson effect.", 
                "'' Jurors want to hear from the defendant, she said.", 
                "They want to hear that side of the story.", 
                "Yet there's an obvious risk for any defendant who takes the stand.", 
                "``As a general rule in a criminal case, if you can keep your client from testifying, you do,'' Keane said.", 
                "And Blake's case has an added problem.", 
                "``It's a no-win situation,'' Levenson said, if he does well, ``prosecutors are just going to claim he is acting.", 
                "'' Despite excessive pretrial publicity about Bakley's tawdry past, legal experts said Schwartzbach was smart to avoid dirtying the victim.", 
                "``One of the things that turns jurors off is tarnishing the victim,'' Keane said.", 
                "'' Besides, experts say that Blake's earlier lawyers, most notably Harland Braun, excelled in their efforts to influence the jury pool by painting Bakley as a scam artist who bilked money out of men answering her ads in lonely hearts magazines.", 
                "Yet experts downplayed Schwartzbach's attempt to blame the police for allegedly mishandling evidence and focusing on Blake too early in the investigation Since the O.J.", 
                "Simpson double-murder trial, ``we have not had a case where the LAPD has not been accused of mishandling evidence,'' Pugsley said.", 
                "Its normal for police to focus immediately on a spouse of the murder victim.", 
                "``In most domestic partner killings, the surviving partner is the usual prime suspect, that doesn't mean Blake did it, but statistically he was the most likely suspect,'' he said."

                "The extended recess is needed because of jurors' medical appointments.", 
                "Blake, 71, is accused of shooting wife Bonny Lee Bakley, 44, to death in May 2001, as she sat in his car parked near a restaurant where they had dined.", 
                "Blake could face life in prison if convicted.", 
                "The prosecution wrapped up its case after calling a writer for the National Enquirer as its last rebuttal witness.", 
                "The testimony sought to shore up the account of Gary McLarty, one of two former stuntmen who said Blake solicited them to kill his wife.", 
                "The stuntmen were attacked by the defense as drug users who suffered from hallucinations and paranoia.", 
                "The Enquirer writer, Alan Smith, was called to vouch for the authenticity of an article he wrote quoting Cole McLarty, the son of the stuntman, about the case.", 
                "The prosecutor said that in the story Cole McLarty stated that Blake had talked of Bakley and \"he didn't like Bonny, didn't approve of her lifestyle and wanted her out of the way.", 
                "\" The story also said Gary McLarty told his son that \"he almost threw up when he heard Bonny Bakley was dead\" and he thought Blake was behind it.", 
                "Smith said all comments attributed to Cole McLarty about his father's contact with Blake regarding Bakley were correct.", 
                "Cole McLarty has denied saying many of the comments attributed to him in the story, for which he was paid $8,000.", 
                "The defense established on cross-examination of Smith that the story never said Blake asked Gary McLarty to kill Bakley.", 
                "Cole had testified for the defense, saying that when his father told him of his discussions with Blake it was about getting paid to beat up someone and there was no mention of killing Bakley.", 
                "The article itself was not admitted as evidence because it was considered hearsay, but prosecutors were allowed to raise it in an effort to contest Cole McLarty's testimony."

                "The prosecutor in the Robert Blake murder trial urged jurors Wednesday to ignore his celebrity, then derided his acting abilities by saying he overplayed his role as a grieving spouse.", 
                "Blake, a two-time Emmy Award winner, ``overestimated his acting abilities,'' said Deputy Los Angeles County District Attorney Shellie L. Samuels during her three-hour closing argument.", 
                "She told jurors that ``reality crashed into fantasy'' the moment Blake pulled the trigger, killing Bonny Lee Bakley on May 4, 2001, near a Studio City restaurant where the couple had just eaten.", 
                "And she said it explained why Blake became physically ill at the sight of his fatally injured wife.", 
                "``He shot people on TV.", 
                "He shot people in the movies.", 
                "But he never really shot a person in real life,'' Samuels said.", 
                "``It freaked him out.", 
                "'' Defense lawyer M. Gerald Schwartzbach countered that the evidence does not support the theory that Blake shot the 44-year-old Bakley.", 
                "``There is no direct evidence -- none, zero, zippo -- that Mr. Blake killed Bonny Bakley,'' he told jurors in a San Fernando Valley courtroom.", 
                "Schwartzbach accused the Los Angeles Police Department of incompetence, and rushing to judgment against the celebrity.", 
                "And he branded the key prosecution witnesses, both aging Hollywood stuntmen, as ``liars'' and delusional drug addicts.", 
                "Both testified that Blake tried to hire them to kill his wife.", 
                "The cornerstone of the circumstantial case was Blake's hatred for Bakley.", 
                "She had been convicted of fraud, ran a mail-order pornography business and, over his objections, bore his now 4-year-old daughter, Rosie.", 
                "Although Blake first tried to have Bakley undergo an abortion, his love for the girl grew after her birth, as did his hatred for the woman whom he felt he had been forced to marry, the prosecution contends.", 
                "``He was tricked by Bonny Lee and he hated her for it,'' Samuels said.", 
                "``He got taken by a small-time grifter.", 
                "'' No one witnessed the shooting and no fingerprints were found on the murder weapon, a Walther P-39 revolver later retrieved from a trash bin next to Blake's car, in which Bakley died, according to testimony.", 
                "The tiny amount of gunshot residue on Blake's hands could have come from handling the Smith &amp; Wesson revolver he was carrying at the time.", 
                "Blake, 71, is charged with murder, two counts of solicitation of murder.", 
                "If convicted he could be sentenced to life in prison.", 
                "The star of TV's ``Baretta'' said someone else shot his wife in his parked car when he returned to a Studio City restaurant to retrieve the Smith &amp; Wesson revolver that he said he accidentally left behind at their dinner table.", 
                "He told police he carried the gun because his wife feared she was being stalked.", 
                "But Samuels said no one saw Blake return to the restaurant.", 
                "``The alibi would have worked better if he truly had the acting abilities,'' she said, accusing him of acting more like a killer than a grieving spouse.", 
                "Samuels cited testimony that Blake tried to have Bakley arrested and her pregnancy aborted so that he would not have to marry her.", 
                "After their marriage in November 2000, Blake solicited two Hollywood stuntmen to kill her.", 
                "When he couldn't get anyone to go along with his murder-for-hire scheme, Samuels said the actor pulled the trigger himself.", 
                "Schwartzbach focused on the stuntmen -- Gary McLarty and Ronald ``Duffy'' Hambleton.", 
                "They admitted lying under oath about their drug use, and offered inconsistent versions of events, Schwartzbach said.", 
                "They also waited until Bakley was dead to tell police about Blake's murder schemes.", 
                "It was those troubled backgrounds, said Samuels, that made the stuntmen attractive to Blake.", 
                "``You are not going to go to your minister.", 
                "You are not going to go to your banker,'' she said.", 
                "``You are not going to go to anyone upstanding.", 
                "'' She said that despite their questionable lifestyles, their accounts were corroborated by pre-paid phone card records documenting 56 calls from Blake's house to Hambleton and three to McLarty.", 
                "She warned jurors to beware of ``red herrings'' put up by the defense, including McLarty's mental breakdown three years after Bakley's killing, Hambleton's earlier legal woes, the dearth of forensic evidence and a book author who shadowed homicide detectives during the investigation of Bakley's murder.", 
                "As early as the night of Bakley's murder, Blake ``did some suspicious things'' that led detectives at the scene to focus on him as a possible suspect, Samuels said.", 
                "She said a husband fearing for his wife's safety would not leave her sitting alone on a dark street.", 
                "And she also underscored the testimony of witnesses that the actor did not appear sincere when he cried over his wife's death, including one witness who described Blake as ``turning it on and off."

                "And while no one will mistake the San Fernando Valley courtroom -- where jurors are considering whether actor Robert Blake killed his wife -- for the Laugh Factory, both sides have exploited humor as a tool for making their cases.", 
                "Amid gruesome testimony on blood-spatter patterns and ballistics, defense attorney M. Gerald Schwartzbach and prosecutor Shellie L. Samuels have waxed comedic on a variety of subjects, including the pitfalls of modern marriage and musings on why some people claim they buy Playboy magazine only for the articles.", 
                "Moments of levity serve an important purpose within the staid confines of the courtroom by relieving tension, putting witnesses at ease and allowing lawyers to connect with a jury, according to attorneys and legal scholars.", 
                "``Humor is not going to change a case,'' said San Diego criminal defense attorney Charles Seville, co-author of two books on courtroom humor.", 
                "But if you can make the jury laugh, Seville said, ``you are going to be more persuasive.", 
                "'' Humor can also hammer home a point or deflect an opponent's argument.", 
                "Schwartzbach was sparring recently with an expert on crime scene reconstruction who had studied the trajectories of the bullets that struck and killed Blake's wife, Bonny Lee Bakley, in a parked car in Studio City four years ago.", 
                "It was important for Schwartzbach to undermine the testimony.", 
                "He wanted jurors to conclude that there was no reliable way the height of the killer could be deduced.", 
                "With the timing of a stand-up comic, Schwartzbach asked whether jurors could conclude that Bakley could have been shot by either ``Gary Coleman or Shaquille O'Neal.", 
                "'' The lawyers aren't the only courtroom cutups.", 
                "University of California, Los Angeles professor Ronald Siegel is an expert on the sustained use of hard-core drugs, which several key witnesses for the prosecution admitted using.", 
                "He drew laughs when he described some of the research upon which his credentials are based: tending a cage with crack-smoking monkeys in a basement on campus.", 
                "``I crawled into the cage with the monkeys and played monkey to make sure that the smoking tube was working,'' Siegel said.", 
                "``I didn't become a crazy monkey from any of that.", 
                "I do like bananas.", 
                "'' Even Blake, whose tears in and out of court have been the subject of much debate, laughed during a reference to his lack of home-decorating skills, and again when Schwartzbach described his purple-and-gold van as ``hideous.", 
                "'' In the Blake trial, each attorney has displayed a distinctive style of humor while vying for the hearts and minds of the jury.", 
                "Schwartzbach, soft-spoken and formal in ever-present bow ties, tends toward wry and self-deprecating one-liners.", 
                "``Stipulate to being married,'' the Mill Valley lawyer interjected when a witness testified she had ignored her husband at dinner at Vitello's, the Studio City restaurant where Bakley and Blake had dined immediately before Bakley was slain.", 
                "Samuels, a hard-nosed veteran prosecutor who has won 48 out of 49 murder cases, has been particularly caustic off-the-cuff.", 
                "As Schwartzbach was directing jurors to look at a blowup of a headline on the cover of a Playboy magazine, Samuels quipped that she was surprised the attorney hadn't focused on the super-sized image of the scantily clad woman.", 
                "At one point in the trial, which began in December, retired Hollywood stuntman Roy ``Snuffy'' Harrison, who said Blake had asked him to kill Bakley, was being pressed by Samuels on a bit of testimony that seemed to suffer from faulty memory.", 
                "She handed him a transcript of his earlier testimony and asked him to refer to it, as is common in criminal trials: Harrison: ``I fall on my head for 30 years, and you want me to read this?", 
                "'' Samuels: ``Whose choice was it to fall on his head for 30 years?",

                "``If you're ridiculing somebody, the jury generally doesn't like to see that,'' said Laurie Levenson, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles and a former federal prosecutor.",

                "Robert Blake's lawyer told jurors Thursday that they should discredit the testimony of two aging Hollywood stuntmen who say Blake asked them to kill his wife because they are drug addicts who have lied to authorities.", 
                "Each acknowledges he failed to tell police about Blake's alleged solicitations to kill his wife until Bonny Lee Bakley was fatally shot on May 4, 2001, near a restaurant where she and Blake had dinner, the lawyer said.", 
                "During his daylong summation of the two-month trial, M. Gerald Schwartzbach also disputed the accounts of several prosecution witnesses that Blake acted oddly the night his wife was killed, and denied that his client was acting when he wailed and moaned at the crime scene.", 
                "'' Both stuntmen changed their statements about the details of the solicitations, including the type and color of the gun Blake showed them, whether Blake offered money for a hit and possible locations to carry out the slaying.", 
                "He said it was a dumb murder plot -- to commit the crime in a place where Blake is well known, near his favorite restaurant.", 
                "``I'll kill her in a neighborhood I'm recognized in,'' Schwartzbach said sarcastically.", 
                "``How absurd would that have been?", 
                "'' Blake, 71, faces life in prison if convicted of killing Bakley.", 
                "He also is charged with soliciting the stuntmen to kill her, punishable by 9 years in prison.", 
                "The prosecution had argued earlier that Blake despised his wife, and when he could not get anyone else to kill her, he pulled he trigger himself.", 
                "In her summation Wednesday, Deputy Los Angeles County District Attorney Shellie L. Samuels told jurors that Blake, a two-time Emmy Award winner, ``overestimated his acting abilities.", 
                "'' She said the killing had ``freaked him out,'' causing him to become physically ill and unable to fulfill his plan to create an alibi by returning to the restaurant.", 
                "Not only did Blake have the opportunity to kill her, but he had motive, Samuels said, casting Bakley as a small-time scam artist who had tricked Blake -- who considered himself a streetwise tough guy -- into marriage by getting pregnant.", 
                "She said Blake fell in love with their now-4-year-old daughter, Rosie, and began scheming to gain sole custody of the child while trying to get rid of Bakley.", 
                "Schwartzbach reminded jurors that Gary McLarty testified that Blake never directly asked to kill his wife.", 
                "He said the stuntman assumed what Blake wanted, and was wrong, the result of a ``very disturbed dysfunctional mind'' because of long-term drug use.", 
                "``He (McLarty) testified he was unclear in his mind what Mr. Blake was talking about,'' Schwartzbach said of McLarty who testified about a drug induced breakdown when he hallucinated that police were tunneling under his home and satellites were watching him from the skies.", 
                "``I'm sure a lot of things where unclear in Mr. McLarty's mind, using cocaine for 20 to 30 years,'' Schwartzbach said.", 
                "Schwartzbach downplayed records from a prepaid phone card and a restaurant where Blake and Ronald ``Duffy'' Hambleton ate, saying they do not confirm the substance of their conversations, only that they took place.", 
                "``What does that prove?", 
                "Where's the corroboration that they were solicited to commit murder?", 
                "The lawyer also ridiculed the idea that Blake would ask these aging stuntmen -- one who had recently had a heart attack and they other missing a kidney -- to kill Bakley.", 
                "Schwartzbach also took aim at another key prosecution witness: hoodlum-turned-preacher Frank Minucci, who testified that Blake wanted his wife dead.", 
                "Minucci took money from the National Enquirer and testified for publicity, Schwartzbach said."

                "He also pointed out that the weapon used to kill Bonny Lee Bakley was a 60-year-old handgun that contained only three rounds of obsolete ammunition.", 
                "Only two of the bullets were used, and Bakley was still breathing when paramedics arrived.", 
                "Schwartzbach said Blake wouldn't create such an elaborate plot, then leave his wife alive to possibly identify him.",

                "Schwartzbach was expected to conclude his closing arguments Friday, with jurors expected to get the case after prosecutors have a chance to rebut defense arguments.", 
                "Prosecutor Shellie Samuels said in her closing arguments Wednesday that Blake killed Bakley because she was a con artist who tricked him into marrying her by getting pregnant and giving birth to a daughter he quickly became obsessed with protecting from Bakley.", 
                "Schwartzbach argued Thursday that Blake had been willing to put up with Bakley for the sake of their daughter.", 
                "\"He'd come to terms with the fact that it was family,\" the lawyer said.", 
                "Schwartzbach said Blake's cries and moans the night his wife was killed were genuine, and dismissed as mistaken witnesses who suggested the actor was faking grief.", 
                "He reminded jurors that a firefighter captain, police officer and nurse had testified that Blake was sobbing, moaning and vomiting after the attack, and that paramedics had asked that he be kept away so they could aid Bakley.", 
                "Blake \"is a man of emotions,\" Schwartzbach said.", 
                "Schwartzbach also attacked the credibility of the prosecution's two key witnesses.",

                "He told detectives he was armed because his wife feared someone was stalking her.", 
                "Prosecutors argued that Blake's account didn't add up because nobody saw him retrieve the gun from the restaurant, but Schwartzbach said the layout of the restaurant would have made it easy for Blake to slip in, retrieve the gun and leave.", 
                "Blake's .38-caliber revolver was not the gun used to kill Bakley.", 
                "The murder weapon was found in a nearby trash bin."
