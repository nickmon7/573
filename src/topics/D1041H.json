                "Discarded utility poles were submerged in waters off Nanliao Port in the northern Taiwan county of Hsinchu Friday to create artificial reefs as part of the government's fishery resources conservation efforts.", 
                "The reefs were constructed under a long-term cooperative program between the Council of Agriculture's (COA's) Fishery Administration and state-owned Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower).", 
                "Over the past three decades, Taiwan has created a large number of artificial reefs made from discarded utility poles, decommissioned naval vessels and discarded tires at 100-plus designated areas along the coastline to enhance fishery resources.", 
                "COA officials said the artificial reefs not only function to prevent the deterioration of fishing grounds but also help increase fish stocks.", 
                "\"The structures provide a foundation that is colonized by coral polyps and in time becomes thickly encrusted with living coral, providing an ecosystem in which marine life can thrive, \" a COA official said.", 
                "With underground electrical wiring becoming a general trend in recent years, Taipower has donated many waste cement utility poles for the creation of more than 10,000 artificial reefs in 79 coastal regions, including Taoyuan County's Yungan, Hsinchun County's Nanliao, Taichung County's Wuchi, Changhua County's Wangkung and Hualien County's Yenliao, for conservation of fishery resources and other marine life.", 
                "In addition to enhancing fishery resources, the artificial reef areas have also become points of interest and create new businesses in such areas as deep-sea diving, leisure fishing and recreational scuba diving."

                "Wreckage of the Amorgos, a Greek freighter that ran aground and sank off the coast of Kenting at the southernmost tip of Taiwan Jan. 14, 2001, is now \"a slaughter hell\" for coral in an area of Lungkeng off Kenting, said Cheng Ming-hsiu, Society chairman and a researcher with Academia Sinica's Institute of Zoology.", 
                "Since the freighter's sinking, its wreckage has continued to impair the growth of coral because of the sharp metal edges of the wreck, turning the area into a coral graveyard, Cheng claimed.", 
                "He added that after a series of observations, it has been found that in a 2 km by 500 meter coral reef area near Lungkeng, Kenting, coral coverage rate has continued to drop.", 
                "Contrary to previous speculation that the freighter's wreckage could become an undersea artificial fishery reef, he said, the ship has disintegrated in the strong currents and its debris has continued to spread, posing increasing threats to the coral.", 
                "The harmful debris will not disappear by itself and it cannot be \"digested\" by the sea, Cheng argued, adding that the only option is to have it removed before more coral, the ecological system and Taiwan's tourism resources are further compromised.", 
                "A similar situation has been found in an undersea area to the east of Green Island, where the freighter Picasso sank 12 years ago, Cheng said.", 
                "By comparison, he said, coral reefs near Penghu Island are found to be the most healthy, with coral coverage rate totaling nearly 100 percent.", 
                "The Amorgos, carrying 60,000 tons of iron ore, was heading for Nantong in mainland China from Singapore when it developed mechanical problems and began to drift.",

                "All 25 crew members were rescued, but the ship later broke in two and an estimated 1,150 tons of fuel oil gushed out of the vessel and blanketed coral reefs in the Oluanpi area.", 
                "The oil spill has blanketed coral reefs in the Oluanpi area, causing an ecological disaster that will take the sensitive ecosystem years from which to recover.",

                "IUCN on Friday launched a report named \"2004 Status of Coral Reefs of the World\" at the 3rd World Conservation Conference, which is being held in Bangkok from Nov. 17 to Nov. 25.", 
                "The report warned that the destruction of reefs would have a major impact on the lives of more than one billion people.", 
                "\"Reefs provide seafood for one billion people in Asia alone, many of them from poor communities.", 
                "Reef-based activities, principally fishing and tourism, provide economic livelihoods for millions of others,\" said the IUCN press release.", 
                "Besides human impact, coral reefs are also threatened by global weather change.", 
                "In 1998, an El Nino global coral bleaching event caused deaths of many coral reefs, a disaster occurring only once in 1,000 years.", 
                "However, \"the extreme events of 1998 will become more common in the next 50 years,\" with increasing sea surface temperatures and other factors.", 
                "\"Massive global bleaching mortality will not be a 1/1000 year event in the future, but a regular event,\" warned the release.", 
                "It noted that coral on many Caribbean reefs have declined by up to 80 percent, and many reefs do not resemble the reefs of 30 years ago.", 
                "In south Asia, over 60 percent of the reefs were killed during the 1998 mass bleaching, and today almost half of the reefs remain dead.", 
                "Even in the higher diversity areas of Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean, there are few encouraging signs for reefs for increasing human pressures.", 
                "At the beginning of its one-week meeting in Bangkok, IUCN declared a red list of more than 15,000 species facing extinction if no effective conservation measures are taken."

                "After global warming _ blamed for higher water temperatures and carbon dioxide concentrations _ threats to the reefs include coral disease, overfishing, coastal development and pollution runoff from land-based sources.",

                "The administration's efforts so far to protect coral reefs include improving monitoring and satellite surveillance, agreeing to Geneva-based treaty restrictions on international trade in coral reefs and passing out $10 million (euro7.4 million) in grants, Lautenbacher said.", 
                "The administration is also considering creating a national marine sanctuary and banning commercial fishing in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands to protect the chain's delicate reefs.", 
                "A decision is expected by the end of 2005, Lautenbacher said.",

                "'' These are only some of the conclusions of an exhaustive new report by 240 scientists in 98 countries, working under the auspices of the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network.", 
                "Coral reefs, in addition to being breathtakingly beautiful, are among the cradles of life on Earth -- hotbeds of biodiversity critical to sustaining oceanic health.", 
                "But a combination of global warming, pollution, overfishing, diseases and other factors is ravaging reefs worldwide.", 
                "While Australian and Pacific reefs remain relatively healthy, the report documents devastating declines elsewhere, including the Caribbean region, where coral cover on many reefs has declined by up to 80 percent.", 
                "If something isn't done soon, it will be too late for many reefs to recover.", 
                "The dire threat to the world's -- and America's -- oceans is hardly a surprise, and it isn't limited to coral reefs either.", 
                "Two major task forces have recently documented the grave ecological conditions of America's coastal waters.", 
                "The studies basically show the same thing: People are using the oceans in a fashion that can't be sustained, and, absent serious change across a range of human behaviors, the oceans will die off.", 
                "Yet despite the widespread agreement on the nature and severity of the problem, action has been slow.", 
                "Along with the related issue of climate change, this is the preeminent environmental issue of our time.", 
                "President Bush should make it a priority of his second term.", 
                "An opportunity to begin doing so is coming; the administration by law has to respond by Dec. 20 to the recommendations of the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy, which Congress created in 2000 to examine America's policy toward its coastal waters.", 
                "So far, there is no indication the administration is contemplating the needed dramatic shifts in policy.",

                "For some time, scientists have predicted that the world's coral reefs will be among the first ecosystems to suffer devastating damage from global warming.", 
                "Some reefs, however, are proving surprisingly resilient, researchers say, not because of qualities of the corals, but because of heat-tolerant algae that live with them.", 
                "It may even be possible that heat-related episodes of coral bleaching, which had been viewed as ominous previews of mass coral death to come, could allow these robust algae to spread, leaving corals better able to survive in a warmer world.", 
                "The scientists say this strength in the face of warming will not be enough to save the world's coral reefs, which are threatened by pollution, overfishing, tourism and other human activities.", 
                "But if the findings hold up, \"they essentially buy us time\" to address those issues, said Andrew C. Baker of the Marine Program of the Wildlife Conservation Society, who led the new work.", 
                "Algae and corals live in a symbiotic relationship.", 
                "Coral polyps absorb and shelter the algae, and as the algae photosynthesize they produce sugars that the corals use for energy.", 
                "But this relationship can falter when ocean water warms, Baker said.", 
                "\"Basically, algae cells are lost from the coral host,\" he said.", 
                "\"We don't know if it's the algae leaving a sick coral colony or a coral ejecting a defunct algae.", 
                "I suspect it's a bit of both.", 
                "\" The result is coral bereft of much of its power supply.", 
                "The living polyps that give coral reefs their color wither, usually leaving lifeless white skeleton reefs of calcium carbonate.", 
                "It is as if the reefs have been bleached.", 
                "But the new research, led by Baker, suggests that heat-tolerant algae may move in to replace strains lost in bleaching events.", 
                "If so, he said, \"some of the doom and gloom might not be as bad as had been suggested.", 
                "\" The findings are \"definitely good news,\" said Nancy Knowlton, an expert on corals who directs the Center for Marine Biodiversity and Conservation of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego.", 
                "Baker and his colleagues studied corals affected by El Nino-Southern Oscillation events, natural disruptions of ocean currents that occur periodically and that can cause ocean temperatures to rise in one area or another.", 
                "In particular, they studied what happened to corals in relatively shallow waters off the Pacific coast of Panama, and in the Indian Ocean off Kenya and Mauritius.", 
                "All the corals they studied were colonized by Symbiodinium algae, a diverse genus whose various species look alike but react differently to heat.", 
                "Using DNA analysis, they compared the algae populations at those three sites with algae strains in coral reefs in the Persian Gulf, which are relatively tolerant of heat, and with other corals in the Red Sea, where temperatures do not normally rise as high and where algae strains are less heat-tolerant.", 
                "The scientists found that reefs in Panama and Kenya, which had experienced unusually high water temperatures, had high proportions of a heat-tolerant strain called symbiont D. By contrast, reefs off Mauritius, where waters remained cooler, had fewer symbiont D algae.", 
                "They resembled the reefs of the Red Sea, Baker said.", 
                "Baker said these findings, reported in the journal Nature in August, suggested that when corals lost algae in a bleaching event, heat-tolerant algae could move in to replace them.", 
                "Symbiont D \"is becoming more common on reefs that are experiencing bleaching events,\" Baker said.", 
                "He said the findings were the first \"real-world evidence\" that corals might adapt to warming.", 
                "But this kind of adaptation may not be enough \"to let corals off the hook,\" as Knowlton of the Scripps Institution put it in an interview.", 
                "For example, according to a report issued this month by the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network, scientists do not know exactly what conditions must exist for corals to acquire new strains of algae.", 
                "They do not even know if changes occur when corals recruit different algae from the water around them, or if something somehow changes the ratio of algae strains growing within them.", 
                "Also, Knowlton said, it is not yet known whether corals colonized with new varieties of algae will grow as well as they once did with other strains.", 
                "For example, she said, it could be that heat-tolerant algae strains devote more of their energy to reproducing and less to providing sustenance to their coral hosts.", 
                "And though symbiont D is widespread among the world's corals, Knowlton said, scientists do not know whether all of them can support the strain.", 
                "Answers to those questions await more research, and she said the study of corals was still developing.", 
                "\"If it were birds it would be 18th- or 19th-century science -- who's living with whom, where,\" she said.", 
                "History suggests that the coral bleaching and mortality associated with the severe El Nino phenomenon of 1997-98 was a thousand-year event, according to the monitoring network's coral report.", 
                "That means, in theory, that there is only a 1-in-1,000 chance that similar effects would be seen in a given year.", 
                "But, the report says, evidence strongly suggests that global warming will turn severe bleaching into \"a regular event\" by the middle of the century.", 
                "So evidence of coral recovery since 1998 is encouraging, the report says.", 
                "\"Some people would argue that global climate change is their biggest long-term threat,\" Knowlton said, \"and it's the one we have the least ability to do anything about.", 
                "So good news on the global warming front is very welcome.", 
                "\" About half the reefs that were left badly damaged after the 1997-98 El Nino event have bounced back, Baker said.", 
                "\"So even from a major event there can be recovery,\" he said, if overfishing, habitat destruction and other threats are mitigated.", 
                "\"But there can't be recovery if we triple- and quadruple-whammy these reefs."

                "Researchers at Florida's Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution have discovered that this year's rash of hurricanes scoured damaging seaweed, known scientifically as macroalgae, from coral reefs off the Florida coast, though they warned it is likely to come back.", 
                "Farther south, scientists found that serious concentrations of a blue-green algae known as cyanobacterium are killing corals and other reef organisms.", 
                "``This is uncharted territory,'' said Harbor Branch marine ecologist Brian Lapointe.", 
                "``No one has ever had the chance to study the impacts of natural phenomena like hurricanes on reefs under siege from these harmful algae blooms that we believe are triggered by humans.", 
                "'' Before the hurricanes struck, the scientists, funded by the Environmental Protection Agency and the state of Florida, began examining reefs stretching about 130 miles from Fort Pierce to north of Miami.", 
                "The scientists were looking for evidence that the algae blooms are caused by human-generated runoff in the waterways, including sewage and agricultural waste.", 
                "The group suspended its activity for two months while hurricanes Frances and Jeanne pounded the region; when they returned, they found that reefs in northern Palm Beach County had been scoured clean of macroalgae such as seaweed.", 
                "But the hurricanes did not end the problem.", 
                "``This is a break, not a solution for the reefs,'' Lapointe said.", 
                "``Unless we can get a clear understanding of what drives these blooms and control the culprits, it's going to be more of the same, and we'll risk losing this incredible ecological and economic resource."

                "The United Nations Thursday set aside $1 million to assess environmental damage caused by this week's devastating tsunami, as reports of destroyed coral reefs and uprooted mangrove forests began trickling in.", 
                "While attention is clearly focused on the rising human toll of the tragedy, some dive operators and marine biologists are reporting that from Sri Lanka to Thailand corals are suffocating under layers of mud, heaps of rotten fish, are clogging beachfronts, and rare turtle nesting sites have been washed out to sea.", 
                "\"There is a huge natural cost, but what it is is still to be determined,\" said Lynne Hale, director of the global marine initiative for the Nature Conservancy, who worked in Thailand's Phuket Island and Sri Lanka for many years.", 
                "Both areas were hard hit by the tsunami.", 
                "Now based in Rhode Island, Hale said the tsunami may have caused lasting environmental damage that may take decades or longer to recover from.", 
                "\"This is a massive, massive erosion event,\" she said.", 
                "A UN task force based in Geneva will assess two things: environmental damage that threatens human health, and the toll on the ecological resources -- many of which support tourism and the fishing industry.", 
                "The Indian Ocean region, with its aqua, shallow seas, hosts some of the most beloved and famous coral reefs in the world that support scores of fish species found nowhere else.", 
                "Mangroves are critical nurseries for many of these fish.", 
                "And the beaches of Sri Lanka, the Andaman and Nicobar islands, and other countries hit by the tsunami host prime nesting spots for some of the world's rarest sea turtles, such as leatherbacks that return to the same spot year after year to lay eggs.", 
                "Scientists Thursday said they expect marine life from shore to about a mile out to have suffered the worst damage.", 
                "However, some biologists speculated that marine mammals such as whales and dolphins swimming near shore when the tsunami struck may have sensed the strange seas and headed for deeper waters, where the giant waves were barely noticeable.", 
                "Land animals may have had the same \"sixth sense\" to move to safety: Wildlife officials in Sri Lanka's Yala National Park said they have not seen evidence that many animals died, despite the preserve's closeness to the ocean.", 
                "Scientists don't have comprehensive historical data about marine damage that tsunamis can cause, especially one of this magnitude.", 
                "They do know that in 1883, when the Krakatoa volcano exploded and sent a giant tsunami washing over Indonesia, coral heads that weighed hundreds of tons were tossed hundreds of feet inland.", 
                "And in 1964, when a tsunami hit Alaska, news reports noted that baby salmon were killed, although it's unclear how many.", 
                "This week, dive operators and researchers began sending e-mails to the WorldFish Center in Malaysia, an international fisheries research center, painting an early bleak picture of the region's treasured coastal waters.", 
                "On Phuket Island, one popular beach was piled with dead staghorn coral, starfish, gulper eels, sea cucumbers, and sea grasses.", 
                "In the Maldives, dive operator Norbert Schmidt said the eastern part of the island was hit the worst, with dead coral and sand covering the runway at Hulule International Airport.", 
                "In Sri Lanka and Thailand, coral damage is reported to be severe, and trees have crashed down onto reefs, ripping many of the corals, some hundreds of years old, apart.", 
                "\"Many fish washed ashore, trees that were knocked down (smashed) into the reefs,\" Michiru Main, a researcher who was conducting a reef survey at Mu Ko Surin, a popular dive spot in Thailand, when the tsunami struck, said in an e-mail.", 
                "\"I can definitely say there is damage in the area.", 
                "\" Already stressed from fishing and tourism, many of the reefs may be covered in mud, which can block sunlight that fish and other organisms below them need.", 
                "Meanwhile, corals, which only grow a fraction of an inch each year, may be excreting mucus as a defensive mechanism against the mud -- \"expensive in terms of energy (that) weakens the coral,\" e-mailed Marco Noordeloos of the WorldFish Center.", 
                "Noordeloos said fish populations have probably been damaged, too, although it's far too early to get a complete picture.", 
                "Some scientists this week said human activity in the coastal zone contributed to the immense damage on shore -- such as building tourist hotels too close to the water and tearing out mangrove forests to put in shrimp aquaculture farms throughout Asia.", 
                "But others say that while the lack of mangrove forests probably exacerbated the destruction, it's unlikely that they would have slowed the tsunami's enormous volume of water.", 
                "\"Maybe in East Africa where the waves weren't as high, but I'm not sure when you get a 40-foot wave a mangrove would have made a huge difference,\" said Susi Moser, research scientist for the National Center for Atmospheric Research.",

                "Beaches around South Asia devastated by tsunamis could be restored to their former glory within a few years, but the marine life through which the huge waves passed could take centuries to recover, experts said.", 
                "Coral reefs, mangroves, fish and other marine life had been damaged by the tsunamis which rose out of the Indian Ocean on Sunday, triggered by a massive earthquake near the Indonesian island of Sumatra.", 
                "The disaster has left more than 120,000 people dead and up to five million displaced in the region, with Indonesia, Thailand, India and Sri Lanka the worst affected countries.", 
                "\"It is so hard to say in brief, but the level of devastation of coastal areas by the disaster is obvious,\" director of Conservation International in the Indonesian resort island of Bali, Ketut Sarjana Putra, said.", 
                "\"It will take a long time to recover.", 
                "\" The ocean's seagrass bed and mangrove ecosystem would also be affected, Putra said, but it is the reefs that bore the brunt of the destruction.",

                "It will take hundreds of years to grow back,\" he said.",

                "Lyle Vail, director of the Lizard Island Research Station on Australia's Great Barrier Reef, said damage to coral reefs from a tsunami would likely be similar to that from a cyclone.", 
                "When a tsunami passes, reef structures grind into each other causing extensive damage.", 
                "In serious cases recovery would be slow as there would be fewer larval animals to repopulate the coral.", 
                "A major problem would be a loss of fish, displaced by the waves from their habitat, and other forms of protein which depend on the reefs.", 
                "Regional marine programme co-ordinator for South and Southeast Asia with the IUCN (World Conservation Union) in Colombo, Sri Lanka, Jerker Tamelander, said damage to the marine ecosystem could be \"very, very serious.", 
                "\" \"You have a region where the marine ecosystem is stressed and degraded as it is,\" he told AFP.", 
                "Tamelander said many coral reefs in the Indian Ocean were just beginning to recover from damage caused by the changing water temperatures generated by the El Nino weather pattern.", 
                "\"In the region as a whole I think we can expect very severe ecosystem effects,\" he said, adding the recovery process for coral reefs could take \"decades to centuries\".", 
                "A major problem would be the amount of silt, sand and organic matter churned into the water which would then \"smother\" vegetation and marine life.", 
                "Coral could also have been damaged by exposure to the air as water was sucked back from the shore before the tsunamis hit.", 
                "Tamelander says in some cases mangroves, which protect the shore from erosion and often serve as nurseries for young fish, would also have been completel0 years,\" he said."
