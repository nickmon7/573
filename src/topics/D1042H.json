                "The case now will begin a sentencing hearing in which a military jury will determine what punishment England, 22, should face.", 
                "Before accepting England's plea, Pohl carefully scrutinized the charges and the actions of the 22-year-old Army reservist.", 
                "He asked England what happened in the facility outside Baghdad that caused the infamous scene of the prisoner being led by a leash.", 
                "England responded that the man was refusing to cooperate with the guards and that her supervisor, Spec.", 
                "Charles A. Graner Jr., told her to go get the strap and put it around the prisoner as a leash.", 
                "He also instructed her to hold the prisoner because Graner said it would be more degrading to the man.", 
                "Then Pohl asked England what training she had for prison work.", 
                "England, who was a records clerk in the military before being assigned to Abu Ghraib, said she had none and told the judge she was unaware of the Geneva Conventions.", 
                "But she said that Graner had worked as a civilian as a prison guard and she trusted his analysis of the situation.", 
                "Pohl then said, ``I don't see how it would be illegal to pose for a photograph if you considered it legal.", 
                "'' But after a recess, he accepted the plea deal.", 
                "England, from Fort Ashby, W. Va., originally faced nine charges, but the Army agreed to drop two of those as part of the agreement.", 
                "She pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy, four counts of maltreating prisoners and one count of dereliction of duty.", 
                "Her defense lawyers said the deal was expected to reduce the maximum sentence she faced from 16 1/2 years in prison to 11.", 
                "She is the seventh enlisted soldier to face criminal penalties in the Abu Ghraib case.", 
                "No commissioned officers at the prison, and no senior officer in the chain of command, has been charged.", 
                "Six enlisted soldiers have entered guilty pleas in the case.", 
                "Graner, who reportedly fathered a child with England during their service in Iraq, faced a court-martial in January.", 
                "He was convicted and sentenced to 10 years in prison despite his assertion that senior officers directed and approved the actions of guards in cellblock One-Alpha."

                "Lynndie R. England, the young Army reservist whose grinning, thumbs-up image came to symbolize the worst of the Abu Ghraib prison scandal, told a military judge Monday that she knew the detainee abuses were wrong but went along because of peer pressure.", 
                "Offering the most ordinary explanation to a scandal that ignited international outrage, England said she posed in some of the widely circulated photographs showing humiliating abuses of Iraqi detainees to placate her then-boyfriend and others from her Maryland-based unit.", 
                "``I had a choice, but I chose to do what my friends wanted me to,'' England, 22, said in a glum voice as she pleaded guilty to mistreating detainees at the notorious Baghdad prison.", 
                "``They were being very persistent and bugging me, and I was like, OK, whatever.", 
                "'' England became one of the most visible and polarizing figures in the prison abuse scandal when the notorious photographs of naked and hooded Iraqi detainees enduring abuses at the hands of U.S. soldiers became public a year ago.", 
                "The 5-foot, 1-inch soldier with the pixie haircut was shown flashing a thumbs-up behind a pyramid of naked prisoners in one photograph.", 
                "In another, she has a cigarette clenched in her teeth as she grins and points at the genitals of a naked detainee.", 
                "In one of the most vivid pictures from the scandal, England is shown holding a leather leash tied around the neck of a prisoner lying on the cellblock floor.", 
                "Those photographs stood in stark contrast to the image of England when she returned to the United States early last year, pregnant (reportedly by the scandal's reputed ringleader, Charles Graner) and facing more than three decades in a military prison for her role in the abuses.", 
                "Closing the last high-profile case in the scandal, England pleaded guilty Monday to two counts of conspiracy, four counts of mistreating detainees and one count of dereliction of duty.", 
                "England, who gave birth to a son in October, now faces a maximum sentence of 11 years in military prison.", 
                "But she is expected to face considerably less time than that under the undisclosed terms of her plea deal with prosecutors.", 
                "A jury composed of Army officers and enlisted soldiers will be seated Tuesday morning to recommend a sentence for England as part of a penalty hearing expected to last several days.", 
                "Under military law, she would receive the lesser punishment between what the jury recommends and what prosecutors have offered.", 
                "England was one of seven members of the 372nd Military Police Company charged with humiliating and assaulting prisoners at Abu Ghraib.", 
                "Four other members of the 372nd and two low-level military intelligence officers have entered guilty pleas in the abuse scandal and received sentences ranging from no time to 8 1/2 years.", 
                "Sabrina Harman, a former Abu Ghraib guard, is scheduled to go to trial at Fort Hood next week.", 
                "Graner is so far the only soldier charged in the scandal to contest the case against him at a military trial.", 
                "He was convicted of every charge at a trial here in January and sentenced to 10 years in prison.", 
                "Monday, Graner was back at the court building at Fort Hood, called as a possible witness for England in the penalty phase of her proceedings.", 
                "England's attorneys are expected to argue as part of their mitigating case that England was led astray by Graner, whom she frequently sneaked out at night to visit at the prison's cellblock.", 
                "The two no longer are romantically involved.", 
                "After his conviction, Graner married fellow soldier and former co-defendant Megan Ambuhl; he is serving his sentence at the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kan.", 
                "Under questioning Monday from Col. James L. Pohl, a military judge, England repeatedly said that she agreed at Graner's suggestion to appear in the photographs that outraged much of the Arab world and opened an embarrassing chapter in the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.", 
                "When Pohl asked about the photograph showing England holding a detainee by a leash, she said it was Graner's idea: ``I assumed it was OK, because he was an MP.", 
                "He had the background as a corrections officer, and, him being older than me, I thought he knew what he was doing.", 
                "'' England said she knew it was wrong when Graner pulled out his digital camera and started taking pictures of the episode ``for his own amusement.", 
                "'' Defense attorneys are expected to present evidence over the next few days that England has long suffered from mental problems and learning disabilities and was extremely susceptible to the influence of her peers.", 
                "In court, England frequently appeared hesitant and unsure of her answers as Pohl asked whether she knew other various actions were wrong at the time she committed them -- a key legal test in determining whether a plea in military court can be accepted.", 
                "The judge spent nearly three hours going over with England the details of an 11-page statement of facts that England acknowledged in her plea deal.", 
                "``If you knew it was wrong, then why did you do it?", 
                "'' Pohl asked again and again during the hearing.", 
                "Referring to Graner, England repeatedly answered: ``He asked me to.", 
                "'' ``Did you get any amusement out of it?", 
                "'' Pohl asked at one point.", 
                "``Not really,'' England said after a long pause.", 
                "``But I did what they wanted me to."

                "While government officials initially tried to minimize the Abu Ghraib abuses as being at the hands of a few bad apples in the Army Reserve, the larger investigations revealed widespread abuses involving questionable and harsh interrogation tactics.", 
                "England's defense team has been arguing for nearly a year that her case was part of a bigger picture, initially trying to get top U.S. officials, including Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, to testify at her court martial about the nation's policies for handling and interrogating detainees.",

                "Of the seven members of the 372nd Military Police Company charged in the abuse scandal, four have previously entered guilty pleas, and the only soldier to stand trial so far was Charles Graner, who was serving a 10-year jail term."

                "Charles Graner, who orchestrated many of the abuses and will be called as a witness for England.", 
                "She and Graner, both from the Maryland-based 372nd Military Police Company, were romantically involved while in Iraq.", 
                "England gave birth to his son in October, months after they broke up.", 
                "Last month, the imprisoned Graner was married by proxy to co-defendant Megan Ambuhl.", 
                "Graner is crucial to England's claim that she followed his lead at Abu Ghraib, where he was a guard and she was a clerk.", 
                "Before accepting her guilty pleas, the judge, Col. James Pohl, required England to clearly describe her wrongdoing and motives.", 
                "Asked if she had been ordered by her chain of command to mistreat inmates, England replied, \"No, sir.", 
                "\" Queried how she knew it was wrong to pose in a photo with nude inmates being forced to masturbate, England said: \"Anybody could be offended seeing that picture.", 
                "\" The interrogation produced repeated statements by England that soldiers abused Iraqis \"for their own amusement,\" and admissions that she participated \"because they asked me to.", 
                "\" But she also confirmed to the judge's satisfaction that she knew it was wrong to engage in the abuses, regardless of the fact that Graner and another abusive soldier had backgrounds as civilian prison guards.", 
                "Explaining perhaps the most notorious photo in which she appeared, England said the main reason she held an Iraqi on a leash was because Graner told her to.", 
                "Graner had said he wanted to photograph the 5-foot-1 England controlling the nude Iraqi to instill fear in other inmates, she claimed.", 
                "\"He wanted it to look more degrading and humiliating, with a female of my size,\" she said.", 
                "But she quickly realized Graner's explanation that he needed to abuse the detainees in order to \"control\" them was not true.", 
                "\"I thought it was not only morally wrong but legally wrong,\" she said.", 
                "England also conceded that during most of her misdeeds, she was visiting Graner and other friends from her company, but wasn't always on official business in the maximum security wing where they worked.", 
                "England also backed off from earlier assertions that the tormenting of detainees was part of an effort to soften them up for intelligence agents.", 
                "Although guards were told to deprive detainees of sleep, manipulate their meal schedules and force them to maintain awkward positions to cause stress, England said, \"no, sir,\" when asked if any of her crimes were done to help interrogators.", 
                "Officers and enlisted soldiers who will set England's punishment are expected to hear testimony from several defense witnesses, including psychology and sociology experts, as well as Graner.", 
                "In a sentencing hearing likely to last several days, jurors also could hear a prosecution witness who is expected to describe England's job performance while in Iraq, which included admonishments for her affair with Graner."

                "The 22-year-old private, who featured in some of the most graphic pictures of sexual humiliation of prisoners at the jail near Baghdad, told the hearing she had been following the orders of her former boyfriend, Specialist Charles Graner, one of the abuse ringleaders.", 
                "\"I assumed it was okay because he was an MP and he had the background of being a corrections officer,\" said England, who pled guilty to seven charges relating to the abuse of prisoners in October and November 2003.", 
                "The military judge, Colonel James Pohl, halted proceedings after England indicated that she did not believe her actions were wrong.",

                "\" The prisoner then crawled out of the cell with England holding the strap.",

                "England reached a plea bargain with military prosecutors, who dropped a dereliction of duty charge and one of committing an indecent act when she was photographed performing fellatio on another solider.", 
                "That brings the maximum sentence she risks down to 11 years from the original 16-and-a-half years.", 
                "Her defense asked the judge to roll several maltreatment charges into one, which would bring the maximum sentence down to eight years.",

                "She was also photographed engaging in fellatio with Graner, the father of her newborn baby, who is serving a 10-year jail term for beating and sexually humiliating prisoners.",
