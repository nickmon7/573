                "Offering the most ordinary explanation to a scandal that ignited international outrage, England said she posed in some of the widely circulated photographs showing humiliating abuses of Iraqi detainees to placate her then-boyfriend and others from her Maryland-based unit.", 
                "``I had a choice, but I chose to do what my friends wanted me to,'' England, 22, said in a glum voice as she pleaded guilty to mistreating detainees at the notorious Baghdad prison.",

                "In court, England frequently appeared hesitant and unsure of her answers as Pohl asked whether she knew other various actions were wrong at the time she committed them -- a key legal test in determining whether a plea in military court can be accepted.", 
                "The judge spent nearly three hours going over with England the details of an 11-page statement of facts that England acknowledged in her plea deal.", 
                "``If you knew it was wrong, then why did you do it?", 
                "'' Pohl asked again and again during the hearing.",

                "Under a deal she made with military prosecutors, the reservist from Fort Ashby, W.Va., will serve less than the maximum term of 11 years in prison that could result from her guilty plea.", 
                "She had faced nine counts and could have received up to 16 1/2 years.", 
                "A military jury here will decide her sentence this week.", 
                "England, 22, was perhaps the most familiar face in the notorious photos.", 
                "She was pictured holding one inmate tethered to a leash.",

                "'' The emergence of the Abu Ghraib photographs spawned nearly a dozen defense department and military inquiries into detainee abuse and focused an international spotlight on U.S. detention operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.", 
                "While government officials initially tried to minimize the Abu Ghraib abuses as being at the hands of a few bad apples in the Army Reserve, the larger investigations revealed widespread abuses involving questionable and harsh interrogation tactics.", 
                "England's defense team has been arguing for nearly a year that her case was part of a bigger picture, initially trying to get top U.S. officials, including Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, to testify at her court martial about the nation's policies for handling and interrogating detainees.", 
                "They argued England was simply doing as she was told and as a low-ranking soldier, she wasn't in a position to question her orders.",

                "But those careful arrangements almost went awry in the stark military courtroom Monday when a skeptical Army judge raised questions about her admission of guilt.", 
                "In military law, a judge cannot accept a defendant's guilty plea without assurance that the plea is true.", 
                "England told the judge, Col. James L. Pohl, that she was sent to Iraq as a records clerk with the 372nd Military Police Company, based in Cumberland, Md., and had no training as a prison guard when the Army assigned her to work at Baghdad's toughest prison.",

                "'' After a brief recess for the lawyers to meet, England returned to the courtroom and said she knew at the time that use of the leash ``was not only morally wrong but legally wrong.", 
                "I had a choice, but I chose what my friends wanted me to do.", 
                "'' England went on to say she had deliberately done wrong in posing for other pictures, including one that showed seven naked prisoners forced to form a human pyramid.",

                "Described by investigators as a ringleader of the abuse, he was convicted at a court martial in January and is serving a 10-year sentence.", 
                "No senior officer at the prison, and no one higher up in the chain of command, has faced charges in the case.",

                "The 22-year-old private, who featured in some of the most graphic pictures of sexual humiliation of prisoners at the jail near Baghdad, told the hearing she had been following the orders of her former boyfriend, Specialist Charles Graner, one of the abuse ringleaders.", 
                "\"I assumed it was okay because he was an MP and he had the background of being a corrections officer,\" said England, who pled guilty to seven charges relating to the abuse of prisoners in October and November 2003.", 
                "The military judge, Colonel James Pohl, halted proceedings after England indicated that she did not believe her actions were wrong.", 
                "\"I want you to understand this is your trial.", 
                "I don't want you to plead guilty unless you are guilty,\" Pohl said.", 
                "England told how she was at the prison to visit friends and Graner had taken her into the cellblock where he was trying to get an uncooperative inmate out of his cell.", 
                "\"The detainee was on the ground,\" England said.", 
                "\"He (Graner) proceeded to tie the strap around his neck and he told the detainee to start crawling around the cell.",

                "\" The prisoner then crawled out of the cell with England holding the strap.", 
                "When the judge asked England why Graner handed her the strap, England replied: \"He wanted it to look more degrading with a female of my size.", 
                "\" Graner had also wanted other prisoners to witness the degradation.", 
                "\"It would be more humiliating to him.",

                "England reached a plea bargain with military prosecutors, who dropped a dereliction of duty charge and one of committing an indecent act when she was photographed performing fellatio on another solider.", 
                "That brings the maximum sentence she risks down to 11 years from the original 16-and-a-half years.", 
                "Her defense asked the judge to roll several maltreatment charges into one, which would bring the maximum sentence down to eight years.",

                "She was also photographed engaging in fellatio with Graner, the father of her newborn baby, who is serving a 10-year jail term for beating and sexually humiliating prisoners.",

                "The final hearing, that of Specialist Sabrina Harman, is scheduled to begin May 11.", 
                "A number of US investigations categorized the abuse as the isolated acts by a small group.",
