				"Pfc. Lynndie R. England, the 22-year-old woman who became an infamous presence in the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse photographs, pleaded guilty on Monday to seven of the nine counts against her, under an agreement with military prosecutors.",
				"England had faced up to 16 1/2 years in prison if convicted on all full nine counts, which included conspiracy, dereliction of duty, maltreatment and indecent acts. But one of her lawyers, Capt. Jonathan Crisp, said last week that England would enter a guilty plea at the pretrial hearing Monday on seven counts and then face sentencing by a military jury. The reduced charges carry a maximum sentence of 11 years.",
				"Two people close to the prosecution have said England can expect to receive no more than 30 months in prison.",
				"When the proceedings, at Fort Hood, Texas, resume on Tuesday, a military jury will be seated to hear evidence on sentencing. That phase of the proceedings is expected to last up to seven days, possibly including weekends, according to a statement from the Fort Hood public affairs office. The statement said England was charged with violations of the Uniform Code of Military Justice that occurred at the prison near Baghdad from October to December 2003.",
				"At the hearing Monday, the judge, Col. James L. Pohl, rejected a defense motion to recuse himself. Crisp, one of England's lawyers, had argued that it was not proper for Pohl to preside over her case because he had been involved in the other cases related to the Abu Ghraib scandal.",
				"Crisp said England's defense team would present evidence that she had a history of mental health problems and learning disabilities. He said her lawyers would also present evidence that another soldier, Spec. Charles A. Graner Jr., who military investigators say was the ringleader of the abuse and who was her boyfriend at the time, was a corrupting influence on her.",
				"England, an Army reservist from West Virginia, was shown in photographs from the prison holding a leash around the neck of a naked and crawling Iraqi detainee. In other photos, she appeared grinning or giving a thumbs-up over naked detainees, holding a cigarette between her teeth.",
				"She and six other soldiers implicated in the abuse were reservists with the 372nd Military Police Company based in Cresaptown, Md. Four have pleaded guilty in exchange for reduced punishments; one, Specialist Sabrina Harman, faces court-martial next month.",
				"Graner was convicted and sentenced in January to 10 years in prison and dismissed from the military. He is in a military prison in Leavenworth, Kan. The seven soldiers have said they were following orders."

				"Before accepting England's plea, Pohl carefully scrutinized the charges and the actions of the 22-year-old Army reservist.",
				"He asked England what happened in the facility outside Baghdad that caused the infamous scene of the prisoner being led by a leash. England responded that the man was refusing to cooperate with the guards and that her supervisor, Spec. Charles A. Graner Jr., told her to go get the strap and put it around the prisoner as a leash. He also instructed her to hold the prisoner because Graner said it would be more degrading to the man.",
				"Then Pohl asked England what training she had for prison work. England, who was a records clerk in the military before being assigned to Abu Ghraib, said she had none and told the judge she was unaware of the Geneva Conventions. But she said that Graner had worked as a civilian as a prison guard and she trusted his analysis of the situation.",
				"Pohl then said, ``I don't see how it would be illegal to pose for a photograph if you considered it legal.'' But after a recess, he accepted the plea deal.",
				"England, from Fort Ashby, W. Va., originally faced nine charges, but the Army agreed to drop two of those as part of the agreement. She pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy, four counts of maltreating prisoners and one count of dereliction of duty.",
				"Her defense lawyers said the deal was expected to reduce the maximum sentence she faced from 16 1/2 years in prison to 11.",
				"She is the seventh enlisted soldier to face criminal penalties in the Abu Ghraib case. No commissioned officers at the prison, and no senior officer in the chain of command, has been charged. Six enlisted soldiers have entered guilty pleas in the case.",
				"Graner, who reportedly fathered a child with England during their service in Iraq, faced a court-martial in January. He was convicted and sentenced to 10 years in prison despite his assertion that senior officers directed and approved the actions of guards in cellblock One-Alpha."

				"Pfc. Lynndie R. England, the young Army reservist whose grinning, thumbs-up image came to symbolize the worst of the Abu Ghraib prison scandal, told a military judge Monday that she knew the detainee abuses were wrong but went along because of peer pressure.",
				"Offering the most ordinary explanation to a scandal that ignited international outrage, England said she posed in some of the widely circulated photographs showing humiliating abuses of Iraqi detainees to placate her then-boyfriend and others from her Maryland-based unit.",
				"``I had a choice, but I chose to do what my friends wanted me to,'' England, 22, said in a glum voice as she pleaded guilty to mistreating detainees at the notorious Baghdad prison. ``They were being very persistent and bugging me, and I was like, OK, whatever.''",
				"England became one of the most visible and polarizing figures in the prison abuse scandal when the notorious photographs of naked and hooded Iraqi detainees enduring abuses at the hands of U.S. soldiers became public a year ago.",
				"The 5-foot, 1-inch soldier with the pixie haircut was shown flashing a thumbs-up behind a pyramid of naked prisoners in one photograph. In another, she has a cigarette clenched in her teeth as she grins and points at the genitals of a naked detainee. In one of the most vivid pictures from the scandal, England is shown holding a leather leash tied around the neck of a prisoner lying on the cellblock floor.",
				"Those photographs stood in stark contrast to the image of England when she returned to the United States early last year, pregnant (reportedly by the scandal's reputed ringleader, Charles Graner) and facing more than three decades in a military prison for her role in the abuses.",
				"Closing the last high-profile case in the scandal, England pleaded guilty Monday to two counts of conspiracy, four counts of mistreating detainees and one count of dereliction of duty.",
				"England, who gave birth to a son in October, now faces a maximum sentence of 11 years in military prison. But she is expected to face considerably less time than that under the undisclosed terms of her plea deal with prosecutors.",
				"A jury composed of Army officers and enlisted soldiers will be seated Tuesday morning to recommend a sentence for England as part of a penalty hearing expected to last several days. Under military law, she would receive the lesser punishment between what the jury recommends and what prosecutors have offered.",
				"England was one of seven members of the 372nd Military Police Company charged with humiliating and assaulting prisoners at Abu Ghraib. Four other members of the 372nd and two low-level military intelligence officers have entered guilty pleas in the abuse scandal and received sentences ranging from no time to 8 1/2 years.",
				"Spc. Sabrina Harman, a former Abu Ghraib guard, is scheduled to go to trial at Fort Hood next week.",
				"Graner is so far the only soldier charged in the scandal to contest the case against him at a military trial. He was convicted of every charge at a trial here in January and sentenced to 10 years in prison.",
				"Monday, Graner was back at the court building at Fort Hood, called as a possible witness for England in the penalty phase of her proceedings. England's attorneys are expected to argue as part of their mitigating case that England was led astray by Graner, whom she frequently sneaked out at night to visit at the prison's cellblock.",
				"The two no longer are romantically involved. After his conviction, Graner married fellow soldier and former co-defendant Megan Ambuhl; he is serving his sentence at the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kan.",
				"Under questioning Monday from Col. James L. Pohl, a military judge, England repeatedly said that she agreed at Graner's suggestion to appear in the photographs that outraged much of the Arab world and opened an embarrassing chapter in the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.",
				"When Pohl asked about the photograph showing England holding a detainee by a leash, she said it was Graner's idea: ``I assumed it was OK, because he was an MP. He had the background as a corrections officer, and, him being older than me, I thought he knew what he was doing.''",
				"England said she knew it was wrong when Graner pulled out his digital camera and started taking pictures of the episode ``for his own amusement.''",
				"Defense attorneys are expected to present evidence over the next few days that England has long suffered from mental problems and learning disabilities and was extremely susceptible to the influence of her peers.",
				"In court, England frequently appeared hesitant and unsure of her answers as Pohl asked whether she knew other various actions were wrong at the time she committed them -- a key legal test in determining whether a plea in military court can be accepted.",
				"The judge spent nearly three hours going over with England the details of an 11-page statement of facts that England acknowledged in her plea deal.",
				"``If you knew it was wrong, then why did you do it?'' Pohl asked again and again during the hearing. Referring to Graner, England repeatedly answered: ``He asked me to.''",
				"``Did you get any amusement out of it?'' Pohl asked at one point.",
				"``Not really,'' England said after a long pause. ``But I did what they wanted me to.''"

			"headline":"Private England Pleads Guilty",
			"sentences":[
				"Army Pfc. Lynndie R. England formally pleaded guilty Monday to mistreating inmates at Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison, with many of the seven counts related to her appearance in some of the most graphic photographs of the abuse that shocked the world last spring.",
				"Under a deal she made with military prosecutors, the reservist from Fort Ashby, W.Va., will serve less than the maximum term of 11 years in prison that could result from her guilty plea. She had faced nine counts and could have received up to 16 1/2 years. A military jury here will decide her sentence this week.",
				"England, 22, was perhaps the most familiar face in the notorious photos. She was pictured holding one inmate tethered to a leash. In another, she smiles and smokes a cigarette while pointing at a naked prisoner. Her involvement in a group of sexually humiliating scenarios went alongside images of military dogs attacking prisoners, soldiers carrying out physical assaults, and detainees being chained to their beds and cell doors in ``stress positions.''",
				"The emergence of the Abu Ghraib photographs spawned nearly a dozen defense department and military inquiries into detainee abuse and focused an international spotlight on U.S. detention operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. While government officials initially tried to minimize the Abu Ghraib abuses as being at the hands of a few bad apples in the Army Reserve, the larger investigations revealed widespread abuses involving questionable and harsh interrogation tactics.",
				"England's defense team has been arguing for nearly a year that her case was part of a bigger picture, initially trying to get top U.S. officials, including Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, to testify at her court martial about the nation's policies for handling and interrogating detainees. They argued England was simply doing as she was told and as a low-ranking soldier, she wasn't in a position to question her orders.",
				"Still, in the end England negotiated a plea. But those careful arrangements almost went awry in the stark military courtroom Monday when a skeptical Army judge raised questions about her admission of guilt.",
				"In military law, a judge cannot accept a defendant's guilty plea without assurance that the plea is true.",
				"England told the judge, Col. James L. Pohl, that she was sent to Iraq as a records clerk with the 372nd Military Police Company, based in Cumberland, Md., and had no training as a prison guard when the Army assigned her to work at Baghdad's toughest prison. When Pohl asked the defendant why she posed for the leash picture, she responded that she had been told to do so by then-Sgt. Charles A. Graner Jr, who was trained as a prison guard.",
				"``Did you question this procedure?'' the judge asked.",
				"``I assumed it was OK,'' England replied, ``because he was an MP (military police soldier), he had the corrections officer background. He was older than me.''",
				"Pohl appeared troubled by her answer, noting she had to have knowledge her actions were wrong to be legally culpable. He told prosecutors that ``it's going to be difficult to make a photograph of a lawful act into a crime.''",
				"After a brief recess for the lawyers to meet, England returned to the courtroom and said she knew at the time that use of the leash ``was not only morally wrong but legally wrong. I had a choice, but I chose what my friends wanted me to do.''",
				"England went on to say she had deliberately done wrong in posing for other pictures, including one that showed seven naked prisoners forced to form a human pyramid. ``I knew it was wrong,'' she said. ``Who would morally do something like that in a U.S. prison?''",
				"England becomes the eighth U.S. soldier to plead guilty or be convicted in relation to the Abu Ghraib abuses. Graner, the highest-ranking soldier implicated, was the only one to go to trial. Described by investigators as a ringleader of the abuse, he was convicted at a court martial in January and is serving a 10-year sentence.",
				"No senior officer at the prison, and no one higher up in the chain of command, has faced charges in the case. Last week, the Army's inspector general exonerated four generals in Iraq of any blame for Abu Ghraib.",
				"(optional add end)",
				"England became pregnant while in Iraq. Her child -- believed to be Graner's son -- is a few months old and is living with relatives.",
				"She told the judge Monday that many of the photos in which she is seen standing beside naked Iraqi inmates were taken late on the night of Nov. 7, 2003. She said she had gone to Cell Block One-Alpha that night to celebrate with the guards there; the next day was her 21st birthday."

				"Private Lynndie England, perhaps the most well-known in the  abuse scandal that occurred in the fall of 2003, pleaded guilty to seven charges, including two counts of conspiracy to maltreat  prisoners, four counts of maltreating prisoners and one count of  committing an indecent act.",
				"England, 22, reached a plea bargain with military prosecutors  last week, which would lower her maximum possible sentence from 16 and a half years in prison to 11 years. The prosecution dropped a  dereliction of duty charge and one of committing an indecent act.",
				"If the plea agreement was accepted by the military judge, a  jury of officers and soldiers would decide her punishment  following a sentencing hearing.",

				"The Abu Ghraib abuse scandal went public in April 2004, after  photographs showing American soldiers mistreating and humiliating  Iraqi prisoners surfaced. The scandal caused a widespread outrage, particularly in the Arab world, prompting President George W. Bush to apologize.",

				"Of the seven members of the 372nd Military Police Company  charged in the abuse scandal, four have previously entered guilty  pleas, and the only soldier to stand trial so far was Charles  Graner, who was serving a 10-year jail term."

			"sentences":[
				"A clique of U.S. soldiers tormented Iraqi detainees at Abu Ghraib prison for "amusement," not for any authorized military mission, Pfc. Lynndie England testified Monday as she pleaded guilty to seven abuse-related charges.",
				""I had a choice, but I chose to do what my friends wanted me to," the 22-year-old reservist said at her court-martial. "I was just yielding to peer pressure."",
				"A jury of U.S. Army troops will be selected today to set punishment, which could be a sentence from two to 11 years for conspiracy, indecency and maltreatment of detainees.",
				"England became the eighth enlisted soldier to be found guilty of 2003 Abu Ghraib crimes that continue to taint the reputations of the United States and its military. The most severe punishment was set at 10 years for Pvt. Charles Graner, who orchestrated many of the abuses and will be called as a witness for England.",
				"She and Graner, both from the Maryland-based 372nd Military Police Company, were romantically involved while in Iraq. England gave birth to his son in October, months after they broke up. Last month, the imprisoned Graner was married by proxy to co-defendant Megan Ambuhl.",
				"Graner is crucial to England's claim that she followed his lead at Abu Ghraib, where he was a guard and she was a clerk.",
				"Before accepting her guilty pleas, the judge, Col. James Pohl, required England to clearly describe her wrongdoing and motives. Asked if she had been ordered by her chain of command to mistreat inmates, England replied, "No, sir."",
				"Queried how she knew it was wrong to pose in a photo with nude inmates being forced to masturbate, England said: "Anybody could be offended seeing that picture."",
				"The interrogation produced repeated statements by England that soldiers abused Iraqis "for their own amusement," and admissions that she participated "because they asked me to."",
				"But she also confirmed to the judge's satisfaction that she knew it was wrong to engage in the abuses, regardless of the fact that Graner and another abusive soldier had backgrounds as civilian prison guards.",
				"Explaining perhaps the most notorious photo in which she appeared, England said the main reason she held an Iraqi on a leash was because Graner told her to. Graner had said he wanted to photograph the 5-foot-1 England controlling the nude Iraqi to instill fear in other inmates, she claimed.",
				""He wanted it to look more degrading and humiliating, with a female of my size," she said. But she quickly realized Graner's explanation that he needed to abuse the detainees in order to "control" them was not true.",
				""I thought it was not only morally wrong but legally wrong," she said.",
				"England also conceded that during most of her misdeeds, she was visiting Graner and other friends from her company, but wasn't always on official business in the maximum security wing where they worked.",
				"England also backed off from earlier assertions that the tormenting of detainees was part of an effort to soften them up for intelligence agents. Although guards were told to deprive detainees of sleep, manipulate their meal schedules and force them to maintain awkward positions to cause stress, England said, "no, sir," when asked if any of her crimes were done to help interrogators.",
				"Officers and enlisted soldiers who will set England's punishment are expected to hear testimony from several defense witnesses, including psychology and sociology experts, as well as Graner.",
				"In a sentencing hearing likely to last several days, jurors also could hear a prosecution witness who is expected to describe England's job performance while in Iraq, which included admonishments for her affair with Graner."

				"Lynndie England on Monday pled  guilty to charges of abusing Iraqi prisoners at the Abu Ghraib  prison but told a court martial she did not believe she was doing  wrong when photographed holding a leash on a naked inmate.",
				"The 22-year-old private, who featured in some of the most  graphic pictures of sexual humiliation of prisoners at the jail near  Baghdad, told the hearing she had been following the orders of her  former boyfriend, Specialist Charles Graner, one of the abuse  ringleaders.",
				""I assumed it was okay because he was an MP and he had the  background of being a corrections officer," said England, who pled  guilty to seven charges relating to the abuse of prisoners in  October and November 2003.",
				"The military judge, Colonel James Pohl, halted proceedings after  England indicated that she did not believe her actions were wrong.",
				""I want you to understand this is your trial. I don't want you  to plead guilty unless you are guilty," Pohl said.",
				"England told how she was at the prison to visit friends and  Graner had taken her into the cellblock where he was trying to get  an uncooperative inmate out of his cell.",
				""The detainee was on the ground," England said. "He (Graner)  proceeded to tie the strap around his neck and he told the detainee  to start crawling around the cell. When the detainee would not do  that he had me hold the strap."",
				"The prisoner then crawled out of the cell with England holding  the strap.",
				"When the judge asked England why Graner handed her the strap,  England replied: "He wanted it to look more degrading with a female  of my size." Graner had also wanted other prisoners to witness the  degradation. "It would be more humiliating to him."",
				"England said she believed Graner took the pictures "for his own  amusement."",
				"The abuse pictures were shown around the world and led to  widespread condemnation of US practices in Iraq at a time when it  was still trying to bring the country under control after the 2003  invasion.",
				"England reached a plea bargain with military prosecutors, who  dropped a dereliction of duty charge and one of committing an  indecent act when she was photographed performing fellatio on  another solider.",
				"That brings the maximum sentence she risks down to 11 years from  the original 16-and-a-half years.",
				"Her defense asked the judge to roll several maltreatment charges  into one, which would bring the maximum sentence down to eight  years.",
				"England's lawyer, Rick Hernandez, asked Pohl to recuse himself  because he had presided over all the other Abu Ghraib abuse cases.  Hernandez said this "gives the appearance of bias." But the judge  rejected the demand and England went on to make her plea.",
				"The proposed punishment under the plea bargain with prosecutors  will remain secret until after the military jury decides the  sentence it believes she should face. England will then receive the  lesser of the two sentences.",
				"England was accused of posing for a number of photographs.",
				"As well as the infamous image holding a leash, England is also  seen pointing to the word "rapeist" (sic) written on the exposed  buttocks of a prisoner.",
				"She also posed with naked prisoners who formed a human pyramid  and some who had been forced to masturbate. She was also  photographed engaging in fellatio with Graner, the father of her  newborn baby, who is serving a 10-year jail term for beating and  sexually humiliating prisoners.",
				"Graner is reported to have married another soldier charged in  the scandal, Megan Ambuhl, who pleaded guilty and received a  dishonorable discharge.",
				"Of the eight soldiers charged over the Abu Ghraib scandal, only  Graner's case has gone to trial.",
				"Five soldiers pled guilty and received sentences ranging from a  dishonorable discharge to eight years in prison. The final hearing,  that of Specialist Sabrina Harman, is scheduled to begin May 11.",
				"A number of US investigations categorized the abuse as the  isolated acts by a small group. But many groups have raised  suspicions that the US administration has protected the upper ranks.  US rights groups have called for a special prosecutor to look into  torture allegations.",
				"Some top officers have received nonjudicial punishment,  including Brigadier General Janis Karpinski, commander of the  military police unit at Abu Ghraib, was relieved of her command and  reprimanded.",
				"The senior US military commander in Iraq at the time, Lieutenant  General Ricardo Sanchez, and three other high-ranking officers were  cleared of any wrongdoing by a US military probe."
