                "Wailing and shouting, hundreds of thousands of mourners made their way in a somber but angry procession Wednesday from the home of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri to his burial place in the grounds of an unfinished mosque that was one of his favorite reconstruction projects.", 
                "Hariri, a popular figure to many in Lebanon and a central figure in reconstructing the country after a devastating 15-year civil war, was assassinated on Monday in an explosion that many here believe was the work of Syria, whose forces have played a dominant role in Lebanon since the 1970s.", 
                "Lebanese from all walks of life and religious groups, many waving Lebanese flags and posters saying \"Syria Out!", 
                "\" and \"We Don't Want You!", 
                "\" walked for more than two hours in an emotional but orderly manner from Hariri's home to Martyr's Square.", 
                "The procession of mourners, which was larger than expected, included Hariri's three sons, Bahaa, Saadeldine and Ayman, and, in a break with Islamic tradition, hundreds of weeping women.", 
                "Although the crowd's sorrow was mixed with anger, there was no tension in the air, and the procession was conducted in an orderly way.", 
                "The family believes that Hariri's death was caused in part by the government's failure to provide security, and at their request no government officials attended the funeral.", 
                "The family also said it did not want a state funeral but one that the people of Lebanon could attend.", 
                "And although police officials provided security, there were no Lebanese soldiers to be seen.", 
                "Crowds had begun jamming the streets in Martyr's Square in downtown Beirut since 9:30 a.m. As a result the procession found it difficult to enter and did not arrive in time for the regular noonday prayers at the massive Mohammed Amine mosque, an impressive building with four minarets that is to replace a mosque destroyed in the civil war.", 
                "Ambulances carrying the coffin of Hariri and six of his bodyguards and a paramedic who were also killed in the blast, were brought to a halt at the edge of the square.", 
                "Seven of the coffins were first placed on the ground, and that of Hariri, draped in a red, white and green Lebanese flag, was passed overhead by the mourners.", 
                "Hariri's eldest son, Bahaa, asked for calm from the wailing crowd so that prayers for the dead could be read, but many of the mourners were too emotional and did not join in the prayers.", 
                "The Islamic call to prayer was mixed with sounds of church bells and mourners chanting slogans of reverence for the former prime minister.", 
                "Hariri and the other victims were then laid to rest in the grounds of the new mosque.", 
                "Watching the ceremony from the steps of the mosque, outside the prayer area, were Hariri's two daughters and his sister, who is also a member of Parliament.", 
                "Later, at her home, Hariri's wife, Nazik, met President Jacques Chirac of France, a close friend of the ex-prime minister, who had come to pay his condolences."

                "Hariri, 60, died on Monday when his motorcade was blown up by a suicide car bomber in western Beirut seafront.", 
                "At least 14 others were killed.", 
                "It was too early to say who killed Hariri who resigned as prime minister last October though oppositions held Syria and its allied Lebanese government responsible for Hariri's murder.",
