				"A friend of mine was killed in Beirut Monday in a massive car bomb attack. He was Rafik Hariri, a former and a future prime minister of Lebanon. He was a billionaire, and more important, a philanthropist. Through his foundation and with his money, more than 30,000 young Lebanese men and women received university educations in the United States, Europe and Lebanon.",
				"Why does his death matter? Hariri was important to Lebanon as a politician and a symbol. When I first met Rafik nearly 20 years ago, he had been spending the war years outside his native Lebanon, making friends and a fortune in Saudi Arabia. His friends included the Saudi royal family. His foundation was already helping young people head off to college. When I first met him, I thought that Rafik was a talented man and a raw politician. He always had vision. Our first conversations were about how to bring peace between Israel and the Arabs. As the years passed he became more experienced, polished and proficient.",
				"Hariri was prime minister for 10 of the 14 years since Lebanon's 15-year war ended in 1990. More than anyone else, he was responsible for the rebuilding of Beirut and the country's infrastructure. He was sometimes called a \"bulldozer\" for his power to push through problems, but a ruined country needed a bulldozer to clear away the debris.",
				"He learned to campaign well in remarkably lively parliamentary elections. His opponents accused him of saddling the country with debt in financing the reconstruction. He asked whether it would have been better to live in ruins.",
				"Over the years, Hariri became more and more concerned with Syrian influence in Lebanon, a product of Syria's military and intelligence presence left over from the war. Last September, the United States and France joined together in the United Nations Security Council to pass Resolution 1559, calling for free elections and the withdrawal of all foreign forces (read Syria) from Lebanon. Hariri was known to be a friend of French President Jacques Chirac and had been to Washington to meet with President Bush on several occasions.",
				"In September, Hariri was known to have opposed the Syrian-imposed three-year extension in the length of the term for Lebanon's president. He resigned the prime ministry shortly thereafter. In recent weeks he was working on a comeback in the parliamentary elections scheduled for May. Part of his maneuvers included potentially making common cause with the Lebanese politicians who are openly demanding that the Syrian forces get out of Lebanon.",
				"Hariri was important as a symbol of Lebanon to the outside world. A successful businessman, a kind benefactor, Hariri was a practicing and observant Sunni Muslim who was at home in Beirut, Saudi Arabia, New York and Paris. Hariri had an Atlanta connection, quietly coming each year to Emory Medical Center for a checkup.",
				"Rafik Hariri was the antithesis of Osama bin Laden. Hariri's sister, Bahia, chairs the Education Committee in the Lebanese Parliament. Last week she hosted a conference in Beirut for women in politics from all over the Middle East.",
				"I saw Hariri each time I visited Beirut, whether he was in office or out. He was always optimistic. During one such visit we discussed the concern of many over Syria. He never uttered an uncomplimentary word about the Syrian leadership. I told him that many of my Lebanese friends were worried that Lebanon would become more like Syria, with free speech stifled. I said that I thought that over time, it will be the reverse: Syria will become more like Lebanon.",
				"Every Syrian who comes to Beirut feels as if he has come from a smoke-filled room to a place with fresh air. The more the Syrians experience the fresh air of Lebanon, the more they will want it in Syria. It is the Syrian system that will change. Hariri smiled.",
				"Lebanon has lost a leader, a larger-than-life figure who did much good. Hariri wan not perfect -- no human is. His death matters. Out of his death comes a stronger need to defend the fresh air of Lebanon.",
				"There are fresh winds blowing through all of the Arab world, of elections and education and a new role for women. The success of those winds will not come from the outside but from Arabs of vision and optimism, men and women like Rafik Hariri.",
				"John H. Kelly was assistant secretary of state for the Near East and South Asia from 1989 to 1991. "

				"Wailing and shouting, hundreds of thousands of mourners made their way in a somber but angry procession Wednesday from the home of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri to his burial place in the grounds of an unfinished mosque that was one of his favorite reconstruction projects.",
				"Hariri, a popular figure to many in Lebanon and a central figure in reconstructing the country after a devastating 15-year civil war, was assassinated on Monday in an explosion that many here believe was the work of Syria, whose forces have played a dominant role in Lebanon since the 1970s.",
				"Lebanese from all walks of life and religious groups, many waving Lebanese flags and posters saying \"Syria Out!\" and \"We Don't Want You!\" walked for more than two hours in an emotional but orderly manner from Hariri's home to Martyr's Square.",
				"The procession of mourners, which was larger than expected, included Hariri's three sons, Bahaa, Saadeldine and Ayman, and, in a break with Islamic tradition, hundreds of weeping women. Although the crowd's sorrow was mixed with anger, there was no tension in the air, and the procession was conducted in an orderly way.",
				"The family believes that Hariri's death was caused in part by the government's failure to provide security, and at their request no government officials attended the funeral. The family also said it did not want a state funeral but one that the people of Lebanon could attend. And although police officials provided security, there were no Lebanese soldiers to be seen.",
				"Crowds had begun jamming the streets in Martyr's Square in downtown Beirut since 9:30 a.m.",
				"As a result the procession found it difficult to enter and did not arrive in time for the regular noonday prayers at the massive Mohammed Amine mosque, an impressive building with four minarets that is to replace a mosque destroyed in the civil war.",
				"Ambulances carrying the coffin of Hariri and six of his bodyguards and a paramedic who were also killed in the blast, were brought to a halt at the edge of the square.",
				"Seven of the coffins were first placed on the ground, and that of Hariri, draped in a red, white and green Lebanese flag, was passed overhead by the mourners.",
				"Hariri's eldest son, Bahaa, asked for calm from the wailing crowd so that prayers for the dead could be read, but many of the mourners were too emotional and did not join in the prayers.",
				"The Islamic call to prayer was mixed with sounds of church bells and mourners chanting slogans of reverence for the former prime minister.",
				"Hariri and the other victims were then laid to rest in the grounds of the new mosque.",
				"Watching the ceremony from the steps of the mosque, outside the prayer area, were Hariri's two daughters and his sister, who is also a member of Parliament.",
				"Later, at her home, Hariri's wife, Nazik, met President Jacques Chirac of France, a close friend of the ex-prime minister, who had come to pay his condolences. "

				"The bombing has also led to renewed international pressure led by the US and France for Syria to withdraw its 14,000 troops from neighboring Lebanon. "

				"The crowd began massing quietly in front of Rafik Hariri's mansion in the early dawn hours Wednesday as Lebanon prepared to bury him and the six bodyguards who were killed with him in a bomb blast on Monday.",
				"They came from throughout the country in an emotional and politically charged tribute to Hariri, the former prime minister, billionaire developer and architect of Lebanon's revival from a devastating 15-year civil war. Some climbed lampposts while others hung from balconies, trying to catch a glimpse of the ambulance carrying his coffin, often breaking into wails as they chanted \"There is no God but God\" and \"Hariri is loved by God.\"",
				"Eventually, well over 100,000 marched down streets festooned with Lebanese flags, shouting \"Syria Out\" in protest of the dominant role Syria's forces have played in the country since the 1970s. Opposition politicians and the United States have strongly suggested Syria had a hand in the bombing of Hariri's motorcade.",
				"At the Hariri family's urging, Lebanon's pro-Syrian president, Emile Lahoud, stayed away from the funeral, but hundreds of women, breaking with Islamic tradition, joined in the march.",
				"The rites were organized by the Hariri family, which refused a state funeral to underscore its anger at the government. The meandering two-hour march through the streets became as much a show of Lebanon's struggle for unity as an occasion for mourning. Many Christians, Muslims and Druse, once bitter enemies, walked side by side.",
				"The red flags of the Druse leader Walid Jumblatt's Socialist Party and the green cedar flags of the Phalangist Party, also enemies in the war, fluttered together in the sea of people that descended into the funeral grounds in front of the unfinished Amin Mosque. \"Brothers, we must all grieve together,\" one imam told the mourners.",
				"It seemed that the most far-reaching effect of the assassination would be a fundamental change in the relationship between Lebanon and Syria, with a newly emboldened opposition movement renewing calls for Syria's withdrawal.",
				"Syria has denied any involvement in the bombing. But Hariri's supporters have accused Syria and the Lebanese government of orchestrating the assassination. "
