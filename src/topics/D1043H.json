				"Hariri, a popular figure to many in Lebanon and a central figure in reconstructing the country after a devastating 15-year civil war, was assassinated on Monday in an explosion that many here believe was the work of Syria, whose forces have played a dominant role in Lebanon since the 1970s.",
				"Lebanese from all walks of life and religious groups, many waving Lebanese flags and posters saying \"Syria Out!\" and \"We Don't Want You!\" walked for more than two hours in an emotional but orderly manner from Hariri's home to Martyr's Square.",
				"The procession of mourners, which was larger than expected, included Hariri's three sons, Bahaa, Saadeldine and Ayman, and, in a break with Islamic tradition, hundreds of weeping women.",
				"Although the crowd's sorrow was mixed with anger, there was no tension in the air, and the procession was conducted in an orderly way.",
				"The family believes that Hariri's death was caused in part by the government's failure to provide security, and at their request no government officials attended the funeral.",
				"The family also said it did not want a state funeral but one that the people of Lebanon could attend.",
				"And although police officials provided security, there were no Lebanese soldiers to be seen.",
				"Crowds had begun jamming the streets in Martyr's Square in downtown Beirut since 9:30 a.m.",
				"As a result the procession found it difficult to enter and did not arrive in time for the regular noonday prayers at the massive Mohammed Amine mosque, an impressive building with four minarets that is to replace a mosque destroyed in the civil war.",
				"Ambulances carrying the coffin of Hariri and six of his bodyguards and a paramedic who were also killed in the blast, were brought to a halt at the edge of the square.",
				"Seven of the coffins were first placed on the ground, and that of Hariri, draped in a red, white and green Lebanese flag, was passed overhead by the mourners.",
				"Hariri's eldest son, Bahaa, asked for calm from the wailing crowd so that prayers for the dead could be read, but many of the mourners were too emotional and did not join in the prayers.",
				"The Islamic call to prayer was mixed with sounds of church bells and mourners chanting slogans of reverence for the former prime minister.",
				"Hariri and the other victims were then laid to rest in the grounds of the new mosque.",
				"Watching the ceremony from the steps of the mosque, outside the prayer area, were Hariri's two daughters and his sister, who is also a member of Parliament.",
				"Later, at her home, Hariri's wife, Nazik, met President Jacques Chirac of France, a close friend of the ex-prime minister, who had come to pay his condolences."

				"The bombing has also led to renewed international pressure led by the US and France for Syria to withdraw its 14,000 troops from neighboring Lebanon."

				"Some climbed lampposts while others hung from balconies, trying to catch a glimpse of the ambulance carrying his coffin, often breaking into wails as they chanted \"There is no God but God\" and \"Hariri is loved by God.\" Eventually, well over 100,000 marched down streets festooned with Lebanese flags, shouting \"Syria Out\" in protest of the dominant role Syria's forces have played in the country since the 1970s.",
				"Opposition politicians and the United States have strongly suggested Syria had a hand in the bombing of Hariri's motorcade.",
				"At the Hariri family's urging, Lebanon's pro-Syrian president, Emile Lahoud, stayed away from the funeral, but hundreds of women, breaking with Islamic tradition, joined in the march.",
				"The rites were organized by the Hariri family, which refused a state funeral to underscore its anger at the government.",
				"The meandering two-hour march through the streets became as much a show of Lebanon's struggle for unity as an occasion for mourning.",
				"Many Christians, Muslims and Druse, once bitter enemies, walked side by side.",
				"The red flags of the Druse leader Walid Jumblatt's Socialist Party and the green cedar flags of the Phalangist Party, also enemies in the war, fluttered together in the sea of people that descended into the funeral grounds in front of the unfinished Amin Mosque.",
				"\"Brothers, we must all grieve together,\" one imam told the mourners.",
				"It seemed that the most far-reaching effect of the assassination would be a fundamental change in the relationship between Lebanon and Syria, with a newly emboldened opposition movement renewing calls for Syria's withdrawal.",
				"Syria has denied any involvement in the bombing.",
				"But Hariri's supporters have accused Syria and the Lebanese government of orchestrating the assassination."
