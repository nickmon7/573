				"\"The vast majority of contaminated foods has now been removed and that provides some reassurance to consumers,\" he said in a statement.",
				"\"However, there may be some products remaining both in shops and in the catering sector and we will continue to work with local authorities to remove them as far is practical and achievable.\" Determined to find out how traces of the dye found their way into Britain's food chain, the FSA said it was conducting its largest ever investigation with the help of five local authorities.",

				"Asked whether any action had been taken with the companies, the spokesman said: \"The investigation is ongoing.\" The agency said in the statement it has advised the local authorities to consider whether to take \"enforcement action\" based on the evidence gathered.",
				"Under British law, companies and their executives could face prosecution, unlimited fines and two years in prison, for failure to ensure that food placed on the market is safe and fit for human consumption.",
				"The five local authorities involved in the investigation are in Essex and Lincolnshire counties and in the towns of South Holland, Rochdale and Basildon.",

				"Despite prompting an increased risk of cancer, the FSA has emphasised that the actual danger is very small given the levels present.",
