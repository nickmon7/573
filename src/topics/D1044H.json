                " Britain's Food Standards Agency on Friday issued an urgent warning advising people not to eat more than 350 food products inadvertently contaminated with an illegal dye.", 
                "The dye, known as Sudan I, is linked to an increased risk of cancer, but is not thought to be a risk to health at the concentrations used in these products, said a BBC report.", 
                "The dye got into a batch of chilli powder which was used in a large consignment of Crosse and Blackwell Worcester Sauce made by Premier Foods.", 
                "The sauce was then added as an ingredient to at least 359 products made by supermarkets and leading food companies such as Unilever.", 
                "Sudan 1 is a red dye used for coloring solvents, oils waxes, petrol and shoe polish and it is illegal to add it to food in Britain and the whole EU region.", 
                "However, FSA chief executive Jon Bell told Sky News: \"There is no risk of immediate illness and the general risk is very small.", 
                "\"Clearly if anyone has any products throw them away or return them,\" he added.", 
                "\"Because of the widespread use of this Worcester sauce to flavor other foods, we may find further affected products.", 
                "We will continue to take action to remove these and minimize the risk to consumers,\" he said.", 
                "Bell said the problem was uncovered when supplies reached an Italian company which tested for Sudan 1. "

                "It has ordered supermarkets over the past week to discard a growing list of food tainted by the illegal Sudan I dye and instructed food manufacturers to reveal any other affected products.", 
                "\"This has been an enormous undertaking.", 
                "Hundreds of products have been affected in thousands of shops,\" said David Statham, the FSA's director of enforcement, as the agency added another 146 items to its black list.",

                "Asked whether any action had been taken with the companies, the spokesman said: \"The investigation is ongoing.",

                "Under British law, companies and their executives could face prosecution, unlimited fines and two years in prison, for failure to ensure that food placed on the market is safe and fit for human consumption.",

                "The red-coloured dye, which is used for colouring non-edible items such as gasoline and shoe polish, was found in a batch of chilli powder used by the British company Premier Foods to make Worcester sauce, which was then added as an ingredient in a wide range of products.",
