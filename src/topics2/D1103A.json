                "More than 600 witnesses and 107 experts have been called to testify in what prosecutors claim was an Al-Qaeda-inspired attack by radical Islamists in retribution for Spain's participation in the US-led interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan.", 
                "The trial will get underway from 10 am (0900 GMT) amid ultra-tight security at the high court venue on the outskirts of Madrid, and is expected to last some six months.", 
                "One of the four alleged masterminds of the coordinated bombings of four packed Madrid commuter trains on March 11, 2004, Rabei Ousmane Sayed Ahmed, alias \"Mohammed the Egyptian,\" was expected to be the first called to testify.", 
                "He is one of seven men facing sentences of some 40,000 years each for the deaths and membership in a terrorist organisation, although under Spanish law the longest jail term anyone can actually serve is 40 years.", 
                "The others accused will stand trial for lesser offences, including collaboration with a terrorist group and falsifying documents.", 
                "All those on trial will give evidence from a bullet-proof box at the venue.", 
                "Media, survivors and relatives of the victims will be able to watch via closed circuit television in different rooms, although a handful of seats in the 180-seat courtroom have been reserved for the public.", 
                "The four alleged masterminds spent a year planning the worst terror attack in Europe since the December 1988 bombing of a PanAm jet over the Scottish town of Lockerbie that killed 270 people.", 
                "The three bombers placed bags packed with some 10 kilogrammes (22 pounds) of explosives on four commuter trains during the busy morning rush hour, then left and activated the devices by mobile telephone.", 
                "Three of the four alleged masterminds of the bombings will be in the dock: Ousmane, Youssef Belhadj, alias \"the Afghan\" and Hassan el-Haski, alias \"Abu Hamza.", 
                "\" Sarhane ben Abdelmajid Fakhet, alias \"the Tunisian,\" who prosecutors believe \"led and coordinated\" the attacks, was one of seven men who died after blowing themselves up during a police raid on an apartment in the Madrid suburb of Leganes three weeks after the attacks.", 
                "The three alleged bombers and the Spaniard who has been accused of supplying the explosives from a disused mine in exchange for drugs will also be in the dock.", 
                "In his charge sheet drawn up 10 months ago, examining magistrate Juan del Olmo attributed the attacks to the Moroccan Islamic Combat Group, a North African Al- Qaeda offshoot.", 
                "The prosecution says the \"final detonator\" for the train bombings was a message broadcast by Arab television channel Al-Jazeera on October 18, 2003, from Al- Qaeda's fugitive leader Osama bin Laden naming Spain as a potential target.", 
                "Victim groups say they hope the trial, whose verdict is due in October, will finally enable them to turn the page."

                "But the man, Rabei Osman Sayed Ahmed -- expected to be the first of 29 defendants to take the stand when the bombing trial begins Thursday in Madrid -- also said in the recordings that the attack was carried out according to his plan.", 
                "He said he only wished that he himself had been graced with death that day.", 
                "\"I am the thread behind the Madrid plot,\" Ahmed, an Egyptian militant, told a prospective suicide bomber in a bugged house in Milan, Italy, in May 2004.", 
                "\"I wanted to plan it so it would be something unforgettable, including myself because I was ready to blow myself up.", 
                "But they stopped me.", 
                "\" At the start of a trial laden with anger and unresolved grief, Spanish officials and news media have focused on Ahmed, a man with a well-documented legal trail.", 
                "In November, he was convicted in Milan, where he was arrested in 2004, three months after the Madrid bombings, on charges of conspiracy to participate in international terrorist activities.", 
                "Prosecutors convinced a panel of judges that those activities included strong links with the Madrid bombers.", 
                "Accounts of secret recordings of Ahmed and other evidence released after the Rome trial suggest that Muslim militants were highly mobile and in frequent contact with one another, discussing not only attacks in Europe but also recruitment for suicide bombers in Iraq.", 
                "\"This case is the first to show a clear link between terrorists prepared to carry out suicide missions in Iraq as well as in Europe,\" a senior Italian investigator said.", 
                "But since Ahmed's arrest, questions have hovered about whether he was a dangerous operative or something of a braggart puffed up by too much time spent on violent jihadist Web sites.", 
                "Luca D'Auria, his defense lawyer in Italy and in Spain, said that as much as Ahmed talked, no direct link from him to the bombers was proved.", 
                "Seven major suspects blew themselves up en masse in Madrid on April 3, 2004, weeks after the train bombings, as the Spanish police closed in on them.", 
                "Among them was Sarhane ben Abdelmajid Fakhet, known as the Tunisian, who has been identified as the operational mastermind of the bombings.", 
                "Like Ahmed -- considered an \"intellectual author\" of the bombings -- two other defendants are considered ideological planners: Hassan el-Haski, a Moroccan who was the leader of a group also accused of carrying out a deadly bombing in Casablanca, Morocco, in 2003; and Youssef Belhadj, also Moroccan, who was arrested in Brussels, Belgium, in 2005.", 
                "Among the other defendants are two of the men charged with the actual bombings: Jamal Zougam and Abdelmajid Bouchar, both Moroccan.", 
                "If convicted, Ahmed, 35, faces prison time that could total nearly 40,000 years, but under Spanish law, he would not serve more than 40 years.", 
                "Here in Italy, he was given a 10-year sentence, which he is appealing.", 
                "He was extradited to Spain in mid-November.", 
                "During his nine-month trial in Milan, prosecutors presented evidence portraying Ahmed as a dedicated warrior, providing a window into the workings and motivations of suspected terrorist cells.", 
                "He constantly moved around Europe, living in Germany, Spain, France and Italy since 1999.", 
                "Apart from the accusations that Ahmed has ties to the Madrid bombers, court papers here say that he was also in contact with a group in the Netherlands linked to the killing of the film director Theo van Gogh later in 2004.", 
                "In addition, he was accused of grooming Yahia Ragheh, his co-defendant in the trial here, to become a suicide bomber to be smuggled into Syria.", 
                "Ragheh was sentenced to five years in prison.", 
                "In all, his hatred of the West and his willingness to use violence in the name of God against it are a recurring theme in the transcripts.", 
                "\"The time has come for our war,\" he told Ragheh in one intercepted conversation.",

                "The trial opened Thursday of 29 suspects charged with involvement in the 2004 Madrid train bomb attacks, which killed 191 people in one of Europe's worst terror strikes.", 
                "The prosecution alleges that the March 11 attacks, which left more than 1,800 injured, were the work of mainly Moroccan Islamic extremists inspired by Al- Qaeda and angered by Spanish military participation in Iraq.", 
                "The trial, which opened amid tight security at a high court venue on the outskirts of Madrid, is expected to hear evidence from some 600 witnesses and around 100 experts, and to last some five months before an October verdict.", 
                "The proceedings began with one of the four alleged masterminds of the coordinated bombings, Rabei Ousmane Sayed Ahmed, alias \"Mohammed the Egyptian,\" rejecting all charges against him and refusing to give evidence.", 
                "The blasts on four packed commuter trains were the biggest in the Western world since the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States.", 
                "Squadrons of police were outside the court, many of them armed, others with dogs, while a helicopter flew overhead.", 
                "The accused were brought to the venue in two armoured police vans, which arrived with sirens wailing.", 
                "\"It's going to be difficult to look in the eye those who destroyed my life but I will do it for my son,\" said Pilar Manjon, a woman who lost her son in the attacks and who chairs a victim support association.", 
                "\"My legs are trembling, I'm afraid.", 
                "My stomach is churning,\" said a tearful Manjon, who briefly addressed reporters and emotionally embraced her lawyer before heading into court.", 
                "\"Mohammed the Egyptian\" is alleged to have boasted in intercepted telephone calls that the whole Madrid operation was \"my idea.", 
                "\" He is one of seven defendants facing sentences of some 40,000 years each for the deaths and membership of a terrorist organisation, although under Spanish law the longest jail term anyone can actually serve is 40 years.", 
                "The other accused will stand trial for lesser offences, including collaboration with a terrorist group.", 
                "Dozens of survivors and relatives of the victims will follow the proceedings on the spot, some in the courtroom itself but mostly from a separate room where they will watch on a flatscreen.", 
                "A just-released report by psychiatrists and social workers involved with helping the survivors and relatives overcome their trauma showed that almost one in five survivors have not been on a train since.", 
                "The accused were to give evidence from a bullet-proof box.", 
                "The four alleged masterminds spent a year planning the worst terror attack in Europe since the December 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet over the Scottish town of Lockerbie that killed 270 people.", 
                "Three of the four will be in the dock: Ousmane, Youssef Belhadj, alias \"the Afghan\" and Hassan el-Haski, alias \"Abu Hamza.", 
                "\" Seven men who \"led and coordinated\" the attacks blew themselves up in a police raid three weeks later.", 
                "The prosecution says the \"final detonator\" for the train bombings was a message broadcast by Arab television channel Al-Jazeera on October 18, 2003, from Al- Qaeda's fugitive leader Osama bin Laden naming Spain as a potential target."
