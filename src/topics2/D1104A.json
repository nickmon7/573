                "Pet owners were worried Saturday that the pet food in their cupboard may be deadly after millions of containers of dog and cat food sold at major retailers across North America were recalled.", 
                "Menu Foods, the Ontario-based company that produced the pet food, said Saturday it was recalling dog food sold under 48 brands and cat food sold under 40 brands including Iams, Nutro and Eukanuba.", 
                "The food was distributed throughout the United States, Canada and Mexico by major retailers such as Wal-Mart, Kroger and Safeway.", 
                "An unknown number of cats and dogs had suffered kidney failure and about 10 died after eating the affected pet food, the company said.", 
                "Many stores that sold the affected brands frantically pulled packages off shelves.", 
                "At a Petsmart store in Union, Silviene Grzybowski became worried when the four types of Iams products she buys for her cat, Smokey, had vanished from shelves.", 
                "The cat was very sick and had not been eating for days, she said.", 
                "\"The vet told us to buy her her favorite food, but I'm going to call the vet right now,\" Grzybowski said, looking at an announcement Petsmart had taped to shelves announcing the recall.", 
                "A complete list of the recalled products along with product codes, descriptions and production dates was available from the Menu Foods Web site, http://www.menufoods.com/recall.", 
                "Menu Foods' chief executive and president Paul Henderson told the Associated Press on Friday that the company was still trying to figure out what happened.", 
                "He said that the company had received an undisclosed number of owner complaints that dogs and cats were vomiting and suffering kidney failure after eating its products.", 
                "The recall covers the company's \"cuts and gravy\" style food, which consists of chunks of meat in gravy, sold in cans and small foil pouches from Dec. 3 to March 6.", 
                "In Omaha, Nebraska, Susan Balvanz said she sometimes feeds her five cats packets of sliced meat and gravy sold by Nutro Products, one of the brands affected.", 
                "\"I've done so much research on pet food.", 
                "It didn't surprise me but it scared me all the same,\" said Balvanz.", 
                "She said her 9-year-old cat, Boots, was especially fond of the food but seemed to have lost its appetite in the last few days.", 
                "At the Missouri Valley Veterinary Clinic in Bismarck, North Dakota, veterinarian Jacob Carlson has been referring worried pet owners to the Menu Foods web site.", 
                "\"We've had a lot of calls,\" Carlson said, although none of his patients were sick.", 
                "The company said it makes pet food for 17 of the top 20 North American retailers.", 
                "It is also a contract manufacturer for the top branded pet food companies, including Procter &amp; Gamble Co. ------ Associated Press writers Phyllis Mensing in Bismarck, North Dakota, and Rebecca Santana in Trenton, New Jersey, also contributed to this report."

                "The food was distributed throughout the United States, Canada and Mexico by major retailers such as Wal-Mart, Kroger and Safeway.", 
                "An unknown number of cats and dogs had suffered kidney failure and about 10 died after eating the affected pet food, the company said.",

                "The company, Menu Foods of Streetsville, Ontario, started testing its product on 40 to 50 animals on Feb. 27, one week after it began hearing from owners who said the food had made their pets ill, said Stephen Sundlof, director of the agency's Center for Veterinary Medicine.", 
                "The company alerted the FDA to its findings last week, and the agency has since opened a full investigation, Sundlof said.", 
                "All the animals that ultimately died had begun showing signs of kidney failure, the agency said.", 
                "In addition to those seven tested animals, at least three pets have died after eating contaminated food, Sundlof said, and the number is expected to rise as officials work to confirm the number of deaths.", 
                "Menu Foods manufactures products for brand-name companies including Eukanuba, Iams and Science Diet, as well as some store brands.", 
                "The full list is available from the company at www.menufoods.com/recall.", 
                "The FDA is focusing on contamination of wheat gluten, a protein used as filler in the foods' manufacture.", 
                "Menu Foods and Sundlof said the timing of the illnesses coincided with a point at which the company started using a new wheat gluten supplier.", 
                "Sundlof urged people who think their pet might have been affected to contact their local FDA office and a veterinarian if a pet exhibits symptoms of kidney failure, which include lethargy, loss of appetite and vomiting.", 
                "Cats are more likely than dogs to be affected, he said.", 
                "Around the country, worried pet owners inundated veterinarian's offices and pet stores with calls Monday, concerned that the food might have sickened their pets.", 
                "Marcella Nelson of Mattapoisett, Mass., changed her cat Tootsie's food to Iams after a checkup on Feb. 5, where her kidney function was tested and came back normal.", 
                "A week later she became lethargic and would not eat, and a test on Feb. 20 showed Tootsie was suffering from kidney failure and had to be euthanized.", 
                "Nelson did not throw out the food and said the product numbers matched those in the recall.", 
                "\"The only thing that changed between Feb. 3 and Feb. 20 was that she was put on Iams,\" Nelson said.", 
                "We thought we were doing a better thing for our cat, improving her food.",

                "Of the 10 cats and dogs whose deaths have been linked to pet food that was recalled over the weekend, seven died last month in a taste test conducted by the manufacturer, the Food and Drug Administration said Monday.", 
                "The company, Menu Foods of Streetsville, Ontario, started testing its product on 40 to 50 animals on Feb. 27, one week after it began hearing from owners who said the food had made their pets ill, said Stephen Sundlof, director of the agency's Center for Veterinary Medicine.", 
                "The company alerted the FDA to its findings last week, and the agency has since opened a full investigation, Sundlof said.", 
                "All the animals that ultimately died had begun showing signs of kidney failure, the agency said.", 
                "In addition to those seven tested animals, at least three pets have died after eating contaminated food, Sundlof said, and the number is expected to rise as officials work to confirm the number of deaths.",
