                "The statement would be sent to five international tuna conservation bodies, which would hold their first joint meeting in Kobe, Japan, Monday through Friday next week, the officials said.", 
                "The bodies are the Western Central Pacific Ocean Fisheries Commission, the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission, the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission, the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas and the Commission for the Conservation of the Southern Bluefin Tuna.", 
                "The statement also expressed concerns about \"the stock status of the world tuna resources being exploited close to, or over the level capable of producing the maximum sustainable yield\".", 
                "Japan eats a quarter of the world's tuna, more than any other country, but faces pressure from environmentalists, who have blamed the global fad for Japanese food for bringing tuna numbers to the brink of extinction.", 
                "An international commission in November reduced the world's gross catch of bluefin tuna in the Mediterranean from 32,000 tons this year to 29,500 tons for 2007, a move likely to lead to an import crunch in Japan.", 
                "Japan has also accepted a major cut in its quota for southern bluefin tuna in the Pacific Ocean as punishment for overfishing."

                "It is seen as a key step in combatting the downturn in one of the most valuable and endangered high seas fisheries.", 
                "Attendees, representing the commercial fishing industry as well as government regulators, will seek the creation of a framework requiring fishermen worldwide to produce certificates of origin for all species of tuna they catch, Kyodo News reported Sunday, citing a draft action plan for the meeting.", 
                "Doing so would help clamp down on excessive or illegal fishing, it said.", 
                "Requiring certificates of origin for all tuna would expand the conservation programs already under way in some regions, which cover certain threatened species such as bluefin tuna, Kyodo reported, without saying how it got the draft or who wrote it.", 
                "The draft also calls for a monitoring system that would track the tuna catch from the open sea to the fish market.", 
                "The recommendations echo those of the World Wildlife Fund, which released a position statement before the meeting calling for a \"global catch identification system,\" according to the Australian Associated Press.", 
                "This week's meeting is being hosted by Japan, one of the world's biggest tuna consumers and a frequent target of conservationists who accuse its fleets of overfishing.", 
                "The tuna talks will for the first time bring together the five so-called regional fishery management organizations, including the oversight bodies for tuna fishing in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans.", 
                "The discussions are also expected to focus on ways the regional groups can better share information.",

                "Overfishing and illegal fishing is often cited as the cause.", 
                "In October, the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna agreed at a meeting in Miyazaki, Japan, to reduce the global catch of the endangered southern bluefin tuna by more than 20 percent for 2007.", 
                "At that meeting, Japan also promised to halve its quota for the southern bluefin tuna as punishment for overfishing, but denied allegations it has poached thousands of tons of the endangered species every year.", 
                "Concern has been growing about overfishing of tuna and other fish species.", 
                "In November, a study in the journal Science warned that if current trends of overfishing and pollution continue, the populations of just about all seafood face collapse by 2048."

                "Participants are seeking to create a framework requiring fishermen -- not just exporters -- worldwide to produce certificates of origin for tuna they catch, and call for a monitoring system that would track the tuna catch from the open sea to the fish market, Sakamoto said.", 
                "This week's meeting is being hosted by Japan, one of the world's biggest tuna consumers and a frequent target of conservationists who accuse its fleets of overfishing.", 
                "The tuna talks will for the first time bring together the five regional fishery management organizations, including the oversight bodies for tuna fishing in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans.", 
                "\"Japan is a major fishing nation and consumer of tuna, and we would like to take a leadership so that we can establish a system that allows us stable and sustainable management of the valuable resource,\" Sakamoto said.", 
                "\"It would be much more efficient to establish a universal framework for tuna management.", 
                "\" By 2004, the number of adult Atlantic bluefin tuna capable of spawning had plummeted to roughly 19 percent of its 1975 level in the western half of the ocean, according to the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas.",

                "At that meeting, Japan also promised to halve its quota for the southern bluefin tuna as compensation for overfishing, but denied poaching allegations.", 
                "\"Tuna are fast disappearing, with important stocks at high risk of commercial extinction due to weak management,\" environmental group World Wide Fund For Nature said in a statement Monday.", 
                "\"Atlantic bluefin, used for high-end sushi and sashimi, is massively overfished and the spawning stock of Southern bluefin in the Indian Ocean is down about 90 percent."

                "Nothing highlights Japan's insatiable hunger for tuna like the fish aisle at a supermarket -- brick-size chucks of savory red meat, trays of delicately sliced sashimi and shelf-loads of sushi rolls.", 
                "Prized bluefin specimens the size of grown men, hooked as far away as the Mediterranean, are packed in ice and flown for next-day delivery to Tokyo, where they can fetch hundreds of dollars per pound (hundreds of euros per kilogram) at auction.", 
                "With soaring demand and prices to match, it's a small wonder that global tuna stocks are on the verge of collapse.", 
                "The new question is how long -- or if -- the binge can continue.", 
                "This week scientists, regulators and fishermen are trying to reverse the decline at an unprecedented global summit to save the silvery fish and one of the world's most valuable and endangered catches.", 
                "At stake is an annual global haul worth hundreds of millions of dollars (euros) and the preservation of a top-tier predator fish that helps hold the ocean ecosystem in balance.", 
                "The conference, which ends Friday in the western city of Kobe, is the first by the world's five regional tuna regulating bodies to form a global strategy.", 
                "\"Sustainable management of the world's tuna fisheries should be possible, if the will can be found,\" Simon Cripps, director of World Wildlife Fund's marine program, said in a statement Monday.", 
                "\"But many governments are routinely ignoring scientific advice, failing to implement the available conservation and management measures.", 
                "\" Some scientists believe that by 2030 there may be no mature tuna left among species like the southern bluefin if overfishing and poaching aren't addressed.", 
                "Japan's role as host to the Kobe conference is highly symbolic of its role as a major tuna consumer.", 
                "The country accounts for 12 percent of the global catch of 2.06 million tons.", 
                "Japan's fisheries agency says the country gobbles up a quarter of the world supply of the five big species: bluefin, southern bluefin, bigeye, yellowfin and albacore.", 
                "Representatives from the commercial fishing industry, environmental groups and government regulators are discussing ways to strengthen information sharing and cooperation among regional organizations to track and manage tuna stocks.", 
                "Participants are seeking to create a framework requiring fishermen -- not just exporters -- to produce certificates of origin for the tuna they catch.", 
                "The delegates also want to call for a monitoring system to track tuna from the open sea to the fish market.", 
                "That should help crack down on illegal fishing and countries that exceed quotas.", 
                "A global approach is seen as essential because tuna are highly migratory, journeying thousands of miles (kilometers) between feeding and spawning grounds.", 
                "Overfishing on one side of an ocean can affect fisheries half a world away.", 
                "By 2004, the number of adult Atlantic bluefin tuna capable of spawning had plummeted to roughly 19 percent of the 1975 level in the western half of the ocean, according to the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas.", 
                "Some action has already been taken.", 
                "In October, the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna agreed at a meeting in Miyazaki, Japan, to reduce the global catch of the endangered southern bluefin tuna by more than 20 percent in 2007.", 
                "At that meeting, Japan also promised to halve its quota for the southern bluefin tuna as compensation for overfishing, but denied poaching allegations.", 
                "But activists say overall quotas are still too high, and other challenges persist.", 
                "Tuna farms, for instance, are seen as one way of feeding global demand without depleting natural populations.", 
                "But conservationists warn that poaching has expanded to capture live tuna for delivery to such farms, where they are fattened for market.", 
                "At the Kobe meetings, Australia, Japan and the United States have also proposed a unified performance review of the five global tuna organizations to figure out which conservation techniques work.",
