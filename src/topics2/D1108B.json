                "But we are expecting less casualties this time because the government took early measures.",

                "Officials in both Bangladesh and across the border in India -- which is also expecting highly destructive winds and torrential rains -- have been racing to evacuate hundreds of thousands of people from the coast over the past 48 hours.", 
                "Karmakar said rivers in the Sunderbans area, a vast mangrove forest straddling the India-Bangladesh border and the natural habitat of endangered Royal Bengal tigers, were also swelling fast as the storm moved north in the direction of the capital Dhaka.", 
                "An official in Barisal, 120 kilometres south of Dhaka, spoke of severe destruction as the 500 kilometre-wide mass of cloud passed overhead.", 
                "\"Many trees have been uprooted and houses and schools blown away,\" Mostofa Kamal, a district relief and rehabilitation officer, told AFP by telephone.", 
                "\"The houses are made of only tin, bamboo and straw, which cannot withstand storms,\" explained another Bangladeshi district administrator, Mohammad Monjur-e-Elahi.", 
                "Much of Bangladesh's south and centre has bunkered down for the storm, with even the country's main sea port at Chittagong, to the east of the cyclone's path, also closed.", 
                "Officials in India's coastal state of West Bengal also reported destruction along India's part of the Sunderbans.", 
                "There were no immediate reports of casualties.", 
                "\"Mud huts have been damaged and the roofs of several houses blown off,\" said the state's relief minister, Mortaza Hossain.", 
                "\"The army has been put on alert, (and) more than 100,000 coastal villagers have been evacuated.", 
                "\" Authorities in India have been told to halt rail and other transportation in some areas due to the likelihood of heavy floods, said Ladu Ram Meena, deputy director of the weather centre for India's eastern region.", 
                "He said large-scale damage to power and communication lines was also expected.", 
                "Cyclone Sidr is expected to totally fizzle out on Saturday over India's northeast, and just south of the mountain kingdom of Bhutan.", 
                "Disaster prone Bangladesh's worst cyclone disaster was in 1970, when some half a million people died."
