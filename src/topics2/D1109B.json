                "\"The two departed from Gaza, and then they went to the liberated areas called 'area A', then to the territories occupied by Israel in 1948,\" Abu al-Waleed told a news conference held in Gaza City without explanation of \"area A.", 
                "\" However, \"area A\" usually describes the areas under the control of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) in the West Bank, which means the bombers did not get to Israel through Egypt.", 
                "Two Palestinian suicide bombers attempted to carry out a twin bombing attack in a busy commercial center of southern Israeli town of Dimona.", 
                "The first bomber successfully detonated his explosive belt in the commercial center, killing an Israeli woman and wounding 10 others, while the second was shot dead by Israeli police before he could set off his explosive device.", 
                "The spokesman on behalf of his group claimed the responsibility for the attack, saying \"This operation is carried out in the frame of retaliation to the ongoing Israeli aggression against the Palestinian people in the West Bank and Gaza.", 
                "\" However, al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades is not the only Palestinian group which claim the attack while two other groups, Abu Ali Mustafa of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and a previously unknown group named itself as Brigades of National Resistance, also claimed the responsibility.", 
                "Two weeks ago, Hamas militants in Gaza blew holes in the border wall between Gaza and Egypt, allowing hundreds of thousands of Gazans flocked into Egypt.", 
                "As the border fence between Gaza and Egypt had been porous before Egyptian border guards finally sealed off the breached border fence on Sunday, speculations were aroused in the wake of the attack within Israel on that the two bombers might sneak into Israel through Egypt."
