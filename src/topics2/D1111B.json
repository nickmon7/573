                "A teenager at a school in Finland went on the rampage Wednesday, shooting dead seven classmates and the headmistress, having first signalled his intentions in a video posted on the YouTube Internet site.", 
                "Police identified the killer as 18-year-old Pekka-Eric Auvinen, who died from his injuries late Wednesday after shooting himself in the head following the massacre at Jokela High School in the small town of Tuusula.", 
                "Witnesses described chaos and panic as Auvinen killed his headmistress, five boys, two girls, and wounded a dozen others as they tried to flee the carnage.", 
                "\"We heard the shots and then we broke the windows and jumped out,\" said Franz Andersin, a 14-year-old student who was in the school when the shooting spree started.", 
                "\"I knew the guy.", 
                "He was always smiling.", 
                "I wonder why he did it,\" he told AFP.", 
                "Finnish Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen described the shooting, the worst in the Nordic country's history, as \"a great tragedy.", 
                "\" \"This is an awful day ...", 
                "The shooting has deeply undermined the sense of security in society ... Nobody had expected such things,\" Vanhanen said.", 
                "The rampage, which began at 11:43 am (0943 GMT) inside a classroom at the secondary school of some 450 pupils, came after Auvinen posted a video entitled \"Jokela High School Massacre -- 11/7/2007\" on file-sharing website YouTube.", 
                "The video, posted sometime in the past two weeks, zooms in on the school with heavy metal music blaring in the background and shows a young man against a red background pointing a gun at the camera.", 
                "Within hours of the shooting, the video had been downloaded more than 200,000 times.", 
                "In his profile on YouTube, Auvinen, calling himself Sturmgeist89, says: \"I am prepared to fight and die for my cause.", 
                "\"I, as a natural selector, will eliminate all who I see unfit, disgraces of human race and failures of natural selection.", 
                "\" \"You might ask yourselves, why did I do this and what do I want.", 
                "Well, most of you are too arrogant and closed-minded to understand,\" he added.", 
                "He was pronounced dead at 2214 local time (2014 GMT) after being treated for a single gunshot wound to the head at Helsinki University Hospital.", 
                "\"He died at 2214 of a one-bullet injury in the head,\" doctor Eero Hirvensalochief, traumatology physician at the hospital, told AFP.", 
                "Police and school pupils alike were at a loss to explain why Auvinen had committed such a terrible act.", 
                "\"He comes from a very normal family, four people, he has one brother.", 
                "He had no problems in school,\" said local police officer Jan-Olav Nyholm naming Auvinen for the first time.", 
                "Another of Auvinen's classmates, meanwhile, told the Helsingin Sanomat newspaper that the gunman, who was a sports shooter, had recently been acting \"strange\" and had begun making drawings of gun massacres.", 
                "He had logged into his YouTube account on Wednesday morning.", 
                "Other videos posted under his name hail the perpetrators of school shootings in the United States and Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh.", 
                "According to media reports, he had repeatedly expressed admiration for Hitler and Stalin and he names Nietzsche as a favourite author on his YouTube account.", 
                "The American-style shooting sent shockwaves through Finland, where such violence is extremely rare.", 
                "While there have been several stabbings at Finnish schools in recent years, Wednesday's was the first shooting since a 14-year-old shot dead two classmates in a school in the coastal city of Rauma in 1989.", 
                "\"It's incredible that something like this has happened in Finland,\" said Jokela high school history and psychology professor Kim Kiuru.", 
                "Finland has one of the world's highest gun ownership rates, ranking third behind the United States and Yemen according to a recent study by Small Arms Survey by the Graduate Institute of International Studies in Geneva.", 
                "Most of the registered weapons in Finland are hunting rifles."

                "Flags flew at half mast across the Nordic country a day after 18-year-old Pekka- Eric Auvinen went on his shooting spree at Jokela High School in Tuusula -- a small, picturesque town of just 30,000 inhabitants on the banks of a lake north of Helsinki.", 
                "Auvinen, a broad-shouldered, blond-haired youth described by police as \"a lonely person with a strong anger against society and radical thoughts,\" walked through the school late Wednesday morning, peppering hallways and classrooms with 69 bullets.", 
                "When his 20-minute shooting rampage was over, five boys aged between 16 and 18, the 61-year-old headmistress, a 42-year-old female nurse and a 25-year-old single mother taking an adult training class at the school were dead, all of them with multiple gun shot wounds to the head and upper body.", 
                "The twelve people injured in the attack, most of them suffering cuts from broken window panes as they frantically jumped out of windows to escape the rain of bullets, had been released from hospital.", 
                "Police, who gave no details on the order in which the victims had been shot, said Auvinen had also tried to set a second floor corridor on fire using an unidentified inflammable liquid before shooting himself in the head in a bathroom near the school cafeteria.", 
                "Auvinen, who died of his wounds late Wednesday, was carrying 320 more bullets when he was found, according to police, who found no other weapons in his home.", 
                "\"From the first indication we have, he shot randomly, but this kind of thing is under investigation still,\" police officer Jan Olof Nyholm told a press conference, adding that the gunman had carried out his deadly rampage alone.", 
                "Auvinen, described as an adherent of extreme philosophies on both the left and the right, had posted a notice on website YouTube before the attack detailing how he would carry out the massacre as well as a video entitled \"Jokela High School Massacre -- 11/7/2007\".", 
                "\"I don't want this to be called only as 'school shooting',\" he said of the massacre, which appears to have been planned to coincide with the anniversary of the Bolshevik revolution.", 
                "In the \"attack information\", he clearly detailed his intentions.", 
                "\"Target: Jokela High School, students and faculty, society, humanity, human race ...", 
                "Attack type: mass murder, political terrorism.", 
                "\" \"Although I choosed (sic) the school as target, my motives for the attack are political and much, much deeper and therefore I don't want this to be called only as 'school shooting',\" he added in the message which was rapidly removed from the sight after attack.", 
                "Several of the 18-year-old's classmates and teachers described a brilliant but complex loner obsessed with weapons, Internet war games and revolutionary history who was often bullied and tormented.", 
                "Students said the perpetrator of one of the worst tragedies in recent Finnish history had made no secret of his admiration for Hitler and Stalin and had been taking anti-depressant medications, something police refused to comment on.", 
                "Auvinen left a suicide note for his family that had been handed over to police.", 
                "\"It was a kind of goodbye letter to the relatives,\" Nyholm said, adding that the boy's family had been placed under police protection because of threats.", 
                "The shooting sent shockwaves through Finland, which with its mere 5.3 million inhabitants and low crime rates, is unaccustomed to such violence.", 
                "\"Tuusula will have lifelong scars,\" mayor Hannu Joensivu told the FNB news agency."
