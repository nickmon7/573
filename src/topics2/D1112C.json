                "\" Metrolink is fighting on the grounds that the federal government certified the push-pull method as safe, and it still uses the push-pull method on all trains.", 
                "In 2006, a Federal Railroad Administration report found there was not enough evidence to justify always having a locomotive out front, and Metrolink says it would be too impractical and expensive.", 
                "The money from the lawsuit, many plaintiffs agree, is secondary.", 
                "They want Metrolink to stop pushing trains and to install better security measures around crossings.", 
                "\"For some families, it's like it happened yesterday -- especially for the young mothers and widows,\" said Clark Aristei, an attorney for the plaintiffs.", 
                "\"For the injured people, even though it's three years later, some can get nervous just seeing a train on TV.", 
                "It's the subtle things that re-stimulate the terror -- these people just can't escape them for the rest of their lives.", 
                "\" In the years leading up to the crash, Thomas Ormiston, who drove Amtrak and Metrolink trains, grew more and more uncomfortable riding in the front car when the train was being pushed from behind.", 
                "He called it the \"coffin car.", 
                "\" On the day of the crash, the veteran conductor was in what he thought was the safer locomotive of Train 901.", 
                "But when Train 100 derailed, it slammed into him, and he was killed.", 
                "The 58-year-old Northridge man's widow, Ann, said the anniversary is tough every year.", 
                "\"It's almost like I build up to it, I'm fine, I manage to get through the holidays,\" she said.", 
                "\"And it's like this doom and gloom over my head for the rest of January.", 
                "\" For Elaine Siebers-Parent and her brother, Bob, it's the sound of the train whistle in the night that haunts them.", 
                "Their brother, Billy, was on the way to his job as a clerk with the Los Angeles Unified School District.", 
                "Billy Parent, a bachelor who lived alone in Canoga Park, was 53, a few years away from retirement.", 
                "He wanted to open a nursery and spend his spare time fishing in Mammoth with Bob.", 
                "Instead of baiting hooks, Bob Parent is preparing for the emotional experience of hearing the events unfold once again in court.", 
                "\"It brings back bad memories, but we have to have some kind of closure,\" he said.", 
                "\"I want to see the criminal trial take place.", 
                "Yes, Mr. Alvarez was involved, but Metrolink isn't admitting any guilt.", 
                "In my opinion, they're the ones who are really responsible.", 
                "\" He and his sister are willing to reopen the old wounds in the hope it will bring change.", 
                "Saturday morning, they plan to visit the memorial erected last year by the Atwater Village Neighborhood Council.", 
                "Christine Anthony, who lived a block away from the crash, worked two years to get the memorial erected, then spent most of this year getting it beautified.", 
                "She wanted something permanent, something that would remind people of the terrible day.", 
                "\"It really touched a lot of people's lives,\" she said.", 
                "\"It reached out like a spider web.", 
                "\" A spider web that still ensnares Elaine Siebers-Parent.", 
                "When the crash killed her brother, it took away the family historian.", 
                "Each night, she still has the urge to call him up to see what's new.", 
                "\"It feels like it happened yesterday,\" she said.", 
                "\"I feel like time has not moved on.", 
                "Justice has not been served -- yet."

                "For the engineer of Metrolink 100, the horror of Jan. 26, 2005, came seconds after he noticed an odd reflection on the tracks, about a quarter mile dead ahead.", 
                "As his train with three passenger cars zoomed straight for the reflection at nearly 80 mph, he soon realized it was coming from an SUV straddling the tracks.", 
                "\"He ran down the aisle and told people to 'Hold on!", 
                "\"' Deputy District Attorney John Monaghan told jurors Monday in opening remarks at the trial for the Metrolink train crash in Glendale, in which 11 passengers and crew died.", 
                "About 180 other people were injured.", 
                "Prosecutors portrayed Juan Manuel Alvarez, the man accused of murder, as an egomaniac meth user who wanted to kill people as a way to get attention from his estranged wife.", 
                "Playing a slide show featuring photos of the victims when they were alive, followed by shots of their bodies in the wreckage, Los Angeles County prosecutors said there is no doubt that Alvarez is guilty of murder for dousing his SUV with gasoline, leaving it on railroad tracks in Glendale and watching the carnage unfold.", 
                "\"On that day, Mr. Alvarez murdered 11 people,\" Monaghan said.", 
                "The defense argued that Alvarez's only intent that morning was to kill himself.", 
                "While he's responsible for setting off a \"perfect storm\" of escalating events that resulted in the death of 11 people, that doesn't make him a murderer, said Thomas Kielty, Alvarez's defense lawyer.", 
                "\"Juan Alvarez was looking for a place to light himself on fire,\" said Kielty about the reason Alvarez initially drove his Jeep south, well past the legal traffic barrier at the train crossing at Chevy Chase Drive, between Los Angeles and Glendale.", 
                "He then decided that getting hit by a train would be a more efficient way to kill himself, his attorney said.", 
                "\"Juan Alvarez never imagined that a train would derail or that anybody would die other than himself,\" Kielty said.", 
                "Alvarez, 29, with shorter hair and a goatee, wore a cream-color suit at the opening of his trial.", 
                "He is charged with 11 counts of murder and one count of arson and train wrecking, along with special-circumstance allegations of multiple murders and train wrecking stemming from the crash.", 
                "About 6 a.m. on Jan. 26, 2005, Metrolink train 100, heading southbound, smashed into Alvarez's SUV before derailing and hitting two more trains, including the northbound Metrolink 901.", 
                "\"Don't let me burn!", 
                "don't let me burn!", 
                "\" Monaghan said passengers on board the trains screamed in the fiery aftermath.", 
                "\"The evidence will clearly show beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Alvarez is the individual that parked a jeep that had been doused with gasoline on the southbound tracks.", 
                "\" Alvarez's methamphetamine use was so bad and he was so delusional that he thought the CIA was following him and that his wife had a slew of lovers, including one who secretly slept with the couple in their bed, prompting Alvarez to sleep with a knife, Kielty said.", 
                "After a series of incidents and suicide or \"pretend-suicide\" attempts, as the prosecutors called them -- such as when Alvarez inflicted wounds on himself or took pills -- his wife kicked him out of their home.", 
                "She got a restraining order in late 2004 to keep him away from her, their children, as well as his mother and brother, whom Alvarez allegedly threatened to kill.", 
                "The defense contends that after hearing the voices of his estranged wife and \"her lover\" calling him stupid, coming from the back seat of his dark-green Jeep Cherokee, Alvarez, who was on his way to work at about 5:30 a.m., decided to kill himself.", 
                "He filled up two water bottles with gasoline and went to look for a place to light himself on fire.", 
                "But prosecutors said they believe the evidence will show that Alvarez didn't intend to kill himself, just others.", 
                "\"Mr. Alvarez used Metrolink 100 as a match to light his vehicle on fire,\" Monaghan said.", 
                "Cathryn Brogham, deputy district attorney, said Alvarez's actions that day were part of a consistent pattern in which he tried to get his estranged wife's attention, this time by killing people.", 
                "\"He could have simply walked in front of that train,\" Brogham said.", 
                "\"He didn't just go jump off a bridge.", 
                "He did not go drive his vehicle off a mountain.", 
                "\" The defense claims that Alvarez changed his mind about the suicide and tried unsuccessfully to back the jeep off the tracks, but the vehicle was stuck.", 
                "For Henry Romero, whose uncle Leonardo Romero was killed in the crash, there's nothing the defense can say to convince him of Alvarez's innocence.", 
                "\"Blatant murder is what I think it is,\" Romero said.", 
                "The family is involved in a lawsuit against the Metrolink, saying that the push method used to propel the Metrolink 100 -- where the engine is behind the passenger cars -- was unsafe.", 
                "Metrolink is fighting the suit on the grounds that the federal government certified the push-pull method as safe.", 
                "And in 2006, a Federal Railroad Administration report found there was not enough evidence to justify always having a locomotive out front, and Metrolink says it would be impractical and expensive."

                "LOS ANGELES - The man who caused the 2005 Metrolink train derailment that left 11 dead was \"violent\" and \"dangerous\" and considered killing people in the days leading up to the crash, he said Wednesday during cross-examination in his murder trial.", 
                "Deputy District Attorney John Monaghan pounded Juan Manuel Alvarez for details about threats he admitted making to kill or injure his then-estranged wife, his cousin and others before he parked his SUV on railroad tracks in Glendale, causing the Jan. 26, 2005, collision.", 
                "\"So you were mad,\" Monaghan said.", 
                "\"So you said you were going to kill somebody, is that what you're telling this jury?", 
                "\" Alvarez shot back that it appeared that Monaghan was trying to say he intended to kill people on the train, which he denies.", 
                "Alvarez, 29, faces 11 counts of murder, one count each of train wrecking and arson, as well as special-circumstance allegations of multiple murder and train wrecking.", 
                "If convicted, he could face the death penalty.", 
                "The prosecution's cross-examination is scheduled to continue this morning.", 
                "During his second day of testimony in Los Angeles Superior Court, Alvarez said he was in good spirits when he woke up that January morning, even taking time to water his landlord's roses before driving off for a meeting about a job.", 
                "Alvarez was an admitted methamphetamine user at the time of the crash, although he testified that it had been three or four days since he had used the drug, even though he initially told a doctor it had been longer because he was ashamed and afraid it would make him look bad.", 
                "That morning, Alvarez, a man who defense witnesses have testified hallucinated that his wife's phantom lover slept in their bed and could fly, thought his wife and her lover were in the back seat of his vehicle, mocking him.", 
                "Under earlier questioning Tuesday from defense attorney Thomas Kielty, Alvarez said that's when he decided to douse himself with gasoline and kill himself.", 
                "He said he ditched that plan because he thought it would be \"too painful,\" and decided to kill himself by parking his SUV on the train tracks instead.", 
                "But he changed his mind again, he testified Tuesday, and wanted to live for his children, but couldn't get the stuck SUV off the tracks.", 
                "Wednesday, he admitted to Monaghan that he has repeatedly lied to people, and the prosecutor noted that in recent months, Alvarez told a doctor he thought that January morning about killing his wife at work \"and everybody else.", 
                "\" \"I probably meant everybody else that was spying on me, the people that were following me,\" he said.", 
                "The day began with Kielty continuing his direct examination, in which Alvarez admitted that while in custody, he has illegally stored razor blades, sold prescription medicine and made a batch of \"pruno\" -- a homemade alcoholic brew.", 
                "Alvarez also admitted passing a friend heroin that had been smuggled in by a new inmate, as well as using extortion and threats against another inmate, a man he said was in custody for child molestation.", 
                "In his questioning, Kielty pointed out that Alvarez had been recorded in jail saying he was drug-free and didn't intend on using drugs, in part, because they caused him to hallucinate and \"get crazy.", 
                "\" \"I think I'm better now and I'm afraid to take anything,\" Alvarez said.", 
                "But just Wednesday morning, Alvarez took anti-depression medication, he admitted under cross-examination.", 
                "And Monaghan highlighted Alvarez's jailhouse problems as proof that he hasn't changed, quoting from a recorded phone conversation in which Alvarez told someone he extorted two $10.75 phone cards and a bag of coffee from another inmate under threats of harm.", 
                "\"Didn't you tell this inmate if he didn't pay you, he would get 'f----- up,'?", 
                "\"Are you still dangerous?", 
                "\" Alvarez's response: \"I don't consider myself dangerous."

                "Having recently won a murder conviction for Juan Manuel Alvarez in Glendale's 2005 Metrolink train disaster, prosecutors kicked off their arguments Monday trying to persuade jurors to sentence the Compton handyman to death.", 
                "After watching gruesome photos and hearing emotional testimony from loved ones of the victims, some jurors were brought to tears as the prosecution pushed its case forward.", 
                "\"Life without parole is not justice for the 11 victims,\" Deputy District Attorney Cathryn Brougham told the nine women and three men who will decide Alvarez's fate.", 
                "As prosecutors continued, the jury could hear the sobs and wails of relatives of Leonardo Romero of Newport Beach.", 
                "Romero, 53, was one of the 11 killed when Alvarez drove his SUV onto the tracks in Glendale on Jan. 26, 2005, causing a disaster in which a Metrolink train derailed and smashed into another commuter train.", 
                "When prosecutors showed a photograph of Romero -- a former Marine and father of three, taken shortly after his death -- the family was overcome with emotion.", 
                "One juror wiped tears streaming down her cheeks with a tissue and calmed herself by cooling her face with an Asian-style fan.", 
                "Alvarez, 29, sitting dispassionately next to his attorneys, looked at the witnesses during their testimony and occasionally glanced at the photographs that prosecutors displayed on a large screen hanging from a wall in the courtroom.", 
                "The jury appeared equally moved later when prosecutors presented their first two witnesses -- the mother and younger brother of James Tutino, 47, a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy who was among the victims.", 
                "Maureen Tutino narrated a slide show of her family's photographs that prosecutor John Monaghan presented to jurors, showing the central role James Tutino had occupied in the lives of his loved ones and the void his death had created.", 
                "\"He was kind of the sunshine of our life,\" said an emotionally wrought Maureen Tutino, \"and we miss that.", 
                "\" Tutino said one of James' sons, Nick, will be sworn in as a sheriff's deputy July 17 and will be given his father's badge number.", 
                "Tony Tutino, who followed his brother's footsteps into law enforcement, recounted the draining ordeal of learning of James' death -- and then the most difficult part: never being \"able to go say goodbye to my brother.", 
                "\" \"Because of the injuries he suffered, I had to say my goodbyes through a coffin, and that's the most difficult thing for me.", 
                "I'll regret that for the rest of my life.", 
                "\" Later in the penalty phase of the trial, Alvarez's wife, Carmen, and his brother Beto are expected to ask jurors to spare his life.", 
                "The jury is not expected to reach a verdict on whether to recommend life in prison or death for Alvarez until at least late next week.", 
                "Alvarez was convicted June 26 of 11 counts of first-degree murder and one count of arson.", 
                "The jury also found true the special circumstance of multiple murders, which makes Alvarez eligible for the death penalty.", 
                "The train derailment also injured 180 people.", 
                "Prosecutors want the jury to recommend that Alvarez be executed instead of spending the rest of his life in prison without the possibility of parole.", 
                "\"Life without parole is not an adequate, appropriate punishment,\" Brougham told jurors.", 
                "\"The defendant deserves the greater punishment.", 
                "\" In her closing argument, Brougham presented profiles of each of the 11 people who died, saying family members and friends would attest to the loss and tragedy caused by their deaths.", 
                "\"You can only begin to imagine the damage that this man has caused,\" Brougham said of the victims.", 
                "\"Each was a unique individual with a future, with a family, with hopes, with dreams.", 
                "\" Alvarez's attorneys deferred their argument until they begin presenting the defense case, possibly later this week.", 
                "In addition to Alvarez family members, defense attorneys are expected to elicit testimony from psychiatrists in an attempt to portray the convicted killer in the sympathetic light of a troubled man who was abused as a child by his father and uncle.", 
                "Possibly preparing for that, prosecutors reminded jurors that Alvarez's brother and sister had also been abused as children, but that they, like most children who have been abused, did not wind up as mass murderers.", 
                "\"He told you himself he had homicidal thoughts that morning,\" Brougham reminded jurors about Alvarez's testimony.", 
                "\"It's not an accident that these people were murdered by him.", 
                "\" Alvarez, according to Brougham, had acted as a man bent on destruction with no sense of conscience about the havoc he would cause.", 
                "Brougham also reminded jurors of testimony that while in jail, Alvarez had dealt drugs, intimidated prisoners and engaged in other behavior inconsistent with a person truly sorry for his actions.", 
                "\"That is not a remorseful, regretful person,\" she said.", 
                "\"Every time the defense asks you for mercy, think of his conduct in jail.", 
                "Think of the real Juan Alvarez."

                "Relatives of the man convicted of murdering 11 Metrolink passengers in a Glendale train derailment said Thursday that he was the product of a violent family that exposed him to incest, rape, substance abuse and drug trafficking over two generations.", 
                "Juan Manuel Alvarez's mother, Leticia Ayala, told a jury that he was an unwanted pregnancy and that she had tried, but failed, to abort her unborn son using folk-medicine brews of herbs and leaves as well as traditional medications.", 
                "The nine women and three men on the jury will decide whether the 29-year-old Compton handyman will get the death penalty or spend the rest of his life in prison.", 
                "The testimony of family members came on the first day of closing arguments for Alvarez's defense team.", 
                "The sentencing phase of the trial follows his conviction last month on 11 counts of first- degree murder.", 
                "\"Before you sentence the man, you take into account not just the offense, you take into account the man,\" court-appointed lead defense lawyer Michael Belter told jurors at the outset of his closing argument.", 
                "Jurors did not seem as moved emotionally as they were during the prosecution's presentation of testimony from family and friends of the victims of the Jan. 26, 2005, Metrolink train derailment.", 
                "But they were visibly gripped by the accounts of sexual molestation, beatings, emotional abuse and abject family life described by the defense and family members.", 
                "Belter asked jurors to recommend life in prison without the possibility of parole for Alvarez, while acknowledging the gravity of his client's deadly actions that irrevocably devastated the victims' families.", 
                "\"We are not here to offer any excuses or justifications,\" he said.", 
                "The testimony given Thursday presented a tragic family from the border town of Mexicali, where the seeds of Alvarez's violence can be traced.", 
                "There, the Juan Alvarez Sr. family carried out unspeakable acts of extreme machismo and dominance over loved ones.", 
                "From the time he was a child, Alvarez was mercilessly beaten for no apparent reason by his father, using fists, belts and electrical cords, several relatives testified.", 
                "As children, Alvarez, his sister and others in the family were sexually molested by an uncle, relatives said on the witness stand.",

                "The life-or-death decision about the fate of a man convicted of murdering 11 people by causing a commuter train derailment in 2005 was placed in the hands of jurors after his lawyer told them: \"You are not here to be avenging angels.", 
                "You are here to be a rational and thinking body.", 
                "\" The same panel that found Juan Alvarez guilty of 11 counts of first-degree murder was asked Monday to recommend whether he be put to death or sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.", 
                "Alvarez parked his sport utility vehicle on railroad tracks, causing a Metrolink train to derail and strike another Metrolink train going the other direction on Jan. 26, 2005.", 
                "Eleven people died and about 180 were injured.", 
                "In closing arguments of the death penalty phase of his trial, a prosecutor asked for the death sentence, depicting the 29-year-old Alvarez as a selfish man who turned his back on every opportunity offered to him when he came to the United States after a childhood in Mexico.", 
                "\"He had a lot going for him.", 
                "He basically had the American dream,\" said Deputy District Attorney John Monaghan.", 
                "\"He feels he has a right to do whatever he wants to do,\" the prosecutor said.", 
                "Monaghan said that Alvarez ripped apart the lives of families whose loved ones were killed in the derailment and that he had forefeited his right to live.", 
                "Defense attorney Michael Belter argued that Alvarez's childhood of abuse by a father who was a \"monster\" and a mother who tried to abort him shaped him into a mentally disturbed man who sought refuge in methamphetamine addiction.", 
                "\"To suggest he is anything but a troubled person with deep-seated mental illness is to ignore the obvious,\" Belter said.", 
                "\"From the moment he was conceived he was unwanted and unloved.", 
                "\" He reminded jurors of testimony that Alvarez was beaten relentlessly by his father, that he tried to commit suicide when he was just a child and that he saw his pregnant mother beaten until she had a miscarriage.", 
                "\"This leads to lifelong depression,\" Belter said, citing Alvarez's testimony that he was hearing voices in the weeks before the derailment and that he set out to kill himself that day, not to kill others.", 
                "\"Mr. Alvarez did not intend to kill,\" Belter said.", 
                "\"That was not in his heart that day.", 
                "He did not plan his life with a design to kill and ruin all these lives.", 
                "\" He acknowledged the power of testimony from survivors of those killed and said, \"There is nothing I can say that would alleviate the tremendous pain and suffering, the loss by these families.", 
                "\" But he added, \"You are here to make a rational decision, not be swayed by emotion.", 
                "\" Of Alvarez, he said, \"He is a man for whom death is not warranted.",
