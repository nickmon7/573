                "Findings from the University of California San Francisco will not immediately change the way patients with symptoms of heart trouble are assessed, but may eventually play a key role in guiding doctors to treatment decisions.", 
                "\"Our goal is to determine who are the high risk patients, so we can target medical and surgical therapies we know to be life-saving to those most likely to benefit,\" said Dr. Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo, whose research was published in today's issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association.",

                "Common heart disease drug therapies such as ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, and diuretics can decrease the levels, making BNP and NT-proBNP effective markers for cardiac conditions.",

                "After four years they found that the higher the level of the peptide in the blood at the outset, the higher their chances were for having an adverse cardiac event.", 
                "For example, patients whose heart peptide levels put them in the top quarter of those tested, had a nearly 8-fold increased rate of cardiovascular events or death compared with those whose peptide levels were lowest.",

                "\"That is a surprise.",

                "The heart peptide test might help decide, for example, whether a patient needs coronary artery bypass surgery, considered a highly effective, but risky approach to cardiovascular disease.", 
                "\"This might be a way to help inform the discussion between a doctor and patient about whether their risk of developing another heart attack or failure in the future is so high that they are willing to undergo an intervention like a bypass surgery,\" she said."

                "Congenital heart disease (CHD) has become more prevalent among adults as well as children, according to a latest study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association.", 
                "Severe CHD has risen in adults by 85 percent and 22 percent in children during the 15-year study (1985-2000), the study said.", 
                "\"This is the first study to measure the changing number of patients in a North American population during a period of major progress in the management of CHD,\" said Ariane J. Marelli, M.D., lead author of the study and director of the McGill Adult Unit for Congenital Heart Disease Excellence at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.", 
                "\"CHD has been thought of as a disease of childhood, but it has become an important disease of adulthood as well,\" Marelli said.", 
                "The study measured prevalence, age and proportion of adults relative to children at four time points: 1985, 1990, 1995 and 2000, and analyzed the Quebec administrative databases recorded for the general population where access to health care is universal.", 
                "Quebec accounts for 25 percent of Canada's population.", 
                "\"This is the largest population study of CHD to have been performed in North America,\" Marelli said.", 
                "\"There is no reason to believe that the predominantly Caucasian population of Quebec and Canada is different from the United States.", 
                "\" Extrapolating the study findings to the U.S. population, Marelli estimated 1.8 million Americans had CHD in 2000 and that this number is increasing and will have implications for women, pregnancy and genetics.", 
                "She estimated about 900,000 adults and 900,000 children had CHD.", 
                "In 2000, the study indicated that one of every 85 children had CHD and one of 250 adults had CHD.", 
                "\"For comparison purposes, cystic fibrosis occurs in one of 4,500 live births, so there are 45 times more children with CHD than children with cystic fibrosis and most of these children are nowbecoming adults,\" Marelli said.", 
                "Furthermore, more adults have had CHD than children since 1985, and a preponderance are women, the study found.", 
                "\"Between 1985 and 2000, the group of patients that rose the most rapidly were adults with severe CHD, so, as of 2000, there was a nearly equal number of children and adults with severe CHD,\" Marelli said The most significant increases in CHD were in adolescents (13 to 17 years old) and in young adults (18 to 25), according to the study.", 
                "The median age of those with severe CHD increased markedly from 1985 to 2000.", 
                "The median age in 1985 was 11 years compared to 17 years in 2000.", 
                "Congenital heart defects are structural problems arising from abnormal formation of the heart or major blood vessels near the heart that occurs before birth.", 
                "Most heart defects either obstruct blood flow in the heart or vessels near it, or cause blood to flow through the heart in an abnormal way.", 
                "Marelli considers CHD a major public health problem in North America that is largely under-recognized.", 
                "\"We need to increase public awareness for congenital heart disease in order to be able to better care for the increasing number of young people with heart disease,\" Marelli said."

                "The gradual erosion of telomeres, the strands of DNA capping chromosomes that wear away with each cell division, may play a pivotal role in heart disease, and drugs called statins may limit the damage, the New Scientist reported on Friday on its website.", 
                "Researchers from Leicester and Glasgow Universities in the United Kingdom found that people who have much shorter telomeres are more likely to suffer from heart attacks.", 
                "In the five-year research, they first took blood samples from 484 middle-aged men with moderately raised cholesterol and from 1058 control subjects, and compared the telomere lengths in their white blood cells.", 
                "The researchers eventually found both patients and controls with the shortest telomeres were twice as likely to have developed serious heart disease, They also found that statins, which are better known for their cholesterol- lowering properties, appeared to alleviate the effects of telomere damage and may even protect telomeres against degradation.", 
                "But the protective effect of statins was only seen in patients with comparatively short telomeres.", 
                "\"In patients whose telomeres were wearing away at a normal rate, statin treatment didn't make any difference.", 
                "This suggests that statins were protecting against the worst cases of telomere degradation.", 
                "Without statins they might have been even shorter,\" Leicester University cardiologist Nilesh Samani, who led the research, was quoted as saying.", 
                "For years, doctors and scientists have suspected that another property of statins, unrelated to their cholesterol-lowering ability, explained how they protected patients from heart disease and stroke so effectively.", 
                "The discoveries made by Samani's team provide important new insights into the causes of arterial disease.", 
                "Samani said exactly how statins might limit the damage caused by telomere shortening or even directly protect telomeres was \" speculation at this stage,\" but his group has already begun laboratory studies to test how the drugs interact with telomeres."

                "For the study, Dominique S. Michaud of the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston and colleagues analyzed data from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, which has gathered data about a wide range of health issues from 51,529 American men.", 
                "After taking other factors into consideration, such as age, smoking, diabetes and body mass index, the researchers found that the men with gum disease were 63 percent more likely to develop pancreatic cancer than those without gum disease.",
