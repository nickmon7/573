                "Authorities battled to contain the oil inside a boom some eight kilometres (five miles) long to prevent it damaging the coastline, as a fleet of 28 ships scattered dispersant chemicals or tried to pump up the spillage.",

                "\"We have set up a boom, trying to stop oil from spreading along the coast, but oil sometimes overflows it depending on the currents.", 
                "\" The Hong Kong-registered tanker Hebei Spirit, carrying about 15,000 tons of oil, was berthed five miles off Mallipo, 90 kilometres (54 miles) southwest of Seoul, when it was pierced in three places.", 
                "The ministry said the spillage might be greater than the estimated 10,000 tons.", 
                "It said operations had been hampered by strong winds and the danger of an explosion.", 
                "Three small tankers were sent to pump the remaining oil from the single-hull tanker.",

                "\"Our initial investigation showed loose ropes linked to the towing vessel might have caused the accident,\" Kim told AFP.", 
                "Yonhap news agency said the tow rope broke in strong winds and high waves.", 
                "The spill triggered an emergency operation by about 40 coastguard and other ships as well as four helicopters, said maritime ministry officials who have set up a crisis centre.", 
                "The ministry said dozens of vessels in other regions had been asked to join the operation.", 
                "The tanker was anchored near waters designated as a national park before sailing into Daesan port to discharge its cargo.", 
                "The west coast is one of Asia's largest wetland areas.", 
                "In the previous worst incident in South Korea, a tanker hit a rock in 1995 and spilt 5,000 tones of oil onto the south coast, causing damage estimated at 44.3-billion won (48-million dollars).", 
                "In addition, the government spent more than 22-billion won on a five-month operation to clean up the south coast."

                "A crane-carrying vessel slammed into a Hong Kong-registered oil tanker in seas off South Korea's west coast Friday, causing the tanker to leak about 66,000 barrels of crude oil, officials said.", 
                "The collision at around 7:30 a.m. (2230 GMT Thursday) left holes in three containers aboard the 146,000-ton tanker Hebei Spirit, leading to what was believed to be South Korea's largest offshore oil leak, a Maritime and Fisheries Ministry official said on customary condition of anonymity, citing office policy.", 
                "The spill released about 66,000 barrels (10.5 million liters; 2.7 million gallons), said Coast Guard officer Jung Se-hi.", 
                "Earlier, ministry officials had cited a larger figure of about 110,000 barrels for the spill.", 
                "The leakage was stopped by late afternoon and work was concentrated on cleaning up the spill, Jung said.", 
                "The Coast Guard dispatched 34 coast guard, navy and other government vessels as well as four helicopters to stop the spread of the spill and collect the oil, Jung said.", 
                "YTN, a 24-hour cable news channel, showed footage of the black oil gushing out of the ship and into the ocean.", 
                "There were no human casualties in the accident.", 
                "The tanker was at anchor about 8 kilometers (5 miles) off Mallipo beach, about 150 kilometers (93 miles) southwest of Seoul, carrying about 260,000 tons of crude oil -- or about 1.8 million barrels -- when it was hit by another vessel that was carrying a crane, the ministry official said.", 
                "The previously largest oil spill in South Korea happened in 1995 when about 5,035 tons -- about 35,000 barrels -- of crude and fuel oil was leaked, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency.", 
                "Environmental and other damage from Friday's spill would likely be less compared with 1995, said Jang Ki-pyo, a spokesman at the Maritime and Fisheries Ministry, as the leaked oil would be quickly frozen during cold winter temperatures and because the accident took place about 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) from shore.", 
                "The 1995 leak, which occurred in July, caused an estimated 73.5 billion won, at today's exchange rates equal to US$80 million (euro55 million), in damage.", 
                "In 1989, the Exxon Valdez supertanker released about 260,000 barrels, or 11 million gallons of oil into Alaska's Prince William Sound in what turned into a major environmental disaster.",

                "South Korea's Coast Guard said Friday it stopped oil leaking from a supertanker in seas near South Korea's west coast and was cleaning up what appeared to be the country's largest offshore spill.", 
                "About 66,000 barrels (10.5 million liters; 2.7 million gallons) of crude oil gushed from the 146,000-ton Hong Kong-registered ship after a crane-carrying vessel slammed into it at around 7:10 a.m. (2210 GMT Thursday), the Coast Guard said.", 
                "The site was about 6 nautical miles (7 miles; 11 kilometers) off Mallipo beach, approximately 150 kilometers (93 miles) southwest of Seoul, the Coast Guard said.", 
                "YTN, a 24-hour cable news channel, showed footage of the black oil leaking out of the ship and into the ocean.", 
                "The region is popular for scenic beaches, including Mallipo.", 
                "It is also home to a national maritime park and an important refueling stop for migratory birds.", 
                "Cho Sung-won, a regional Coast Guard spokesman, said the leak was stopped at around noon (0300 GMT).", 
                "The spill was believed to be South Korea's largest, according to the Coast Guard and the Maritime Ministry.", 
                "A spill in 1995, previously considered the largest, happened when about 5,035 tons -- about 35,000 barrels -- of crude and fuel oil was leaked.", 
                "Jung Se-hi, a spokesman at Coast Guard headquarters in Incheon, 40 kilometers (25 miles) west of Seoul, said 34 coast guard, navy and other government vessels as well as four helicopters were involved in the operation, with efforts focused on cleanup after the leak had been stopped.", 
                "Environmental and other damage from Friday's spill would likely be less compared with 1995, said Jang Ki-pyo, a Maritime and Fisheries Ministry official, as the leaked oil would be quickly frozen during cold winter temperatures and because the accident took place about 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) from shore.", 
                "It was unclear if any of the leaked oil had reached the shore, the Coast Guard's Jung said.", 
                "There were no human casualties in the accident, the Coast Guard said.", 
                "The tanker was at anchor, carrying about 260,000 tons of crude oil -- or about 1.8 million barrels -- when the accident happened.", 
                "The 1995 leak, which occurred in July, caused an estimated 73.5 billion won, at today's exchange rates equal to US$80 million (euro55 million), in damage.", 
                "In 1989, the Exxon Valdez supertanker released about 260,000 barrels, or 11 million gallons of oil into Alaska's Prince William Sound in what turned into a major environmental disaster.", 
                "------ Associated Press writers Kelly Olsen, Hyung-jin Kim and Jae-yeon Lim contributed to this report."

                "South Korea's Coast Guard dispatched dozens of ships Friday to prevent crude oil that leaked from a supertanker from reaching an ecologically sensitive shoreline on the country's west coast.", 
                "About 66,000 barrels (10.5 million liters; 2.7 million gallons) of oil gushed from the 146,000-ton Hong Kong-registered tanker after a crane-carrying barge slammed into it, the Coast Guard said.", 
                "Strong winds and prevailing currents meant oil was expected to start washing up on shore as early as Saturday morning and flow into fishing grounds and fishing farms, the Coast Guard said in a statement.", 
                "Maritime authorities set up a special fence 7.5 kilometers (5 miles) in length to try and contain the oil and planned to establish additional fences, the statement said.", 
                "The slick was 7.4 kilometers (4.6 miles) long and 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) wide, the Maritime and Fisheries Ministry said.", 
                "Chang Geun-ho, a ministry official, said the extent of environmental damage would depend on the success of the containment operation, though he added that cold winter temperatures could help slow the spread of the oil slick by freezing it.", 
                "Jung Se-hi, a spokesman at Coast Guard headquarters in Incheon, 40 kilometers (25 miles) west of Seoul, said the clean up operation would likely take at least three or four days.", 
                "The spill was believed to be South Korea's largest, according to the Coast Guard and the ministry.", 
                "A spill in 1995, previously considered the largest, involved a leak of about 5,035 tons -- about 35,000 barrels -- of crude and fuel oil.", 
                "The size of the leak reported by the authorities would be about one-fourth that of the 260,000 barrels, or 11 million gallons, of oil spilled into Alaska's Prince William Sound by the Exxon Valdez in 1989.", 
                "The site of the accident was about 6 nautical miles (7 miles; 11 kilometers) off Mallipo beach, approximately 150 kilometers (93 miles) southwest of Seoul.", 
                "The region is popular for scenic beaches, including Mallipo.", 
                "It is also home to a national maritime park and an important rest stop for migrating birds.", 
                "The accident occurred at 7:10 a.m. (2210 GMT Thursday), the Coast Guard said.", 
                "Cho Sung-won, a regional Coast Guard spokesman, said the leak was stopped at around noon (0300 GMT).", 
                "YTN, a 24-hour cable news channel, showed footage of the oil gushing out of the ship and into the ocean.", 
                "The Coast Guard said 46 ships, including navy and other government vessels, plus four helicopters, were involved in the operation.", 
                "Kim Tae-ho, a Coast Guard spokesman, said late Friday that operations had been suspended due to darkness and would resume after sunrise.", 
                "Kim said that some of the spilled oil had been collected, though he could not say how much.", 
                "The tanker, the Hebei Spirit, and the other vessel, owned by South Korea's Samsung Corp., were in no danger of sinking, the Coast Guard said.", 
                "There were no casualties in the accident, it said.", 
                "The tanker was at anchor and carrying about 260,000 tons of crude oil -- about 1.8 million barrels -- to be loaded into boats from a nearby port when it was hit by the South Korean barge which was being towed by a small tug boat, Kim said.", 
                "The barge, which was moving from a construction site, lost control after a wire linking it to the tug boat was cut due to high winds, waves and currents, he said.", 
                "Kim added that the Coast Guard would later question the barge's captain to find why he was sailing through the area despite the stormy weather.", 
                "The July 1995 leak caused damage estimated at 73.5 billion won, at today's exchange rates equal to US$80 million (euro55 million).", 
                "------ Associated Press writers Jae-soon Chang, Kelly Olsen and Jae-yeon Lim in Seoul contributed to this report."
