                "After the second round of killings, the gunman killed himself, the police said.", 
                "It was the deadliest shooting rampage in American history and came nearly eight years to the day after 13 people died at Columbine High School in Colorado at the hands of two disaffected students who then killed themselves.", 
                "As of Monday evening, only one of the Virginia Tech victims had been officially identified.", 
                "Police officials said they were not yet ready to identify the gunman or even say whether there was more than one in the attacks that wreaked devastation on this campus of 36,000 students, faculty members and staff.", 
                "The university's president, Charles W. Steger, expressed his \"horror and disbelief and sorrow\" at what he described as a tragedy of monumental proportions.", 
                "But questions were immediately raised about whether university officials had responded adequately to the shootings.", 
                "There was a two-hour gap between the first shootings, when two people were killed, and the second, when 30 were killed.", 
                "The university did not send a campuswide alert until the second incident had begun.", 
                "Steger defended the decision not to shut down or evacuate the campus after the first shootings, saying officials had believed the first incident was a self-contained event, which the campus police believed was a \"domestic\" dispute.", 
                "\"We had no reason to suspect any other incident was going to occur,\" he said.", 
                "The Virginia Tech attacks started early in the morning, with a call to police at 7:15 from West Ambler Johnston Hall, a 900-student freshman dormitory, as students were getting ready for classes or were on their way to them."
