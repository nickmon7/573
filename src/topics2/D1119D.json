                "Federal drug regulators have started a broad review of the safety of popular cough and cold remedies meant for children, a top official said Thursday.", 
                "The official, Dr. Charles J. Ganley, director of the office of nonprescription drug products at the Food and Drug Administration, said in an interview that the agency was \"revisiting the risks and benefits of the use of these drugs in children\" and that \"we're particularly concerned about the use of these drugs in children less than 2 years of age.", 
                "\" In high doses, cold medicines can affect the heart's electrical system, leading to arrhythmias.", 
                "Some medicines affect the blood vessels and in high doses have been associated with hypertension and stroke.", 
                "In rare cases, children have been injured even when given recommended doses.", 
                "In a recent study of hospital emergency room records from 2004 and 2005, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that at least 1,519 children who were 2 years old had suffered serious health problems after being treated with common cough and cold medicines.", 
                "Three of the children died, the disease control agency found.", 
                "The FDA said it was too early to predict whether the review would lead to new regulations.", 
                "Its comments came in response to a petition filed Thursday by a group of prominent pediatricians and public health officials demanding that the agency stop drug makers from marketing cold and cough medicines for children under 6.", 
                "The petition says that the medicines do not work and that in rare cases they can cause serious injury.", 
                "Popular medicines like Toddler's Dimetapp, Infant Triaminic and Little Colds, which are marketed for use in children as young as 2, should not be given to young children under any circumstances, the petition says.", 
                "Like hundreds of older drugs, many of the medicines in these products do not get a thorough safety review by the FDA.", 
                "\"So many people use these products even though they have no effect on colds and there's a real risk of a problem,\" said an author of the petition, Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, a pediatrician and the health commissioner of Baltimore.", 
                "Ganley, of the FDA, said most over-the-counter cold and cough medicines had not been tested adequately in children.", 
                "The doses recommended on many of the products' labels were no better than educated guesses, he said.", 
                "\"We have no data on these agents of what's a safe and effective dose in children,\" Ganley said.", 
                "Linda A. Suydam, president of the Consumer Healthcare Products Association, a trade group of companies that market over-the-counter cold remedies, said the remedies had been approved by the FDA and had been used for decades by millions of Americans.", 
                "Consumers should take only the recommended doses, Suydam said.", 
                "Doug Petkus, a spokesman for Wyeth, which makes Toddler's Dimetapp, agreed, adding that \"parents of children under the age of 2 are encouraged to seek the advice of a physician before administering any over-the-counter medicine.", 
                "\" Such cautions \"are clearly stated in product labeling,\" Petkus said.", 
                "The pediatricians who petitioned the drug agency acknowledged that children's cough and cold medicines were generally safe when given in recommended doses.", 
                "But they added that overdoses were common, for a variety of reasons.", 
                "Parents sometimes give their children two different brands, unaware that they contain the same active ingredients.", 
                "Overdoses can also result when frantic parents try to shove eyedroppers or cups of medicine into the mouths of crying, spitting babies.", 
                "The safety problems might be worth risking, the petitioners said, if the medicines worked to suppress coughs or clear stuffy noses.", 
                "But according to a growing number of studies in children, the drugs are no better than placebos.", 
                "\"There is widespread consensus that there is no good evidence for the effectiveness of several of the compounds used in cold medicines,\" said Dr. Ian M. Paul, an assistant professor of pediatrics at Penn State College of Medicine who has studied the medicines.", 
                "Last year, the American College of Chest Physicians recommended that parents avoid using cough and cold medicines in children, especially young ones, because the medicines can cause serious problems.", 
                "Despite these growing worries, sales of the drugs are booming.", 
                "Most major pharmacies carry a dozen or more brands.", 
                "The market for these medicines is fed by parents looking for anything to get their children to sleep peacefully.", 
                "Children suffer an average of six to 10 colds each year, far more than adults.", 
                "A 1994 study found that during one 30-day span, more than a third of the nation's 3-year-olds were estimated to have been given over-the-counter cough and cold remedies.", 
                "The products' labels and advertising strongly suggest that they work, many with flavors like grape and cherry.", 
                "Little Colds has a cartoon of a cheerful, crawling infant wearing only a diaper.", 
                "It promises that it \"safely and gently relieves.", 
                "\" Children's Vicks NyQuil has a cartoon that shows a small, sleeping child hugging a sleeping puppy.", 
                "\"Parents will do anything for their kids,\" said Sharfstein.", 
                "\"They will buy expensive syrups if they think their kid will do better.", 
                "\" (STORY CAN END HERE.", 
                ") Most cough and cold concoctions have nasal decongestants, antihistamines, cough suppressants or expectorants -- common ingredients with names like dextromethorphan, guaifenesin and phenylephrine.", 
                "Most of these drugs have been around for decades and were approved for sale by the FDA when standards were far lower than they are today.The agency has put all the compounds on a \"monograph,\" which means that drug manufacturers can use and combine them in pills and syrups without doing any of the expensive and lengthy studies that would be needed for a new drug.", 
                "Because the drugs are so widely available, there is no incentive for drug manufacturers to perform such studies.", 
                "Information about their lack of efficacy and worrisome side effects have trickled out.", 
                "Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of Public Citizen's Health Research Group and a longtime critic of the FDA, noted that cold medicines have a troubled history.", 
                "A decade ago, many such medicines contained phenylpropanolamine, or PPA, until studies showing that it could cause hemorrhagic stroke led the FDA to ban it.", 
                "Given such problems, Wolfe said, the agency years ago should have taken a closer look at all common cold medicines.", 
                "Sharfstein said there was now enough evidence about the dangers of the drugs for the FDA to act.", 
                "\"There is this incredible disparity between how the products are regulated and what the scientific evidence and consensus states,\" Sharfstein said."

                "Most over-the-counter cold and cough medicines have been insufficiently tested in children, said Ganley, the director of the FDA's office of nonprescription drug products.", 
                "\"We have no data on these agents of what's a safe and effective dose in children,\" he told The Times in an interview.",

                "A group of pediatricians and public health officials asked the agency Thursday to bar drug manufacturers from marketing such remedies as Toddler's Dimetapp, Infant Triaminic and Little Colds to children under 6.", 
                "A recent study by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that more than 1,500 children under 2 had experienced serious health problems -- and three died -- after taking common cold medicines in 2004 and 2005.",

                "The president of the Consumer Healthcare Products Association, which represents companies that sell over-the-counter cold drugs, noted that the medicines had FDA approval and had been used for decades.", 
                "They should be taken only in recommended doses, association president Linda A. Suydam said.", 
                "The pediatricians who petitioned the FDA Thursday acknowledged that children's cold medicines were generally safe in recommended doses, but they said overdoses were common because many children were given more than one medicine, among other reasons.", 
                "They also questioned the drugs' effectiveness in children.", 
                "Many cold and cough drugs won FDA approval decades ago, when the agency's standards were less strict, The Times reported."

                "Disclosure of the review, which will take months to complete, came as critics charged that many over-the-counter cough and cold remedies can harm toddlers and preschoolers.", 
                "Those critics, including public health officials and pediatricians, are pushing the government for stricter warnings to prevent life-threatening overdoses.",

                "The study's authors told parents to consult a doctor before giving the remedies to children under age 2.",

                "Safety experts for the Food and Drug Administration urged the agency on Friday to consider an outright ban on over-the-counter, multi-symptom cough and cold medicines for children under 6.", 
                "The recommendation, in a 356-page safety review, is the clearest signal yet that the agency may take strong action against the roughly 800 popular medicines marketed in the United States under names like Toddler's Dimetapp, Triaminic Infant and Little Colds.", 
                "The next step in the process will be a meeting of outside experts on Oct. 18-19 to examine the medicines' safety and offer recommendations to the agency.", 
                "In the new safety review, the FDA's experts suggested that all \"infant\" cough and cold formulations be removed from the market, and that the droppers, cups and syringes included with products for children be standardized to reduce the risks of confusion and overdose.", 
                "The reviewers wrote that there is little evidence that these medicines are effective in young children, and there are increasing fears that they may be dangerous.", 
                "From 1969 to 2006, at least 54 children died after taking decongestants, and 69 died after taking antihistamines, the report said.", 
                "And it added that since adverse drug reactions are reported voluntarily and fitfully, the numbers were likely to significantly understate the medicines' true toll.", 
                "The Consumer Healthcare Products Association, an industry trade group that has consistently defended the safety of pediatric cough and cold medicines, recommended in its own 156-page safety review, also released Friday, that the FDA consider mandatory warning labels saying that they should not be used in children younger than two.", 
                "Many cough and cold medicines now advise parents to \"consult a physician\" before use in such children.", 
                "The proposed warnings \"are recommendations that we have brought forth and we look forward to having a thorough discussion with the FDA,\" said Virginia Cox, a spokeswoman for the trade group.", 
                "Despite the industry's recommendation, many companies -- including such giants as Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson -- continue to sell cough and cold medicines with \"infant\" in their titles and pictures of babies on their labels.", 
                "Mark Boston, a spokesman for a Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson subsidiary that sells pediatric cough and cold medicines, said the company \"supports the materials\" that the trade association submitted to the FDA, but declined to say why the company continues to sell such products as \"Concentrated Tylenol Infants' Drops Plus Cold.", 
                "\" Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, Baltimore's commissioner of health and an author of a petition that led the FDA to conduct its current review, cheered its new report, saying it raised serious questions about why anyone would give cough and cold medicines to young children.", 
                "\"These products are used by hundreds of thousands of kids every year, but no one can say that they're safe or effective,\" he said.", 
                "The petition followed a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that found that more than 1,500 children under the age of two had suffered serious health problems between 2004 and 2005 after being treated with common cough and cold medicines.", 
                "Current figures on the medicines' sales and use are not available, but in 1994 researchers reported in The Journal of the American Medical Association that more than a third of all three-year-olds in the United States were given over-the-counter cough and cold preparations in one 30-day span.", 
                "The petition noted that in 1990, Americans spent nearly $2 billion on these medications, and it said that in a typical drugstore, over 30 separate cough and cold preparations are marketed to parents for use in children.", 
                "Also on Friday, the FDA warned the makers of nearly 200 unapproved prescription medicines containing the pain-and-cough-relief drug hydrocodone that by Oct. 31 they must stop making these products for children under six.", 
                "Makers of all other unapproved hydrocodone products have until Dec. 31 to stop making them.", 
                "Hydrocodone is a narcotic that is widely used to treat pain and suppress cough.", 
                "There are seven FDA-approved prescription cough products containing hydrocodone, and doctors can continue to write prescriptions for those.", 
                "The agency's safety review and its decision to ban unapproved hydrocodone products both result from gradual but significant changes in the standards used for drug approvals.", 
                "In the case of pediatric over-the-counter medicines, the agency decided decades ago that drug makers could market the medicines for children even though they had only been tested in adults.", 
                "Back then, it was assumed that children's bodies were simply smaller versions of adult ones.", 
                "That assumption has proven untrue.", 
                "Indeed, a growing number of studies suggest that cough and cold medicines work no better in children than placebos.", 
                "Despite this, there are 800 such products on the market and sales have long been strong.", 
                "Most major pharmacies carry a dozen or more brands.", 
                "The medicines are popular largely because children have an average of six to 10 colds each year, far more than adults.", 
                "Similarly, hydrocodone has never been shown to be safe and effective in children, and its dangers as a powerful and potentially addictive narcotic are clear.", 
                "Even more broadly, 200 hydrocodone-containing products never won approval from the modern-day FDA.", 
                "There are thousands of such unapproved drugs on the market.", 
                "Indeed, an estimated 2 percent of all prescriptions are written for unapproved products.", 
                "Most have been around for decades, and the FDA is gradually forcing their makers to either get official approval or stop selling them."

                "Major makers of over-the-counter infant cough and cold medicines announced Thursday that they were voluntarily withdrawing their products from the market for fear that they could be misused by parents.", 
                "The voluntary withdrawal affects only products labeled for \"infants,\" not those for use in children 2 and older.", 
                "And some small companies may continue selling the products.", 
                "The move comes two weeks after safety reviewers within the Food and Drug Administration urged the agency to consider an outright ban of over-the-counter cough and cold products for children under the age of 6.", 
                "Even the industry's own trade association, the Consumer Healthcare Products Association, recommended two weeks ago that the products should no longer be used for infants.", 
                "Despite this recommendation, makers continued to sell cough and cold products labeled for infants.", 
                "Last week, Rep. Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif., who is chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, sent a letter to the industry's trade association asking why \"in direct contradiction to this recommendation, however, many C.H.P.A.", 
                "member companies are currently marketing these products for use in children under 2.", 
                "\" Next week, a committee of outside experts will meet to consider the safety of these medicines and offer recommendations to the agency.", 
                "There are roughly 800 over-the-counter pediatric cough and cold products.", 
                "In the year prior to July 15, makers sold at least 41 million packages of these in the United States, according to the healthcare products group, about a fifth of which were sold in the form of \"drops\" that are generally targeted for use in infants.", 
                "The industry said that the medicines are safe and effective when used as directed.", 
                "\"The reason the makers of over-the-counter, oral cough and cold medicine for infants are withdrawing these medicines is that there have been rare patterns of misuse leading to overdose recently identified, particularly in infants, and safety is our top priority,\" said Linda A. Suydam, president of the trade association.", 
                "There is very little evidence that cough and cold medicines are effective in young children, and there are increasing fears that they may be dangerous.", 
                "From 1969 to 2006, at least 45 children died after taking decongestants, and 69 died after taking antihistamines, the industry association has said.", 
                "Many of these children were injured after their parents mistakenly gave them too much, either because they did not realize that products from two different makers contained identical medicine, or the parents measured doses poorly.", 
                "But there are growing reports that even children given recommended quantities of the medicines are at risk.", 
                "The Poison Control Center of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia recently reported on four cases of prolonged hallucinations in children as old as 6 who were given recommended doses of the medicines.", 
                "With almost no evidence that they are effective and growing worries that they may be unsafe, a group of prominent pediatricians petitioned the agency earlier this year to consider banning the drugs' use in young children.", 
                "Among the products being withdrawn are Dimetapp Decongestant Infant Drops, Little Colds Decongestant Plus Cough, Pediacare Infant Drops Decongestant, Robitussin Infant Cough DM Drops, Triaminic Infant and Toddler Thin Strips Decongestant, and Tylenol Concentrated Infant Drops Plus Cold and Cough.", 
                "Dimetapp and Robitussin are products of Wyeth; Little Colds is made by the Medtech Products unit of Prestige Brands Holdings; Tylenol and Pediacare are made by the McNeil Consumer Healthcare unit of Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson; and Triaminic is made by Novartis.", 
                "None of the companies' stocks moved significantly on Thursday; by midafternoon Novartis and Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson were trading slightly higher, and Wyeth and Prestige Brands slightly lower."

                "Major makers of over-the-counter infant cough and cold medicines announced Thursday that they were withdrawing their products from the market for fear that they could be misused by parents.", 
                "The voluntary withdrawal, already under way, affects only products labeled for use in infants, not for use in children 2 and older.", 
                "And some small companies could continue selling infant products.", 
                "More changes, perhaps mandated by federal drug regulators, could be in the offing.", 
                "The withdrawal comes two weeks after safety reviewers within the Food and Drug Administration urged the agency to consider an outright ban of over-the-counter cough and cold products for children under 6.", 
                "Even the industry's main trade group, the Consumer Healthcare Products Association, recommended two weeks ago that the products not be used on infants.", 
                "Despite the recommendation, giant drugmakers like Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson, Wyeth and Novartis continued to sell cough and cold products labeled for infants.", 
                "Last week, Rep. Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif., chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, sent a letter to the industry's trade association asking why the products were still being sold.", 
                "Until Thursday, industry representatives answered that they were discussing the issue with the FDA and defended their medicines as safe and effective.", 
                "\"The reason the makers of over-the-counter oral cough and cold medicine for infants are withdrawing these medicines is that there have been rare patterns of misuse leading to overdose recently identified, particularly in infants,\" said Linda A. Suydam, president of the trade association.", 
                "\"Safety is our top priority,\" Suydam added.", 
                "Sen. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., criticized the drug agency for a delayed withdrawal.", 
                "\"The FDA should be first to act to ensure consumer safety rather than leaving families to rely on the industry itself,\" Schumer said.", 
                "Next week, a committee of outside experts will consider the safety of these medicines and offer recommendations to the agency.", 
                "Dianne Murphy, director of the agency's office of pediatric therapeutics, said in an interview that in addition to asking basic questions about the drugs' safety and effectiveness, the agency intended to question the experts closely about the advisability of combination medicines.", 
                "It will also explore how to address the issue of accurate dosing when there are a dizzying array of measuring devices, some provided by the manufacturers and some not.", 
                "\"These measuring devices, we would hope that is an area that would change,\" Murphy said.", 
                "The experts will also consider whether children from 2 to 6 should be given these medicines.", 
                "\"I don't recommend their use in any child,\" said Dr. Daniel Frattarelli, a pediatrician from Detroit who serves on the American Academy of Pediatrics' committee on drugs.", 
                "\"These medicines don't help, they may hurt, so don't use them.", 
                "\" There are roughly 800 over-the-counter pediatric cough and cold products.", 
                "In the fiscal year that ended July 15, makers sold at least 41 million units of these products in the United States, about a fifth of which were sold in the form of drops that are generally given to infants, according to the trade association.", 
                "A 1994 study found that more than a third of all 3-year-olds in the country were given over-the-counter cough and cold preparations in one 30-day span.", 
                "The products being withdrawn include Dimetapp Decongestant Infant Drops and Robitussin Infant Cough DM Drops, both made by Wyeth; Little Colds Decongestant Plus Cough, by Prestige Brands; Pediacare Infant Drops Decongestant and Tylenol Concentrated Infant Drops Plus Cold and Cough, both by Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson; and Triaminic Infant &amp;amp; Toddler Thin Strips Decongestant, by Novartis.", 
                "Companies would not disclose sales figures for the products.", 
                "Prestige Brands said that its two withdrawn products represented about 1 percent of its net sales, which were $318.6 million in its 2007 fiscal year.", 
                "Doug Petkus, a Wyeth spokesman, said the withdrawals would \"have minimal impact on the company.", 
                "\" Wyeth's entire line of Robitussin products had $225.5 million in sales last year.", 
                "Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson does not report overall Tylenol sales but has hinted that they approach $1 billion annually.", 
                "There is little evidence that cough and cold medicines are effective in young children, and there are increasing fears that they may be dangerous.", 
                "From 1969 to 2006, at least 45 children died in the United States after taking decongestants, and 69 died after taking antihistamines, according to the FDA.", 
                "Many children sickened after they were mistakenly given too much -- either because parents failed to realize that products from two makers contained identical medicines or because parents had given improper amounts.", 
                "But there are a growing number of reports that even children given recommended doses are at risk.", 
                "The Poison Control Center of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia recently reported four cases of prolonged hallucinations in children as old as 6 who were given recommended doses.", 
                "Infant cough-and-cold products were approved decades ago without adequate testing in children because experts assumed that children were simply small adults, and that drugs approved for adults must also work in children.", 
                "More recent research showed that neither assumption was true.", 
                "Indeed, recent studies suggest that pediatric cough and cold medicines work no better than placebos.", 
                "Joshua M. Sharfstein, the Baltimore commissioner of health, cheered the withdrawals but said that the FDA should ban all such products so that smaller companies do not continue to sell them.", 
                "\"We believe that companies should also stop marketing cough and cold products for toddlers,\" Sharfstein said.", 
                "Dr. Andrew D. Racine, a pediatrician at the Children's Hospital at Montefiore in the Bronx, said that most parents who give cold medicines to young children were just hoping for a good night's sleep themselves.", 
                "Racine said that he tells all new parents never to combine cough and cold medicines and to expect that their child will get six to eight colds each year.", 
                "\"When you become a parent,\" he said, \"you have to be prepared for some sleepless nights.", 
                "\" Murphy of the FDA said parents should be more cautious about using such medicines.", 
                "\"All drugs have risks,\" she said, \"and these drugs are mostly used to treat symptoms and not the underlying disease, and we need to be very careful about deciding whether and when to use them or not."
