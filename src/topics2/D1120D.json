                "For Arizona water managers, the $280 million desalter represented a way to stretch the Colorado River a little further, hedging against drought and growing demand.", 
                "Up and running, the desalter could convert billions of gallons of agriculture wastewater each year into a usable resource, preserving long-term storage in Lake Mead and protecting Arizona from shortages.", 
                "For environmental groups, the plant embodied a destructive \"use-it-up\" attitude about water and a direct threat to a thriving wetland 90 miles south in Sonora.",

                "Without the water, the wetland would dry up.", 
                "Not quite three years ago, on a beach in the bottom of the Grand Canyon, a water manager and an environmentalist struck up a conversation.", 
                "Before long, they were working on a plan that would ultimately recast the desalter as a symbol of two disparate interests finding common ground.", 
                "The plan faces its first test in early March, when the federal government restarts the plant for a 90-day, low-power test run.", 
                "Officially, the test will help determine whether the desalter still works, how much operating it full time would cost and how it would affect the wetland known as the Cienega de Santa Clara, a critical habitat for migratory birds.", 
                "But the test will provide more than just technical data.", 
                "It also will bring together the West's water buffaloes - the use-it-up gang - and the increasingly influential conservation movement for a grand experiment in the management and the politics of water.", 
                "\"The Colorado River is absolutely a finite resource, and we have to be careful in how we manage it,\" said Jennifer Pitt, a senior resource analyst for the advocacy group Environmental Defense who was part of that first campfire conversation.", 
                "\"But the truth is there's a lot of water there.", 
                "We've seen time and time again that the law of the river can be flexible enough to meet the needs of water users in the basin.",

                "\"Crews are busy checking pipes, checking pumps, checking for leaks.", 
                "People have been working here 15 years or more, and we've never really operated the plant.", 
                "\" The desalter's original purpose was to help the United States meet the terms of a water-quality treaty with Mexico, which protested the increasing levels of salt and other nutrients in the Colorado River by the time it reached the border.", 
                "The bureau decided to divert water drained from farm fields in the nearby Wellton-Mohawk Valley, remove the salt and send it down the river.", 
                "After floods washed away one of the diversion canals in 1992, the bureau mothballed the plant, just nine months after turning it on.", 
                "A series of wet years rendered it unnecessary.", 
                "Since then, Cherry has presided over a group of caretakers, who kept the plant in working condition, and a group of scientists who developed a water-treatment research center using a one-hundredth scale version of the plant.", 
                "Cherry said the researchers used the time well.", 
                "They increased the plant's efficiency from a 73 percent recovery rate, when 10 gallons of raw water produced slightly more than seven gallons of treated water, to about 85 percent.", 
                "They also tried desalting local groundwater to see if the plant could produce drinking water someday for small communities on either side of the border.", 
                "\"The plant was authorized to do one thing,\" Cherry said, \"but we can study whether we could do other things.", 
                "\" It's the one thing - stretching the over-allocated Colorado River - that stuck in the minds of Arizona water managers.", 
                "When drought struck the river in the early years of this decade, lowering reservoir storage by half, state officials brought up the idea of restarting the desalination plant.", 
                "To meet the Mexican treaty terms without the desalter, the bureau had been drawing water from Lake Mead at the rate of about 100,000 acre-feet a year, more than 32 billion gallons.", 
                "From the day the plant stopped running in 1992, water continued to flow over the border down the delivery channels, which meant, on paper, Mexico was receiving more than its share of river water.", 
                "The solution, Arizona officials argued, was clear: Turn the desalter back on.", 
                "That is when the birds flew into the picture.", 
                "The conflict All that water flowing past the desalter into Sonora didn't just vanish into the desert.", 
                "It collected in a geological depression formed by a branch of the San Andreas Fault and revived a wetland that had nearly dried up.", 
                "Inside of a decade, the marshy area grew from a few hundred acres, derisively called the Santa Clara Slough, to the 40,000-acre Cienega de Santa Clara, a wetland that harbors some of the rarest species in the hemisphere.", 
                "\"It's the most biologically significant wetland in the Sonoran Desert,\" said Karl Flessa, a University of Arizona geosciences professor.", 
                "\"It is a remnant wetland of what was once an enormous complex of wetlands that were either converted to ag land or have simply dried up.", 
                "The idea here is we better hang on to what we've got.", 
                "It's the last stand for wetlands on the Mexican side.", 
                "\" Conservation groups rallied against restarting the desalter because, as designed, it would take most of the water feeding the wetland and return only the sludge left from the desalination process.", 
                "Environmentalists attacked the desalter as a waste of money, a white elephant that would trample a delicate slice of desert life.", 
                "For many activists the wetland also helped support arguments for restoring water to the larger Colorado River Delta, a 1.9 million acre expanse from the U.S.-Mexican border to the Gulf of California, the river's historic endpoint.", 
                "The river rarely reaches the delta anymore, its flow sucked dry by dams, canals and other diversion points along its final miles.", 
                "The Santa Clara offered on-the-ground proof that a little water could help revive the delta.", 
                "\"One of the reasons the delta is so interesting is that simply adding water will get you a quick response,\" said Michael Cohen, a senior researcher at the Pacific Institute, an environmental research group.", 
                "\"In the early 1990s, floods flowed through the river and the cottonwoods and willows came back.",

                "In the spring of 2004, Bennett Raley, then a deputy Interior secretary, took a group of water managers, environmentalists and journalists on a rafting trip on the Colorado, hoping to spark conversations about the river's future.", 
                "Among the rafters were Pitt, the Environmental Defense analyst who wanted the desalter kept silent, and Sid Wilson, general manager of the Central Arizona Project, who was leading the charge to restart the plant.", 
                "Pitt had recently signed a letter to Gov.", 
                "Janet Napolitano, asking her to block the desalter's operation, and everyone on the trip knew it.", 
                "For Wilson, the issue was basic: In the event of a shortage on the Colorado, the CAP canal, which delivers river water to Phoenix and Tucson, takes the first and biggest hit.", 
                "Anything to keep water in Lake Mead could forestall a shortage.", 
                "\"When we started talking about it, the U.S. position was that it cost too much,\" Wilson said.", 
                "\"The governor had letters from the environmental organizations opposing it.", 
                "Pitt and Wilson continued talking after the trip, and inside of a few months, they hatched an idea to organize a working study group.", 
                "That group produced a plan to operate the desalter in a way that could still protect the Cienega de Santa Clara.", 
                "\"I'd invested a lot of energy in simply trying to tell the world what a problem the plant would be,\" Pitt said.",

                "Global warming will worsen drought and reduce flows on the Colorado River, a key water source for several western states, according to a report released Wednesday.", 
                "The study, prepared by a National Research Council committee, paints a sobering picture as the water needs of a rapidly expanding population test the limits of a river system strained by the effects of climate change.", 
                "``The basin is going to face increasingly costly, controversial and unavoidable trade-off choices,'' said Ernest Smerdon, who chaired the panel of academicians and scientists who wrote the report.", 
                "``Increasing demands are impeding the region's ability to cope with droughts and water shortages.", 
                "'' Such measures as conservation, desalination and water recycling would be helpful, the authors said, but wouldn't offer a panacea.", 
                "The report, which examined climate modeling and tree ring data, reaffirms a more pessimistic assessment of river hydrology that has emerged in recent years.", 
                "Scientists have concluded that the Colorado river system, which supplies water to 25 million people and several million acres of crop and ranch land, has been drier and more prone to severe drought than was the case in the early 20th century, when the river's flows were divvied among the seven basin states.", 
                "It turns out that period was unusually wet, prompting an overly generous estimate of how much water would be available to farms and cities.", 
                "Ancient tree rings, which provide graphic evidence of past precipitation patterns, indicate it had been three centuries since the basin was last awash with that much water.", 
                "The most recent drought began in 2000 and has left the river's biggest reservoirs, Lake Mead and Lake Powell, roughly half empty.", 
                "``Now that is not a happy picture,'' Smerdon said.", 
                "``What we want people to do is to be aware of these scientific facts and take them into account as they plan for development, for drought-contingency plans.", 
                "'' Global warming will only make matters worse, said Connie Woodhouse, a University of Arizona associate professor of geography who helped write the report.", 
                "``It's going to enhance the droughts'' that are part of the natural climate cycle.", 
                "Although the river's flows returned to normal in 2005 after five years of dramatic lows, they fell again last year.", 
                "Federal scientists say that if they remain below average or even average, Lake Mead might never completely refill.", 
                "The study, which was sponsored by the National Academies, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation and several water agencies, notes that temperatures have risen in the western United States over the past century and are expected to keep climbing.", 
                "``All of the models are predicting very significant warming in the future,'' said Smerdon, a former engineering college dean at the University of Arizona in Tucson.", 
                "The report acknowledges some uncertainty over whether climate change would alter the amount of precipitation in the basin.", 
                "But as the mercury rises, water demands would increase.", 
                "There would be more evaporation from croplands and reservoirs, and wild land vegetation would suck more moisture from the soil, reducing runoff.", 
                "``I think a reasonably savvy person would have to say you're going to see less water in that river,'' said Brad Udall, director of Western Water Assessment at the University of Colorado in Boulder, who was not a member of the report committee.", 
                "``The real question is how much less.", 
                "Is it 5 percent less or is it 40 percent less and by when?", 
                "'' The U.S. Department of Interior, which oversees the Colorado's management, is reviewing a drought plan the states put together last year.", 
                "Because California holds some of the most senior rights to the river, Arizona, Nevada and Mexico would experience cuts in deliveries before California, said Roger Patterson, assistant general manager of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California.", 
                "The river is a major source for Metropolitan, Southern California's major urban water supplier.", 
                "Last year about 30 percent of the agency's water deliveries came from the Colorado, which provides about 10 percent of California's overall urban and agricultural supplies.", 
                "Most of the state's river allotment -- the biggest in the system -- goes to the Imperial Irrigation District, which distributes water to the croplands of the Imperial Valley, one of the nation's biggest lettuce producers.", 
                "Noting that farms remain the dominant water user in the Colorado basin, the report called agricultural water ``the most important and perhaps final large reservoir of available water for urban use in the arid U.S.", 
                "'' But that supply is also finite, the authors emphasized, and shifting water from farm to city could have negative impacts.", 
                "Transfers could hurt rural economies, lower food production and rob wildlife of leaking irrigation water that nourishes important habitat."

                "A Western drought that began in 1999 has continued after the respite of a couple of wet years that now feel like a cruel tease.", 
                "But this time people in the driest states are not just scanning the skies and hoping for meteorological rescue.", 
                "Some $2.5 billion in water projects are planned or under way in four states, the biggest expansion in the West's quest for water in decades.", 
                "Among them is a proposed 280-mile pipeline that would direct water to Las Vegas from northern Nevada.", 
                "A proposed reservoir just north of the California-Mexico border would correct an inefficient water delivery system that allows excess water to pass to Mexico.", 
                "In Yuma, Ariz., federal officials have even restarted an idled desalination plant, long seen as a white elephant from a bygone era, partly in the hope of purifying salty underground water for neighboring towns.", 
                "The scramble for water is driven by the realities of population growth, political pressure and the hard truth that the Colorado River, a 1,400-mile-long silver thread of snowmelt and a lifeline for more than 20 million people in seven states, is providing much less water than it had.", 
                "According to some long-term projections, the mountain snows that feed the Colorado River will melt faster and evaporate in greater amounts with rising global temperature, providing stress to the waterway even without drought.", 
                "This year, the spring runoff is expected to be about half its long-term average.", 
                "In only one year of the last seven -- 2005 -- has the runoff been above average.", 
                "Everywhere in the West, along the Colorado and other rivers, as officials search for water to fill current and future needs, tempers are flaring among competing water users, old rivalries are hardening and some states are waging legal fights.", 
                "In one of the most acrimonious disputes, Montana filed a suit in February at the U.S. Supreme Court accusing Wyoming of taking more than its fair share of water from the Tongue and Powder Rivers, north-flowing tributaries of the Yellowstone River that supply water for farms and wells in both states.", 
                "Preparing for worst-case outcomes, the seven states that draw water from the Colorado River -- Colorado, Wyoming, Utah and New Mexico in the upper basin and California, Arizona and Nevada in the lower basin -- and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, which manages the river, are considering plans that lay out what to do if the river cannot meet the demand for water -- a prospect that some experts predict will occur in about five years.", 
                "\"What you are hearing about global warming, explosive growth -- combine with a real push to set aside extra water for environmental purpose -- means you got a perfect situation for a major tug-of-war contest,\" said Sid Wilson, the general manager of the Central Arizona Project, which brings Colorado River water to the Phoenix area.", 
                "New scientific evidence suggests that periodic long, severe droughts have become the norm in the Colorado River basin, undermining calculations of how much water the river can be expected to provide for the region's future and intensifying pressures to find new solutions or sources.", 
                "The effects of the drought can be seen at Lake Mead in Nevada, where a drop in the water level left docks hanging from newly formed cliffs, and a marina surrounded by dry land.", 
                "Upriver at Lake Powell, which is at its lowest level since spring 1973, receding waters have exposed miles of mud in the fingered side canyons leading to the Glen Canyon Dam.", 
                "Arnold Schwarzenegger has sounded alarm bells by pushing for a ballot measure in 2008 that would allocate $4.5 billion in bonds for new water storage in the state.", 
                "The water content in the Sierra Nevada snowpack has reached the lowest level in about two decades, state hydrologists have reported, putting additional pressure on the nation's most populous state to find and store more water.", 
                "\"Scientists say that global warming will eliminate 25 percent of our snowpack by the half of this century,\" Schwarzenegger said recently in Fresno, Calif., \"which will mean less snow stored in the mountains, which will mean more flooding in the winter and less drinking water in the summer.", 
                "\" (STORY CAN END HERE.", 
                ") In Montana, where about two-thirds of the Missouri River and half of the Columbia River have their headwaters, officials have embarked on a long-term project to validate old water-rights claims in an effort to legally shore up supplies the state now counts on.", 
                "Under the West's water laws, claims are hierarchal.", 
                "The oldest, first-filed claims, many dating to pioneer days, get water first, with newer claims at the bottom of the pecking order.", 
                "Still, some of the sharpest tensions stem more from population growth than cautionary climate science, especially those between Nevada and Utah, states with booming desert economies and clout to fight for what they say is theirs.", 
                "Las Vegas, the fastest growing major city in the country, and the driest, developed the pipeline plan several years ago to bring groundwater from the rural, northern reaches of the state.", 
                "The metropolitan area, which relies on the Colorado River for 90 percent of its water, is awaiting approval from Nevada's chief engineer.", 
                "Ranchers and farmers in northern Nevada and Utah are opposed to the pipeline plan and have vowed to fight it in court, saying it smacks of the famous water grab by Los Angeles nearly a century ago that caused severe environmental damage in the Owens Valley in California.", 
                "\"Southern Nevada thinks it can come up here and suck all these springs dry without any problems,\" said Dean Baker, whose family's ranch straddles the Nevada-Utah border, pointing out springs that farmers have run dry with their own wells.", 
                "\"We did this ourselves.", 
                "Now imagine what pumping for a whole big city is going to do.", 
                "\" Meanwhile, Utah has proposed a $500 million, 120-mile pipeline from Lake Powell to serve the fast-growing City of St. George and Washington County in the state's southwestern corner.", 
                "Nevada officials have said they will seek to block that plan if Utah stands in the way of theirs.", 
                "\"Utah is being very disingenuous and we're calling them on it,\" said Patricia Mulroy, the chief executive of the Southern Nevada Water Authority, the water agency responsible for finding water for Las Vegas and its suburbs.", 
                "\"St. George, Utah, is growing as fast as southern Nevada, because the growth is going right up the I-15 corridor.", 
                "Strong, director of Utah's Division of Water Resources, said Nevada was protesting too much and instead should be cheering the Lake Powell project because Colorado River water that Utah does not use would flow in Nevada's direction.", 
                "Strong said that Nevada's protests \"may be a bargaining chip.", 
                "\" He said he hoped for a compromise that would allow both projects to move forward.", 
                "In Yuma, on the Arizona border with Mexico, officials have pinned hopes on a desalination plant built 15 years ago.", 
                "The plan then had been to treat salty runoff from farms before it made its way into the Colorado River headed to Mexico, thus meeting the terms of an old water treaty.", 
                "But a series of unusually wet years made it more efficient to meet the treaty obligations with water from Lake Mead, so the plant sat idle.", 
                "Drought has changed all that.", 
                "Arizona water managers, who are first in line to have their water cut in a shortage under an agreement with other states, called for the plant to be turned on.", 
                "Under an agreement with environmentalists, the federal Bureau of Reclamation plans to closely monitor the environmental effects of using the plant, and study, among other things, using the purified water for purposes other than meeting its treaty obligations, like supplying the growing cities around Yuma.", 
                "\"It never made sense to me to just dump bottled-water quality water into the river anyway,\" said Jim Cherry, the bureau's Yuma area manager.", 
                "What unites the Western states is a growing consensus among scientists that future climate change and warmer temperatures, if they continue, could hit harder here than elsewhere in the continental United States.", 
                "\"The Western mountain states are by far more vulnerable to the kinds of change we've been talking about compared to the rest of the country, with the New England states coming in a relatively distant second,\" said Dr. Michael Dettinger, a research hydrologist at the U.S. Geological Survey who studies the relationships between water and climate.", 
                "Dettinger said warmer temperatures have pushed the spring snowmelt and runoff to about 10 days earlier on average than in the past.", 
                "Higher temperatures would mean more rain falling rather than snow, compounding issues of water storage and potentially affecting flooding.", 
                "In some places, the new tensions and pressures could even push water users toward compromise.", 
                "Colorado recently hired a mediator to try to settle a long-running dispute over how water from the Rocky Mountains should be shared among users in the Denver area and the western half of the state.", 
                "Denver gets most of the water and has most of the state's population.", 
                "But water users in the mountains, notably the ski resort industry, also have clout and want to keep their share.", 
                "Robert W. Johnson, the Bureau of Reclamation commissioner, said he shared the optimism that the disputes could be worked out, but he said he thought it might take a reconsideration of the West's original conception of what water was for.", 
                "The great dams and reservoirs that were envisioned beginning in the 1800s were conceived with farmers in mind, and farmers still take about 90 percent of the Colorado River's flow.", 
                "More and more, he said, the cities will need that water.", 
                "An agreement reached a few years ago between farmers and the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, the chief supplier of water to that region, is one model.", 
                "Under the terms of the agreement, farmers would fallow their fields and send water to urban areas in exchange for money to cover the crop losses.", 
                "\"I definitely see that as the future,\" Johnson said."

                "Down the mountain, a multitude of rivulets seep from the edge of Quelccaya to irrigate crops of maize, the water flowing through irrigation canals built by the Incas.",

                "The Colorado River Delta was once a watery labyrinth of willow thickets, mesquite and cottonwood, bigger than the state of Rhode Island and teeming with bird and animal life.", 
                "Today it is a barren expanse of salt-stained mudflats where the river used to meet the sea south of Yuma, Ariz .", 
                "About 90 percent of the delta's wetlands and natural habitat dried up over the past half century, as water from the Colorado was captured in reservoirs and diverted to farms and cities from Las Vegas to Mexicali, Mexico.", 
                "For more than a decade, conservation groups in the U.S. and Mexico have tried unsuccessfully to restore North America's largest desert estuary.", 
                "Now the Sonoran Institute is warning that unless restoration is undertaken before a prolonged dry spell, which many scientists are predicting, it could be too late.", 
                "In its forthcoming analysis of the delta, the nonprofit Arizona institute paints a dire picture of the once-vibrant ecosystem.", 
                "But it also puts forth a proposal for replenishing much of the area by replacing a fraction of the river water that once flowed through the delta, saying it would be enough to restore much of the area's natural wealth.", 
                "Under the institute's plan, the delta would get about three-tenths of a percent of the river's historic annual flow, making it one of the more modest claims on a river that serves 30 million people.", 
                "But even that amount could be a hard sell.", 
                "Eight years of drought in the Colorado watershed have raised the likelihood of shortages in the near future, and as officials in the U.S. and Mexico look for creative ways of limiting future cutbacks, every drop will count.", 
                "The river's annual flow has fallen as low as 25 percent of normal since 2000, and some scientists have predicted that with the growing influence of climate change, flows will average 50 percent to 60 percent of normal over the next 50 years.", 
                "Later this year, Interior Secretary Dick Kempthorne is expected to announce the first-ever guidelines for managing reduced water deliveries from the Colorado in the event of shortages.", 
                "Officials say a shortage will be declared when the water level at Lake Mead drops 36 feet below its current level, a change that is expected within the next few years.", 
                "As the government draws up plans for dealing with a reduced water supply, environmentalists believe restoration must be made a priority or the delta will be doomed.", 
                "\"If we fail right now, we might really fail, as the shortage becomes a reality and discussions about saving water for conservation become a lot harder,\" said Jennifer Pitt, a policy analyst with the group Environmental Defense, which works closely with the Sonoran Institute.", 
                "Advocates for the delta have little legal leverage.", 
                "Neither the 1944 treaty that allocates Colorado River water to Mexico nor any environmental law in that country mandates water for the delta.", 
                "Late last year, in support of efforts by California to reclaim water that has been seeping across the border and nourishing crops and wetlands in the delta, Congress passed legislation barring the use of U.S. environmental laws to protect Mexico's interests.", 
                "But the Sonoran Institute contends that there is still nearly enough unclaimed water in the river to revive the delta without impinging on any existing rights on either side of the border.", 
                "\"What we are talking about is the slop, leakage and waste discharges, \" said Peter Culp, a lawyer who represents the institute.", 
                "It's the water that slips past Mexico's Morelos Dam after an upriver storm or that trickles back to the river from irrigated fields.", 
                "For 30 years, the crown jewel of the delta's remaining wetlands, the 40,000-acre Cienega de Santa Clara in Sonora, Mexico, has relied entirely on brackish discharges from a nearby irrigation district.", 
                "The problem with such releases, however, is that they can't be counted on forever and don't always occur when nature needs them.", 
                "To ensure timely flows, the institute has proposed amending the 1944 treaty to allow Mexico to bank water in the U.S. and participate in a bi-national water market.", 
                "\"There are significant human benefits to the proposal,\" said Mark Lellouch, one of its authors.", 
                "About 200,000 people live in scattered communities in the delta, Lellouch said, and restoration would provide more sustenance and more jobs.", 
                "Even now, nature tourism is a going concern.", 
                "Visitors from the U.S. and Mexico are drawn to the Cienega de Santa Clara and other destinations by the estimated 350,000 birds that still nest and feed in the delta.", 
                "\"There are a number of stakeholders in Mexico interested in that environment,\" said Steve Smullen, principal engineer for the International Boundary and Water Commission, the agency that administers water-rights treaties between the United States and Mexico.", 
                "But he said the institute's plan \" works against agricultural interest, conservative interest and the interests of large communities\" vying for the water .", 
                "\"If there's enough will, you can make anything happen,\" he said.", 
                "\"But it's an uphill battle."

                "But the lake was lapping at the top of Hoover Dam just two decades ago.", 
                "For years its \"normal\" elevation ranged between 1,180 and 1,220 feet above sea level; today it is at 1,111 feet, and predicted to drop below 1,100 feet within two years.", 
                "Now there are tense meetings among several states that rely on the Colorado.",

                "Mulroy said the agreement, reached after \"four years of chest beating\" and \"some very childish behavior\" among the states, is much more equitable.", 
                "\"We had to succeed,\" she said.", 
                "\"We could spend the next 20 years in the Supreme Court.", 
                "In the meantime, we'd all be sucking air.", 
                "\" In a separate plan, the Southern Nevada Water Authority proposes purchasing and pumping billions of gallons of groundwater from rural east-central Nevada for use by Las Vegas, an idea that's sparked much controversy.", 
                "Some environmentalists say parts of the state could become a dust bowl.", 
                "Some rural Nevadans resent the expanding city.", 
                "And some Utah officials want a federal study to make sure the pipeline doesn't tap into Utah's aquifer - a request Mulroy says would interfere with Nevada's sovereign right.", 
                "\"It's going to get uglier before it gets better,\" Mulroy predicted.", 
                "Controlling growth, she said, is not an option -although environmentalists insist the area's population explosion must be curtailed.",

                "One way water officials are trying to do that is through the Las Vegas Springs Preserve.", 
                "On the site of the defunct original spring, the preserve opened in June as a $250 million attraction of exhibits, gardens and trails that illustrate the heritage and ecology of the Mojave Desert and Las Vegas.", 
                "\"The history of the city is the history of the water in this valley,\" said Marcel Parent, the preserve's education director.", 
                "Current casinos and hotels are also feeding most of the water they use back into the Las Vegas Wash, which feeds recycled water back to Lake Mead.", 
                "The gaming and hospitality industries, which account for only 3 percent of the area's overall water use, are generally pretty good stewards, authority officials say.", 
                "And, of course, they drive the area's economy.", 
                "Tourists aren't drawn to casinos only for the gambling.", 
                "Sometimes, it's all about the show.", 
                "At the Golden Nugget, an older hotel and casino in downtown Las Vegas, a Michigan mother waited for a hamburger at a grill.", 
                "During three days in town with her grown daughter, she had been in almost every casino on the Strip.", 
                "The neon and noise had left her unimpressed.", 
                "But she said she would cherish one experience - watching the Bellagio's fountain shooting water to the heavens as Elvis sang.", 
                "That, she said, was worth the trip.",

                "Facing the worst drought in a century and the prospect that climate change could yield long-term changes on the Colorado River, the lifeline for several Western states, federal officials have reached a new pact with the states on how to allocate water if the river runs short.", 
                "State and federal officials praised the agreement, which Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne was expected to sign Thursday, as a landmark akin to the Colorado River Compact of 1922 that first divvied up how much water the seven states served by the river -- California, Nevada, Arizona, Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, and Wyoming -- receive annually.", 
                "The new accord, outlined by federal officials in a telephone news conference Friday, spells out how three down-river states, California, Arizona and Nevada, will share the pain of river shortages.", 
                "It puts in place new measures to encourage conservation and manage the two primary reservoirs, Lake Mead and Lake Powell, which have gone from nearly full to just about half empty since 1999.", 
                "The accord is expected to forestall litigation that was likely to have arisen as fast-growing states jockey for the best way to keep the water flowing to their residents and businesses in increasingly dry times.", 
                "It would be in effect through 2026 and could be revised during that time.", 
                "Some environmental groups said the pact did not go far enough to encourage conservation and discourage growth.", 
                "But federal officials said they took the best of several proposals by the states, environmental organizations and others and emphasized the importance of all seven states agreeing with the result.", 
                "\"I think for the first time in 85 years we are on the same page,\" said Herb Guenther, the director of water resources in Arizona, which had initially balked at some terms of the agreement and was threatening legal action over it.", 
                "But with water levels in reservoirs dropping, a record eight-year drought, the prospect that climate change could bring more dry spells and new scientific analyses suggesting the West could be drier than has been traditionally believed, the states were pushed to act.", 
                "These factors \"forced the issue to the head and we decided to do something unique and different,\" Guenther said.", 
                "The agreement, the product of two-and-a-half years of negotiation and study, establishes criteria for the Interior Department to declare a shortage on the river, which would occur when the system is unable to produce the 7.5 million acre-feet of water, enough to supply 15 million homes for a year, that the three down river states are entitled to.", 
                "Water deliveries would be decreased based on how far water levels drop in Lake Mead and Lake Powell.", 
                "The Bureau of Reclamation, which manages the river system, predicts about a 5 percent chance of such a shortage being declared by 2010, but it all depends on how much the states are able to conserve and, of course, the weather.", 
                "The probability projection \"does not imply it can't happen,\" said Terry Fulp, a bureau official involved in managing the river.", 
                "Water districts, anticipating an eventual cutback of Colorado River water, have been storing large amounts of water and the accord encourages them to continue to do so.", 
                "The pact includes a bundle of agreements with the states, including approval for water managers in the Las Vegas area, which gets 90 percent of its water from the Colorado, to get a greater share of Lake Mead water in exchange for financing a reservoir in California to capture large amounts of river water destined for Mexico but beyond that country's entitlement by treaty.", 
                "\"It's hugely important for us,\" said Scott Huntley, a spokesman for the Southern Nevada Water Authority.", 
                "\"This really does provide the bridge for us to get into the next decade.", 
                "\" But John Weisheit, conservation director for Living Rivers, a Utah-based environmental group, said the agreement sends the message to the states that growth trumps sensible water management.", 
                "Weisheit said the conservation should have been stressed and the government's computer modeling was overly optimistic about future water supply.", 
                "\"There is more water on paper than there actually is on the landscape,\" he said.", 
                "\"They are looking at this in a way that will allow more development even though the water is not theoretically there."

                "The shortage guidelines, more than two years in the making, come in the eighth year of the worst drought in the century-long historic record of the Colorado, which supplies water to 25 million people and 1 million acres of farmland.", 
                "Federal water managers say a shortage could be declared as early as 2010, allowing the Department of the Interior to reduce water deliveries to Arizona and Nevada, two of the seven states that have sparred over the waterway for decades.", 
                "California, which has the biggest water allocation and seniority rights in the Lower Basin, would not be affected.", 
                "The ongoing drought has left Lake Powell and Lake Mead, the Colorado's two mammoth reservoirs, half empty, their receding shorelines marked by a wide band of bleached rocks that a decade ago were under water.", 
                "Without some very wet years, Lake Mead might never refill, according to federal hydrologists.", 
                "\"We have had good news and bad news,\" said U.S. Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthorne in a speech before signing the shortage document at the Colorado River Water Users Association meeting at Caesars Palace.", 
                "The bad news, he added, is that the Colorado drought shows \"no sign of ending.", 
                "\" Scientists also predict that climate change will worsen Western drought patterns and reduce Colorado flows by increasing evaporation and decreasing snowfall.", 
                "One study released earlier in 2007 warned that global warming could thrust the Southwest into a state of permanent drought by 2050.", 
                "\"Runoff in five of the seven Colorado River basin states is projected to decline by more than 15 percent during the 21st century,\" Kempthorne said.", 
                "Against that backdrop, Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona and California began negotiations in 2005 to write a blueprint for water shortages.", 
                "Their plans formed the basis of the document signed by Kempthorne, who called it \"an agreement to share adversity\" and a landmark in the tangled history of Colorado River management.", 
                "The agreement avoided a prolonged legal battle among the seven states by tinkering with river law without changing the fundamentals of the 1922 compact that divided the Colorado's flow among them.", 
                "Although California's seniority rights put it in the best position of the Lower Basin states, the agreement benefited the state by preventing \"bloody legal fights in Congress or the courts,\" said Jeffrey Kightlinger, general manager of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California.", 
                "The guidelines, which will be in effect for the next 19 years, contain three major elements: -- They set particular water-level elevations of Lake Mead as triggers for water cutbacks.", 
                "The reductions will total less than 10 percent of the Lower Basin's allocation.",

                "It's entitlement is not impacted,\" said Bill Swan, water rights attorney for the Imperial Irrigation District, which gets three-fourths of California's Colorado allotment.", 
                "-- Lake Powell, which holds water from the upper-basin states, and Lake Mead, which receives water from Powell, will be operated as one reservoir system.", 
                "That is expected to make it easier to control Mead's level and the shortage triggers.", 
                "-- States will be allowed to hold \"conserved\" water in Mead from year to year, changing existing rules that require them to use or lose their annual allocations.", 
                "Water agencies then could pay irrigation districts to let farmland lie fallow, keep the unused irrigation water stored in Mead and draw on it at a later date.", 
                "The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California will be able to store up to 1.5 million acre-feet in Mead, nearly double the capacity of its Diamond Valley Lake Reservoir in Riverside County.", 
                "That is enough water to meet annual needs for about 3 million average households.", 
                "Nevada, which has the smallest water allotment in the Lower Basin, plans to hold water in Mead from fallow farmland along the Virgin and Muddy rivers.", 
                "The Southern Nevada Water Authority also will build a small reservoir, called Drop Two, near the Mexican border to capture flows ordered by U.S. farmers who don't use it during rain.", 
                "That measure would decrease flows to the Colorado's ecologically important delta, potentially sparking outcry from Mexico.", 
                "In return for financing the reservoir, Southern Nevada will get some of the captured water.",

                "Michael Cohen, senior associate for the Pacific Institute, called the agreement a large step forward.",
