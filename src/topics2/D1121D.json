                "The grisly allegations detailed in an 18-page indictment sparked protests by animal rights groups at the headquarters of the NFL and the Falcons, and NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has barred Vick from training camp while the league investigates.", 
                "Falcons owner Arthur Blank said the team wanted to suspend Vick for four games, the maximum penalty a team can assess a player, but the NFL asked him to wait.", 
                "Instead, Blank has told his embattled player to focus on his legal problems, not football.", 
                "The case began April 25 when investigators conducting a drug search at the home found 66 dogs, including 55 pit bulls, and equipment typically used in dogfighting.", 
                "Items such as a \"rape stand\" that holds aggressive dogs in place for mating and a \"breakstick\" used to pry open a dog's mouth in a fight were seized.", 
                "Vick contended he knew nothing about a dogfighting operation at the home, where one of his cousins lived, and said he rarely visited.", 
                "He has since declined comment, citing his attorney's advice.", 
                "Attorney Lawrence Woodward of Virginia Beach, who has also represented Allen Iverson and Vick's younger brother, Marcus, has not returned several phone messages.", 
                "Animal rights organizations have seized on the case as an opportunity to raise awareness of the largely underground and always gruesome world of dogfighting, where dogs are trained to fight to the death.", 
                "Five hours before Vick's scheduled arraignment, animal rights activists, supporters of the athlete and the media gathered early Thursday outside the federal courthouse.", 
                "About 40 people began queuing for a seat in the courtroom or an overflow courtroom.", 
                "Some members of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals dressed in dog costumes and carried signs, including one with the image of a battered pit bull and the words \"Dogfighting Victim.", 
                "\" A trio of supporters from Boston wearing Vick's No.", 
                "7 jersey and Atlanta Falcons' hats made the nine-hour trip south to support Vick.", 
                "According to the indictment filed July 17, dogs not killed in the fighting pit were often shot, hanged, drowned or, in one case, slammed to the ground.", 
                "The document alleges that Vick was consulted before one losing dog was wet down and electrocuted.", 
                "It alleges that the dogfighting operation began in 2001, not long after Vick parlayed a dazzling two-year run as the quarterback at Virginia Tech into the first overall selection in the NFL Draft.", 
                "His first contract was for $62 million.", 
                "In 2004, he signed a 10-year, $130 million deal, then the richest in league history.", 
                "The indictment alleges the fights offered purses as high as $26,000, and Vick once paid $23,000 to the owner of two pit bulls that had beaten Bad Newz Kennels dogs.",

                "Cox News Service RICHMOND, Va. ?- The bad news keeps piling up for Falcons quarterback Michael Vick - one of his co-defendants in the federal dog fighting case pleaded guilty Monday and signed a document alleging the charges against Vick and two others are true.", 
                "Tony Taylor, who along with Vick pleaded not guilty to the charges just four days ago, has promised to cooperate with federal prosecutors and share \"detailed facts\" for their case against Vick and two other co-defendants, Purnell Peace and Quanis Phillips.", 
                "Taylor also signed a 13-page statement of facts outlining the charges against him, Vick and the two others, stating they are \"true and accurate\" and that had Taylor's case gone to trial prosecutors could have proven \"these facts beyond a reasonable doubt.", 
                "\" Judge Henry E. Hudson set Taylor's sentencing date for Dec. 14.", 
                "Vick, Peace and Phillips' trial date is still set for Nov. 26 before Hudson.", 
                "They face up to five years in prison and $250,000 in fines.", 
                "Prosecutors could recommend a lighter sentence for Taylor depending on how cooperative he is, legal experts said, and that is why the court set Taylor's sentencing for a date after the trial.", 
                "\"(Taylor) has all these incentives to cooperate fully with the government in order to reduce his possible exposure to a sentence and a fine,\" said Carl Tobias, a University of Richmond law professor who specializes in Constitutional law and the federal courts.", 
                "\"You have to give up everything\" as part of a plea deal, said David P. Baugh, a former federal prosecutor and now a criminal defense attorney who has represented clients before Hudson.", 
                "\"There are no non-snitching plea agreements.", 
                "He probably has already been debriefed.", 
                "\" Taylor, 34, of Hampton, Va., said little in court during his 15-minute long hearing Monday.", 
                "He and his attorney, Stephen A. Hudgins, declined to comment as they left the courthouse.", 
                "A spokesman for Vick also declined to comment.", 
                "A federal grand jury indicted Taylor, Vick and the two others this month on a single count of conspiring to violate three laws: the interstate travel act by crossing state lines to engage in illegal gambling; sponsoring a dog in an animal fighting venture; and buying, transporting and receiving dogs for animal fighting.", 
                "Taylor pleaded guilty Monday to conspiring to travel in interstate commerce in aid of unlawful activities and to sponsor a dog in an animal fighting venture.", 
                "Here are some of the key facts Taylor agreed to in his plea deal when he signed a statement of facts with federal prosecutors: -- Taylor, Vick, Peace and Phillips set up a business called \"Bad Newz Kennels\" in rural Surry County, Va. to raise and train pit bulls for dogfights; -- The men gambled on the fights in Virginia and several other states.", 
                "Vick, an ex-Virginia Tech football star who now has a $130 million contract with the Falcons, sponsored dogs in fights with purses as low as $3,000; -- Vick almost exclusively funded the dog-fighting operation and gambling monies.", 
                "And the proceeds from the gambling wins were split by Taylor, Phillips and Peace; -- At various times, Taylor, Peace and Phillips executed dogs they didn't think would fight well by shooting them.", 
                "Taylor electrocuted one dog in 2002.", 
                "At Vick and Taylor's arraignment Thursday, prosecutors announced they would be seeking a \"superceding\" indictment before the end of August, meaning they could identify additional charges or defendants in the case.", 
                "Taylor's plea hearing showed up on Hudson's schedule the following day.", 
                "\"There certainly looks like there might be some linkage,\" said Tobias, the University of Richmond law professor.", 
                "\"He may have been afraid of what might be in that superceding indictment.", 
                "\" Taylor played a key role in the dog fighting operation in May of 2001, federal prosecutors say, by identifying the Surry County property as a suitable location for housing and training the dogs.", 
                "Vick bought the property the following month.", 
                "In June of 2002, Taylor signed the articles of incorporation as the organizer for a business based at that Surry County property called MV7 LLC.", 
                "MV7 - Vick's initials and jersey number - owned another business called Mike Vick K-9 Kennels, according to its old Web site.", 
                "And between 2003 and 2006, Surry County issued three pet licenses in Taylor's name to house between 30 and 50 dogs on Vick's property.", 
                "Peace's name also is on one of the licenses.", 
                "Taylor confirmed in the statement of facts he signed with federal prosecutors that he used a large portion of his gambling winnings from the dogfights for living expenses because he devoted his time to caring for and training the pit bulls.", 
                "The document says Taylor left the business after a disagreement with Phillips and others in September of 2004.", 
                "Taylor has had other run-ins with the law.", 
                "In 1992, he received a two-year sentence in the Bronx on a drug-trafficking charge.", 
                "He served seven months in a New York state prison before being released on parole on Feb. 18, 1993.", 
                "He was released from parole supervision in May 1996.", 
                "Later that year, police in Newport News arrested him on a cocaine possession charge.", 
                "The case was dismissed after he completed a substance abuse program.", 
                "More recently, Taylor has lived in Atlanta.", 
                "On April 10, police arrested him on a domestic violence battery charge.", 
                "He was released on $500 bond the same day.", 
                "As for Vick, he got hit with more bad news last week when the NFL told him to stay away from training camp while it investigates the charges.", 
                "Also last week, Nike suspended Vick's endorsement contract without pay and Reebok halted sales of jerseys bearing his name.", 
                "In another development Monday, a group that organized a rally in support of Vick last weekend called for a national boycott of Nike, Reebok and any other corporate sponsors that have severed ties with Vick.", 
                "\"All of the people that have dropped him before his day in court,\" said Gerald Rose, founder and CEO of New Order National Human Rights Organization based in Marietta, Ga., \"we're saying don't patronize them until the trial is over and the verdict is read.",
