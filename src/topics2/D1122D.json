                "Aamodt noted that many other bridges around the country carry the same designation that the I-35W bridge received.", 
                "She declined to say what the agency was going to do to address the deficiencies found in 2005.", 
                "Road crews were working on the bridge's joints, guardrails and lights this week, with lane closures overnight on Tuesday and Wednesday.", 
                "The bridge was fitted in 2001 with a computerized anti-icing system that sprayed chemicals on the surface during winter weather, according to documents posted on the Minnesota Department of Transportation's Web site.", 
                "There were 18 construction workers on the bridge at the time of the collapse, said Tom Sloan, head of the bridge division for Progressive Contractors Inc., in St. Michael.", 
                "One of the workers was unaccounted for.", 
                "Sloan said his crew was placing concrete finish on the bridge for what he called a routine resurfacing project.", 
                "\"It was the final item on this phase of the project.", 
                "Suddenly the bridge gave way,\" he said.", 
                "Sloan said his workers described a horrific scene.", 
                "\"They said they basically rode the bridge down to the water.", 
                "They were sliding into cars and cars were sliding into them,\" he said.", 
                "The entire span of Interstate 35W crumpled into the river below.", 
                "Some injured people were carried up the riverbank, while emergency workers tended to others on the ground.", 
                "A school bus had crossed the bridge before it collapsed.", 
                "The bus did not go into the water, and broadcast reports indicated the children on the bus exited out the back door.", 
                "Senator Norm Coleman of Minnesota said he spoke with Transportation Secretary Mary Peters, and that both of them along with Minnesota's other senator, Amy Klobuchar, will be flying to Minneapolis early Thursday.", 
                "The collapsed bridge stood just blocks from the heart of Minneapolis, near tourist attractions like the new Guthrie Theater and the Stone Arch Bridge.", 
                "As the steamy night progressed massive crowds of onlookers circulated in the area on foot or bicycle, some of them after departing Wednesday night's game at the nearby Metrodome early.", 
                "The steel-arched bridge, which was built in 1967, rose about 64 feet (19.5 meters) above the river and stretched about 1,900 feet (580 meters) across the water.", 
                "The bridge was built with a single 458-foot-long (140-meter-long) steel arch to avoid putting any piers in the water that might interfere with river navigation.", 
                "The river's depth at the bridge was not immediately available, but the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers maintains a channel depth of at least 9 feet (2.74 meters) in the Upper Mississippi from Minneapolis southward to allow for barge and other river traffic.", 
                "The site is just downstream from the St. Anthony Falls locks and dams.", 
                "------ Associated Press Writers Brian Bakst and Patrick Condon contributed to this report from Minneapolis; Martiga Lohn contributed to this report from St. Paul."

                "As many as 50 cars plummeted more than 60 feet (18.29 meters) into the river, some falling on top one of another.", 
                "A train had been passing beneath the roadway at the time it fell, and a school bus, which had just crossed the bridge, sat on the angled concrete.", 
                "In the river, divers were checking for bodies and taking down license plate numbers for authorities to track down the vehicles' owners.", 
                "Getting the vehicles out was expected to take several days and involve moving around very large, heavy pieces of bridge.", 
                "\"The bridge is still shifting,\" Dolan said.", 
                "\"We're dealing with the Mississippi River.", 
                "We're dealing with currents.", 
                "We're going to have to do it slowly and safely.", 
                "\" He said police estimate that 20 to 30 people were unaccounted for, though he stressed that it was just an estimate.", 
                "The depth of the water underneath the bridge is between 4 to 14 feet (1.2 to 4.3 meters), according to the Army Corps of Engineers.", 
                "Following the collapse, some who were able to escape scrambled to shore and some survivors carried the injured up the riverbank for medical help.", 
                "Others jumped into the water to search for more survivors.", 
                "At Hennepin County Medical Center, patients had arrived in a steady stream after the collapse, some unconscious or moaning, some barely breathing, others with serious head and back injuries, Dr. William Heegaard said.", 
                "\"There was blood everywhere,\" he said.", 
                "Relatives who could not find their loved ones at hospitals gathered in a hotel ballroom Thursday morning for any news, hoping for the best.", 
                "Authorities initially said at least seven people had died, but Police Lt. Amelia Huffman lowered that number Thursday morning, saying, \"The medical examiner's office only has four sets of remains.", 
                "\" She said the initial reports were based on the best estimates authorities had.", 
                "The first step of the federal investigation will be to recover pieces of the bridge and reassemble them, kind of like a jigsaw puzzle, to try and determine what happened, National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Mark Rosenker said.", 
                "Investigators also want to review video of the collapse, and were setting up a phone number for witnesses to call with information.", 
                "As the divers worked their way around at least a dozen submerged vehicles, Transportation Secretary Mary Peters announced a $5 million (euro3.66 million) grant to help pay for rerouting traffic patterns around the disaster site.", 
                "\"We fully understand what happened and we will take every step possible to ensure something like this will not happen again,\" Peters said.", 
                "Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat, said up to $100 million (euro73 million) in federal funds will also be available for rebuilding and recovery.", 
                "\"A bridge in America just shouldn't fall down,\" Klobuchar said.", 
                "\"That's why we have called for this investigation.", 
                "\" Bush also pledged the government's help.", 
                "\"We in the federal government must respond, and respond robustly, to help the people there not only recover, but to make sure that lifeline of activity -- that bridge -- gets rebuilt as quickly as possible,\" he said in Washington.", 
                "In 2005, the 40-year-old bridge had been rated as \"structurally deficient\" and possibly in need of replacement, according to a federal database.", 
                "The span rated 50 on a scale of 120 for structural stability in that review, White House press secretary Tony Snow said.", 
                "\"This doesn't mean there was a risk of failure, but if an inspection report identifies deficiencies, the state is responsible for taking corrective actions,\" he said.", 
                "The U.S. Department of Transportation's inspector general last year criticized the Federal Highway Administration's oversight of interstate bridges, saying investigators found incorrect or outdated maximum weight limit calculations and weight limit postings in the National Bridge Inventory and in states' bridge databases.", 
                "Incorrect load ratings could endanger bridges by allowing heavier vehicles to cross than should be allowed, the inspector general said.", 
                "The audit did not identify any Minnesota bridges beyond noting that 3 percent of the state's bridges were structurally deficient, placing it at the low end among states.", 
                "Pawlenty, the state's governor, said Thursday that there was no indication from that and other reviews that the bridge should be shut down.", 
                "Peters added that \"none of those ratings indicated there was any kind of danger.", 
                "\" This week, road crews had been working on the bridge's joints, guardrails and lights, with lane closures overnight on Tuesday and Wednesday.", 
                "In 2001, the bridge had been fitted with a computerized anti-icing system that sprayed chemicals on the surface during winter weather, according to documents posted on the Minnesota Department of Transportation's Web site.", 
                "Wednesday evening, 18 construction workers were on the bridge when it collapsed, said Tom Sloan, head of the bridge division for Progressive Contractors Inc., in St. Michael.", 
                "The crew was placing concrete finish on the bridge for what he called a routine resurfacing project.", 
                "\"It was the final item on this phase of the project.", 
                "Suddenly the bridge gave way,\" he said.", 
                "\"They said they basically rode the bridge down to the water.", 
                "They were sliding into cars and cars were sliding into them,\" he said.", 
                "One of the workers was unaccounted for, he said.", 
                "The school bus had just crossed the bridge when the entire span of Interstate 35W crumpled into the river below.", 
                "The bus stayed on concrete, and the children were able to escape unharmed out the back door.", 
                "Christine Swift's 10-year-old daughter, Kaleigh, was on the bus, returning from a field trip to Bunker Hills in Blaine.", 
                "She said her daughter called her about 6:10 p.m. \"She was screaming, 'The bridge collapsed,'\" Swift said.", 
                "All the children got off the bus safely, but about 10 of the children were injured, officials said.", 
                "The collapsed bridge is just blocks from the heart of Minneapolis, near tourist attractions like the new Guthrie Theater and the Stone Arch Bridge.", 
                "As the steamy night progressed massive crowds of onlookers circulated in the area on foot or bicycle, some of them wearing Twins T-shirts and caps after departing Wednesday night's game at the nearby Metrodome early.", 
                "Thursday's game between the Twins and Kansas City Royals was called off, but the Twins decided to go ahead with Wednesday's rather than sending about 25,000 fans back out onto the congested highways.", 
                "Inside the stadium, there was a moment of silence to honor victims.", 
                "The steel-arched bridge, built in 1967, rose 64 feet (19.5 meters) above the river and stretched 1,900 feet (579 meters) across the water.", 
                "It was built with a single 458-foot-long (140-meter) steel arch to avoid the need for piers that might interfere with river navigation.",

                "First lady Laura Bush will visit Minneapolis on Friday to console victims of the disaster.", 
                "The U.S. House Transportation Committee quickly approved legislation Thursday that would direct $250 million (euro183 million) to Minnesota to help it replace the bridge.", 
                "But in the Senate, Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Democrat, said it was too soon to approve emergency funding for a new bridge because it is unclear how much will be needed.", 
                "Congress recesses for its August vacation on Friday.", 
                "The White House said a U.S. inspection of the 40-year-old bridge in 2005 found problems.", 
                "The Interstate 35W span rated 50 on a scale of 100 for structural stability and was classified as \"structurally deficient,\" transportation officials said.", 
                "The designation means some portions of the bridge needed to be scheduled for repair or replacement, and it was on a schedule for inspection every two years.", 
                "\"It didn't mean that the bridge is unsafe,\" Transportation Secretary Mary Peters said.", 
                "Earlier, at the White House, press secretary Tony Snow said while the inspection did not indicate the bridge was at risk of failing, \"If an inspection report identifies deficiencies, the state is responsible for taking corrective actions.", 
                "Tim Pawlenty on Thursday ordered an immediate inspection of all bridges in the state with similar designs, but said the state was never warned that the bridge needed to be closed or immediately repaired.", 
                "Another inspection was scheduled for completion in September.", 
                "\"There was no call by anyone that we're aware of that said it should be immediately closed or immediately replaced,\" Pawlenty said.", 
                "\"It was more of a monitor, inspect, maintain, and potentially replace it in the future.", 
                "\" Later Thursday, officials alerted states to immediately inspect all steel-deck truss bridges similar to the one that collapsed in Minneapolis bridge.", 
                "There are approximately 700 such spans, according to U.S. Transportation Department spokesman Brian Turmail.", 
                "Governors across America scrambled Thursday to conduct bridge inspections, ordering engineers to review the safety of thousands of structures.", 
                "Nearly 13 percent of America's bridges were classified as \"structurally deficient\" in 2004, meaning they are deteriorating, according to a report issued by the Federal Highway Administration.", 
                "That was 75,422 bridges out of about 600,000 nationwide.", 
                "In the Mississippi River, divers took down license plate numbers for authorities to track down the vehicles' owners.", 
                "Getting the vehicles out was expected to take several days and involve moving around very large, heavy pieces of bridge.", 
                "Relatives who could not find their loved ones at hospitals gathered in a hotel ballroom Thursday for any news, hoping for the best.", 
                "As many as 50 vehicles tumbled into the river when the bridge collapsed, leaving those who could escape to scramble to shore.", 
                "Some survivors carried the injured up the riverbank, while emergency workers tended to others on the ground and some jumped into the water to look for survivors.", 
                "Fire and black smoke rose from the wreckage.", 
                "\"People who were pinned or partly crushed told emergency workers to say 'hello' or say 'goodbye' to their loved ones,\" Dolan said.", 
                "Aron Dahlgren, 23, a University of Minnesota graduate student, was driving to his girlfriend's home when the bridge began to fall.", 
                "He noticed overhead road signs in front of him start to sink -- and then his car plummeted.", 
                "\"That's the longest two or three seconds of your life,\" Dahlgren said.", 
                "\"That was the scariest place.", 
                "I kept on thinking -- I kept on questioning, was this how I was going to die.", 
                "If I'd have left 30 seconds earlier, I'd have been over the water.", 
                "\" The first step of the federal investigation will be to recover pieces of the bridge and reassemble them, much like a jigsaw puzzle, to try and determine what happened, NTSB Chairman Mark Rosenker said.", 
                "Investigators also want to review video of the collapse.", 
                "Engineers spotted structural problems in the bridge as far back as 1990, but state officials thought patches and yearly inspections would be enough to keep it together, Minnesota's top bridge engineer said.", 
                "This year's inspection started in June and would have been finished in September after $2.4 million (euro1.76 million) worth of maintenance on the deck, joints, guardrails and lights.", 
                "\"We thought we had done all we could.", 
                "Obviously something went terribly wrong,\" state bridge engineer Dan Dorgan said.", 
                "The steel-arched bridge, built in 1967, rose 64 feet (19.5 meters) above the river and stretched 1,900 feet (579 meters) across the water.", 
                "It was built with a single 458-foot(140-meter)-long steel arch to avoid the need for piers that might interfere with river navigation.",
