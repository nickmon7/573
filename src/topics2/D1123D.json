                "Arson attacks against \"imperialist\" and \"capitalist\" targets continued from a variety of small groups, but in 2003 a new outfit emerged with the know-how to carry out more destructive strikes: Revolutionary Struggle (EA).", 
                "On Friday, the Greek authorities said they were investigating a claim that the rocket attack was also carried out by this extreme left-wing group.", 
                "\"It is probably domestic activity... as is seen from the apparent assumption of responsibility by Revolutionary Struggle,\" said Public Order Minister Vyron Polydoras, adding that the attack constituted \"an attempt to revive terrorist (activity)\" which would fail.", 
                "The previously unknown group drew blood with its first attack in 2003, injuring a police officer in two explosions at the Athens court complex where members of November 17 were on trial at the time.", 
                "The new group's most brazen coup came in May 2004, when three homemade bombs exploded outside an Athens district police station at a time of high security for the Athens Games, an attack timed to coincide with the 100-day countdown to the Olympics.", 
                "Revolutionary Struggle last struck in May 2005, when it placed an explosive device near the home of former public order minister George Voulgarakis to protest his role in \"the Greek state's involvement in the (US) war on terror.", 
                "\" Polydoras added that the Friday rocket attack -- which was apparently aimed at the embassy's eagle emblem -- was a \"symbolic\" gesture.", 
                "November 17 itself fired a rocket against the US embassy in 1996.", 
                "In total, the group killed five Americans -- including the CIA station chief in Athens -- during its 27-year reign of terror.", 
                "Sixteen of its members have been sentenced to heavy prison sentences and are currently on appeals trial.", 
                "With the Greek extreme left seeking to fill the gap left by the demise of November 17 and ELA, the country's security forces have also sought to step up surveillance activities.", 
                "But they have run afoul of public opinion, which is particularly sensitive to any loss of personal freedom after the excesses of the Colonels' Junta from 1967 to 1974.", 
                "\"The legislative corps does not help the police,\" noted a Western diplomat.",
