                "An Indonesian minister claimed Wednesday that a vast \"mud volcano\" which has inundated villages on the island of Java was a \"natural disaster\" unrelated to the drilling activities of a company controlled by his family.", 
                "A gas well near Surabaya in East Java operated by Lapindo Brantas Inc. has spewed steaming mud since May last year, submerging villages, industries and fields.", 
                "Coordinating Minister for Social Welfare Aburizal Bakrie has said little about the environmental disaster and his explanation at a Jakarta Foreign Correspondents' Club lunch was questioned by journalists and diplomats.", 
                "According to most experts, Lapindo Brantas Inc., owned by the Bakrie Group controlled by the minister's family, made a serious technical error in its exploratory drilling by not taking measures to prevent the possible escape of liquid or gas under pressure.", 
                "By breaking through a layer containing hydrogen sulphide, the drilling allowed hot mud to rise and escape.", 
                "But Bakrie claimed nothing could have prevented the disaster, quoting \"international and national experts,\" and instead blamed it on an earthquake hundreds of kilometres from the site of the mud flow.", 
                "\"It is not because of the Lapindo drill case but it is because of the quake,\" he said, referring to the May 27 quake near the ancient city of Yogyakarta which killed around 6,000 people.", 
                "Bakrie also said the mud, which has forced 13,000 people to flee and continues to spread, was not toxic and could be dumped in the sea without concern.", 
                "\"The mud is the sea mud,\" he said, adding it was laid down at a time in geological history when the area was covered by the sea.", 
                "\"They (the mud) are moving back from the (current) place to their original place,\" Barie said.", 
                "\"It does not kill the fish,\" he said.", 
                "\"It will not endanger the shrimp industry.", 
                "\" United Nations experts however predicted in a report that the sudden influx of mud in the sea would destroy the marine ecosystem.", 
                "Environment Minister Rachmat Witoelar has said it could take years before the mud stops flowing.", 
                "President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono last month ordered Lapindo to pay 3.8 trillion rupiah (420.7 million dollars) in compensation and costs related to the mud flow."

                "A mud volcano that has erupted in Indonesia, forcing the evacuation of thousands of villagers, was most probably caused by drilling for gas, according to the first published scientific study into the phenomenon.", 
                "The eruption \"appears to have been triggered by drilling of overpressured porous and permeable limestones at depth of around 2,830 metres (7,735 feet) below the surface,\" says the study, conducted by British experts and published in a US journal.", 
                "It adds that the volcano has been disgorging between 7,000 and 150,000 cubic metres (245,000 and 5.25 million cubic feet) of mud every day.", 
                "Such pressures, coupled to the local geology, suggest the flow \"will continue for many months and possibly years to come,\" it warns.", 
                "In the coming months, sag-like subsidence several kilometers (miles) wide will occur, and around the main vent there is likely to be \"more dramatic collapse,\" forming a crater, it adds.", 
                "An area of at least 10 square kilometers (3.9 square miles) around the volcano will be uninhabitable for years, and over 11,000 people will be permanently displaced, it says.", 
                "The research is conducted by a team led by Richard Davies, a professor at the University of Durham's Centre for Research into Earth Energy Systems in northeastern England.", 
                "It appears in the February issue of GSA Today, a peer-assessed journal of the Geological Society of America (GSA).", 
                "The volcano, known locally as \"Lusi,\" has been spewing steaming mud since May 29 last year, submerging four villages, fields and factories.", 
                "It erupted from a gas well near Surabaya, East Java, that was operated by Lapindo Brantas Inc. As many as 13,000 people have fled their homes.", 
                "The British experts analysed satellite images of the area to make their study.", 
                "They say that seepage of mud and water are usually a preventable hazard when exploring for oil and gas.", 
                "\"It is standard industry procedure that this kind of drilling requires the use of steel casing to support the borehole, to protect against the pressure of fluids such as water, oil or gas,\" Davies said in a press release.", 
                "\"In the case of Lusi, a pressured limestone rock containing water -- a water aquifer -- was drilled while the lower part of the borehole was exposed and not protected by casing.", 
                "\"As a result, rocks fractured and a mix of mud and water worked its way to the surface.", 
                "Our research brings us to the conclusion that the incident was most probably the result of drilling.", 
                "\" Davies said the case in Indonesia was similar to a blowout that happened offshore of Brunei in 1979.", 
                "\"Just as is most probably the case with Lusi, the Brunei event was caused by drilling and it took an international oil company almost 30 years and 20 relief wells and monitoring before the eruption stopped,\" he added.", 
                "Last week, Indonesia's coordinating minister for social welfare, Aburizal Bakrie, whose family firm controls Lapindo Brantas, said the volcano was a \"natural disaster\" unrelated to the drilling activities.", 
                "\"It is not because of the Lapindo drill case but it is because of the quake,\" he said, referring to a May 27 temblor near the ancient city of Yogyakarta that killed around 6,000 people.", 
                "But this scenario is ruled out by the study.", 
                "It concludes that the quake was not to blame, mainly because two days elapsed before mud volcano erupted, and no other mud volcanoes occurred in the region after the temblor.", 
                "President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono last month ordered Lapindo to pay 3.8 trillion rupiah (420.7 million dollars) in compensation and costs related to the mud flow."

                "Indonesian authorities Wednesday postponed the start of an attempt to slow a massive mudflow which has swallowed villages by plugging the crater with chains of concrete balls.", 
                "A gas well near Surabaya in East Java has spewed steaming mud since May last year, submerging villages, factories and fields and forcing more than 15,000 people to flee their homes.", 
                "The attempt to plug the \"mud volcano\" involves dropping hundreds of concrete balls chained together in groups into the well, which is operated by PT Lapindo Brantas.", 
                "\"We are still not ready with all the necessary preparations and now it looks like the operation will only be possible on Friday at the earliest,\" Rudi Novrianto, spokesman for the government team handling the crisis, told AFP.", 
                "He said the crane which will lift the balls and drop them into the crater was not yet in place.", 
                "Novrianto has said the team planned to gradually drop about 375 chains of linked balls of differing sizes, each chain weighing between 400 and 500 kilograms (880 to 1,100 pounds).", 
                "The concrete balls, devised by experts at the state-run Bandung Institute of Technology, are expected to still allow the mud to flow out, but at a much reduced volume.", 
                "The team hopes to slow down the outflow by between 50 and 70 percent.", 
                "The advancing sea of mud has blocked a nearby main road and is now threatening to swamp a key railway, which is to be rerouted away from the danger zone.", 
                "However several geologists, including Edi Sunardi from the University of Pajajaran, have said the scheme will likely fail.", 
                "\"We are looking at a plane, and you cannot plug such a plane with concrete balls,\" Sunardi said, adding that the pressure may even push the balls back to the surface.", 
                "Top welfare minister Aburizal Bakrie claimed last month that the flow was a \"natural disaster\" unrelated to the drilling activities of Lapindo, which belongs to a group controlled by his family.", 
                "However, a study by British experts said the eruption was most likely caused by drilling for gas.", 
                "President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has already ordered Lapindo to pay 3.8 trillion rupiah (420 million dollars) in compensation and costs related to the disaster."
