                "It happened midway through his news conference in the Rose Garden Thursday morning, in between his 10th and 11th mentions of al-Qaida: A bird flew over the president and deposited a wet, white dropping on the upper left sleeve of his jacket.", 
                "Bush wiped the mess off with his bare hand.", 
                "There was no evidence that Osama bin Laden was responsible for this particular attack, and -- who knows?", 
                "-- maybe the terrorist leader believes the superstition that bird poop is good luck.", 
                "But just about everything else that came up during the hour-long news conference was traced to bin Laden's terrorist network.", 
                "The session was called to draw attention to the fact that Democratic leaders had just caved in to Bush's demand that the Iraq spending bill have no withdrawal timeline.", 
                "But as frequently happens at presidential events these days, it quickly became al-Qaida, all the time.", 
                "Bush invoked the terrorist group 19 times and even suggested it was going after individual reporters' kids.", 
                "``They are a threat to your children, David,'' he advised NBC's David Gregory.", 
                "``It's a danger to your children, Jim,'' Bush informed the New York Times' Jim Rutenberg.", 
                "This last warning was perplexing, because Rutenberg has no children, only a brown chow named Little Bear.", 
                "It was unclear whether Bush was referring to a specific and credible threat to Little Bear or merely indicating there was increased ``chatter in the system'' about chows in general.", 
                "Rutenberg, informed of the pet threat, asked Bush a follow-up question about bin Laden.", 
                "``Mr. President, why is he still at large?", 
                "'' ``Why is he at large?", 
                "'' Bush shot back.",

                "'' Hard to argue with that.", 
                "Even Steve Hadley, the poker-faced national security adviser, smiled.", 
                "And Bush proceeded to favor his listeners with more intelligence bulletins about the al-Qaeda leader.", 
                "``He's not out there traipsing around.", 
                "He's not leading many parades,'' the president reported.", 
                "``He's not out feeding the hungry.", 
                "'' Bush allowed himself only a brief gloat over the Democrats' surrender -- he showed only a hint of a smile when he noted that ``we removed the arbitrary timetables for withdrawal'' -- before moving on to outline the latest strategy in Iraq: targeting al-Qaida, of course.", 
                "He cited ``new opportunities to partner with local tribes to go after al-Qaida.", 
                "'' ``Is that a Plan B?", 
                "'' asked Jim Axelrod of CBS News.", 
                "``Actually, I would call that a plan recommended by Baker-Hamilton, so it would be a Plan B-H,'' Bush answered, then checked to see how his joke about the Iraq Study Group went over.", 
                "``You didn't like it?", 
                "'' Bush appeared to be in good spirits as he walked briskly across the lawn to the podium.", 
                "Once there, he casually slid his heel in and out of his shoe as he spoke.", 
                "He teased a reporter for wearing a loose necktie: ``Go ahead and take the tie off -- it's halfway down anyway.", 
                "'' His tone was jaunty, whether the topic was China (``They need to be eating U.S. beef.", 
                "It's good for them.", 
                "'') or allegations that Justice Department officials broke the law (``It's just grand political theater'').", 
                "He also showed a playful interpretation of history, observing at one point that ``the Middle East looked nice and cozy for a while.", 
                "'' But when it came to the terrorists, Bush spoke with the cool ruthlessness of a dissident shareholder at an annual meeting.", 
                "``We have had good success in the chief operating officer position of al-Qaeda,'' he reported.", 
                "The president displayed his legendary ability to stick to his message.", 
                "Five times, he offered a variation on his theme that war decisions belong to ``commanders on the ground, not politicians here in Washington.", 
                "'' Thrice, he offered a version of his al-Qaida theme: ``It's better to fight them there than here.", 
                "'' The repetition technique, as usual, prevented Bush's questioners from eliciting more specifics about the war.", 
                "CNN's Ed Henry asked why he ignored warnings that invading Iraq would help al-Qaida.", 
                "``We were warned about a lot of things,'' the president said before expanding anew on the al-Qaida threat.", 
                "``Al-Qaida's going to fight us wherever we are,'' he said.", 
                "``They want to establish a caliphate.", 
                "'' When NBC's Gregory asked Bush to explain why he's ``still a credible messenger on the war,'' the answer eventually arrived again at the al-Qaida threat: ``They're dangerous.", 
                "And I can't put it any more plainly: They're dangerous.", 
                "'' After several such iterations of the threat, the Times' Rutenberg asked Bush to be philosophical about bin Laden.", 
                "``What do you think your own reaction would have been five years ago had you been told that toward the end of your term he would still be at large with that kind of capability, from Iraq no less?", 
                "'' The answer went back to another restatement of the threat.", 
                "``We are under threat,'' the president said.", 
                "``Now some may say, `Well, he's just saying that, you know, to get people to pay attention to him, or try to scare them for some reason.", 
                "' You know, I would hope our world hadn't become so cynical that they don't take the threats of al-Qaida seriously, because they're real."

                "\" The signing ceremony by Bush and Maliki marks the adoption of the Status of Forces Agreement approved by Iraq's parliament in November after months of political wrangling.", 
                "The pact will govern the presence of 146,000 US troops at more than 400 bases when their UN mandate expires at the end of the year, giving the Iraqi government veto power over virtually all of their operations.", 
                "Gates, who Obama has picked to stay on at the Pentagon in the new administration, told US troops on Saturday: \"We are in the process of the drawdown.", 
                "\" \"We are, I believe, in terms of the American commitment, in the endgame here in Iraq.", 
                "\" The pact envisages US combat troops leaving Iraq by the end of 2011 and departing from all urban areas by June 30 next year.", 
                "But the top US commander in Iraq, General Raymond Odierno, who met with Gates, said that troops will stay in Iraqi cities in a support and training role after June.", 
                "The Shiite radical movement of Moqtada Sadr, which strongly opposed the security deal, said Odierno's remarks showed that Washington had no intention of sticking by the deadlines.", 
                "\"As we predicted, the comments fly in the face of the security agreement,\" the head of the movement's political bureau, Liwaa Sumeissim, told AFP just before Bush's arrival.", 
                "Sadr's movement said it plans a protest on Monday in the holy city of Najaf.", 
                "Obama has said he favours \"a responsible withdrawal from Iraq\" within 16 months of taking office.", 
                "While security in Baghdad and other parts of the country has significantly improved, there are still almost daily bomb attacks.", 
                "Problems also dog the massive economic reconstruction programme undertaken since the invasion.", 
                "The New York Times reported on Sunday that an unpublished US government report concluded that US-led efforts to rebuild Iraq were crippled by bureaucratic turf wars, violence and ignorance of the basic elements of Iraqi society, resulting in a 100-billion-dollar failure.", 
                "By mid-2008, the document said, 117 billion dollars had been spent on the reconstruction of Iraq, including about 50 billion in US taxpayer money, the newspaper reported."

                "President Bush on Sunday made a valedictory visit to Iraq, the country that will largely define his legacy, but the trip will more likely be remembered for the unscripted moment when an Iraqi journalist hurled his shoes at Bush's head and denounced him on live television as a \"dog\" who had delivered death and sorrow here from nearly six years of war.", 
                "The drama unfolded shortly after Bush appeared at a news conference in Baghdad with Prime Minister Nouri Kamal al-Maliki to highlight the newly adopted security agreement between the United States and Iraq.", 
                "That agreement includes a commitment to withdraw all American forces by the end of 2011.", 
                "The Iraqi journalist, Muntader al-Zaidi, 28, a correspondent for Al Baghdadia, an independent Iraqi station, stood up about 12 feet from Bush and shouted in Arabic: \"This is a gift from the Iraqis; this is the farewell kiss, you dog!", 
                "\" He then threw a shoe at Bush, who ducked and narrowly avoided it.", 
                "As stunned security agents and guards, officials and journalists watched, al-Zaidi then threw his other shoe, shouting in Arabic, \"This is from the widows, the orphans and those who were killed in Iraq!", 
                "\" That shoe also narrowly missed Bush as al-Maliki stuck a hand in front of the president's face to help shield him.", 
                "Chaos immediately ensued as a scrum of al-Maliki's security agents jumped on the man, wrestled him to the floor and hustled him out of the ornate room where the news conference was taking place.", 
                "They kicked him and beat him until \"he was crying like a woman,\" said Mohammed Taher, a reporter for Afaq, a station owned by the Dawa Party, which is led by al-Maliki.", 
                "Zaidi was then detained on unspecified charges.", 
                "Other Iraqi journalists in the front row of the news conference publicly apologized to Bush, who was uninjured and tried to brush off the incident by making a joke.", 
                "\"All I can report is it is a size 10,\" he said, continuing to take a few questions and noting the apologies.", 
                "He also called the incident a sign of democracy in the country, saying, \"That's what people do in a free society, draw attention to themselves,\" as the man's screaming could be heard outside.", 
                "But the moment clearly unnerved the aides of al-Maliki and some of the Americans in Bush's entourage, partly because it was televised and may have revealed a security lapse in the so-called Green Zone, the most heavily secured part of Baghdad.", 
                "Dana Perino, the White press secretary, was visibly distraught, and NBC News reported she had been struck in the face by a microphone in the chaos.", 
                "The shoe-throwing incident also punctuated Bush's visit -- his fourth -- in a deeply symbolic way, reflecting the conflicted views in Iraq of a man who had toppled Saddam Hussein, ordered the occupation of the country and brought it the kind of freedoms unthinkable under Saddam's rule but at enormous costs.", 
                "Hitting someone with a shoe is considered the supreme insult in Iraq.", 
                "It means that the target is even lower than the shoe, which is always on the ground and dirty.", 
                "Crowds of people hurled their shoes at the giant statue of Saddam that once stood in Baghad's Firdos Square before helping U.S. Marines to pull it down April 9, 2003, the day the capital fell.", 
                "More recently, a far bigger crowd comprised of Iraqis who had opposed the security agreement did the same with an effigy of Bush in the same square, flinging their shoes at it before burning it.", 
                "Al-Zaidi's motivations in carrying out a potentially career-ending act were unclear, but friends described him as a devoted journalist.", 
                "\"He was committed to his job and after training in Lebanon became chief of correspondents about a month ago,\" said Haider Nassar, who worked with him at Baghdadia.", 
                "\"He had bad feelings about the coalition forces,\" said Nassar, referring to the U.S.-led foreign military forces in Iraq.", 
                "Nassar also said al-Zaidi had asked to cover the news conference, since he was the chief correspondent.", 
                "Another friend said al-Zaidi often ended his reports by saying \"Reporting from occupied Baghdad, this is Muntader al-Zaidi.", 
                "\" Like many Iraqi reporters at the news conference, Nassar said he did not think this was an effective way for al-Zaidi to make his points.", 
                "\"This is so silly; it's just the behavior of an individual.", 
                "He destroyed his future,\" he said.", 
                "The television channel broadcast a request for al-Zaidi's release in the name of democracy and freedom of speech.", 
                "\"Any procedure against Muntader will remind us of the behavior of the dictatorship and their violent actions, random detentions and mass graves,\" the channel said.", 
                "\"Baghdadia TV channel also demands that the international and Iraqi television organizations cooperate in seeking the release of Muntader al-Zaidi.", 
                "\" Shortly before 10 p.m., Bush left the Green Zone by helicopter to Camp Victory, where he was greeted with cheers and whoops from hundreds of troops inside the enormous rotunda of the Al Faw palace.", 
                "Speaking at a lectern beneath an enormous American flag that nearly reached the domed ceiling, he praised this generation of soldiers and reflected on the sacrifice of those who had died.", 
                "He called the increased deployment of U.S. troops in Iraq last year, a strategy known as the surge, which is credited with helping reduce violence here, \"one of the greatest successes in the history of the United States military.", 
                "\" Bush's arrival in Iraq during daylight hours had been one measure of progress; his first visit on Thanksgiving Day 2003 took place entirely at night.", 
                "As with previous visits -- in November 2003, June 2006 and September 2007 -- preparations for the visit were secretive and carried out with ruse.", 
                "The White House schedule for Sunday had Bush attending the \"Christmas in Washington\" performance at the National Building Museum in downtown Washington.", 
                "Instead, he left the White House by car Saturday night, arriving at Andrews Air Force base at 9 p.m. to board Air Force One.", 
                "A dozen journalists accompanying him were only told of the trip Friday and allowed to tell only a superior and a spouse -- and only in person.", 
                "At his news conference with al-Maliki, Bush described the security agreement as a landmark, signaling a new era in the war he began in the spring of 2003.", 
                "\"There is still more work to be done,\" the president said about the war, but with the security agreement and the \"the courage of the Iraqi people, and the Iraqi troops and the American troops and civilian personnel, it is decisively on its way to be won.", 
                "\" Al-Maliki's partnership with Bush and his backing of the security agreement are unlikely to help him much once Bush leaves office.", 
                "Although a majority of the Iraqi parliament approved the agreement, on the street, Iraqis have mixed views.", 
                "Many distrust any agreement made with an occupying power and while Bush is appreciated for having overthrown Saddam, he is widely blamed for the violence that raged in the years after the war, which forced more than a million Iraqis to flee and killed tens of thousands of civilians.", 
                "Still, Bush's stalwart support for al-Maliki -- after an initial period when the national security adviser, Stephen J. Hadley, expressed doubts about him -- has been a bulwark against domestic political forces who sought to topple him.", 
                "With the U.S. president's term ending, Iraqi politicians from parties other than al-Maliki's have been discussing whether to force the prime minister out with a no-confidence vote.", 
                "This is not the first time his ouster has been discussed, but with U.S. power in Iraq on the wane and troops beginning to draw down in earnest, it seems a more serious threat.", 
                "Weighing against it happening, however, is that there is no agreement on al-Maliki's successor or on how to divide Cabinet posts.", 
                "The posts are split among the political blocs that control the parliament, and they would be loath to give up anything they have unless they were assured that they would get another position that was at least as good."

                "Arriving in Baghdad Sunday for a farewell visit, President Bush staunchly defended a war that has taken far more time, money and lives than anticipated, saying the conflict \"has not been easy\" but was necessary for U.S. security, Iraqi stability and \"world peace.", 
                "\" But during a press conference with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, Bush received a taste of the immense resentment many Iraqis feel toward his policies: Just after Bush finished his remarks and said \"Thank you\" in Arabic, an Iraqi journalist took off his shoes and hurled them both at Bush, one after the other.", 
                "The incident lent an air of chaos and farce to a trip intended to highlight improving security conditions in the war-torn country.", 
                "\"This is a farewell kiss!", 
                "\" the man, identified as Muntadar al-Zaidi, a reporter with the Cairo-based network Al Baghdadia Television, yelled as he threw the shoes.", 
                "Bush had to duck out of the way, and narrowly missed being hit, according to on-scene reports.", 
                "Al-Maliki reached out his hand to shield the president.", 
                "Zaidi started to yell \"Dog, dog!", 
                "\" as he was surrounded by security agents, who tackled him to the floor and began to beat him.", 
                "Zaidi was later removed from the ornate room where the press conference was taking place.", 
                "Bush was not injured and joked about the incident.", 
                "\"All I can report is it is a size 10,\" he said.", 
                "Zaidi was seated in the second row of seats, about 12 feet from Bush's lectern.", 
                "Zaidi, colleagues said, was kidnapped by Shiite militiamen last year and was later released.", 
                "Throwing a shoe at someone is considered the worst possible insult in Iraq, and is meant to show extreme disrespect.", 
                "Bush landed in Iraq Sunday under a veil of secrecy for his fourth and presumably final stop as president in a war zone that will be central to defining his turbulent presidency.", 
                "Air Force One landed in Baghdad at around 4 p.m. local time after a 10-1/2 hour overnight flight from Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington.", 
                "Bush was scheduled to meet with U.S. troops and Iraqi leaders about a recently completed security agreement, which calls for the withdrawal of U.S. forces by 2011.", 
                "After meeting with Iraqi President Jalal Talabani at Salam Palace, Bush hailed the security agreement as \"a reminder of our friendship and as a way forward to help the Iraqi people realize the blessings of a free society.", 
                "\" \"The work hasn't been easy, but it has been necessary for American security, Iraqi hope, and world peace,\" Bush said, adding: \"I am just so grateful that I had a chance to come back to Iraq before my presidency ended.", 
                "\" Bush's praise for the security agreement is particularly remarkable given that the U.S. administration spent years dismissing proposals for withdrawal timelines as dangerous admissions of defeat.", 
                "The agreement came after months of hard bargaining by Iraqi leaders, who insisted on a firm date for the removal of U.S. troops.", 
                "Bush and his aides characterize the agreement as a sign of improvement, and Bush said earlier this week that the fight in Iraq was nearing \"a successful end.", 
                "\" His last visit comes against a backdrop of declining violence across Iraq, which the administration attributes to a buildup of thousands of reinforcements last year.", 
                "U.S. commanders have also credited the lower levels of violence to a ceasefire by anti-American Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr and to the Sunni Awakening, in which former insurgents and tribal leaders turned their weapons against Sunni extremists.", 
                "Yet attacks have continued and many areas in Iraq remain unstable, particularly in the north.", 
                "Last week, at least 57 Iraqis were killed in a suicide attack at a popular restaurant outside of the oil-rich city of Kirkuk.", 
                "The improved overall conditions in Iraq have had little discernible impact on the mood of the American public, which has said in polls that the invasion was a mistake.", 
                "Bush offered in a recent interview that faulty intelligence that preceded the war was his \"biggest regret,\" though he declined to say whether he would have changed course if he had known Saddam Hussein had no weapons of mass destruction.", 
                "Bush previously traveled to Iraq in November 2003, June 2006 and September 2007.", 
                "As with those trips, his fourth was surrounded in secrecy.", 
                "Bush's office had distributed a bogus public schedule that said he would attend a \"Christmas in Washington\" event Sunday night at the National Building Museum.", 
                "A group of 13 journalists picked by the White House accompanied Bush and senior aides on the trip.", 
                "They were told about the trip on Friday but were restricted to telling only a spouse and supervisor about the plans.", 
                "Contrary to usual practice, Air Force One was kept in a hangar at Andrews until shortly before takeoff Saturday night.",

                "Iraqi reporter throws shoe at Bush in Baghdad BAGHDAD, Dec. 14 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi reporter threw his shoes at visiting U.S. President George W. Bush and called him a \"dog\" in Arabic during a news conference with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in Baghdad on Sunday.", 
                "Muntadhar al-Zaidi, reporter of Baghdadiya television jumped and threw his two shoes one by one at the president, who ducked and thus narrowly missed being struck, raising chaos in the hall in Baghdad's heavily fortified green Zone.", 
                "\"This is a farewell kiss, dog,\" said Zaidi.", 
                "Several security members wrestled the man to the floor and then dragged him out of the hall as he was screaming.", 
                "However, Bush tried to show himself calm and said \"all I can report is it is a size 10.", 
                "\" \"I didn't feel the least threatened by it,\" Bush also said, adding that \"it doesn't bother me\" before he and Maliki leave the conference room.", 
                "Earlier in the day, Bush arrived Baghdad in an unannounced visit, just 36 days before he leaves office in January."
