                "The neurological and behavioural effects of long-term sleep loss have been well- documented, ranging from lowered concentration and hand-eye coordination to poor mood.", 
                "But the study by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine adds to a growing body of evidence that there is also a physiological price to be paid for insufficient time under the sheets.", 
                "The study found that a sleep deficit built up over just five nights can significantly impair heart function.", 
                "The researchers tested the cardiac function of their 39 volunteers twice -- once at the beginning of the study, after a night of 10 hours' sleep, and again after five nights when they got a mere five hours of shut-eye each night.", 
                "The electrocardiograms revealed that all of the volunteers had a much faster heart beat and significantly less heart rate variability following the nights of sleep deprivation.", 
                "Heart rate variability describes the naturally occurring beat-to-beat changes in heart rate which reflect the body's adjustment to a host of stresses and stimuli.", 
                "Reduced variability can be a marker for cardiac problems and other diseases and has been linked to high blood pressure.", 
                "\"The effect of the sleep deficit was to increase the stress on the hearts of these volunteers,\" said Siobhan Banks, a lead author on the study.", 
                "\"If our finding is sustained by a larger group and further analysis, it may suggest why short sleep duration is associated with a heightened risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality.", 
                "\" The findings are consistent with previous research showing that shift workers are at higher risk for cardiovascular disease due to the fact that they get less sleep because of the disruption in their circadian or sleep-wake rhythms.",

                "Getting a good night's sleep has its rewards, such as reduced fatigue and better concentration.", 
                "For athletes, the benefits may be even bigger -- faster speed and improved performance.", 
                "Those are the findings from a recent, albeit small study in which college basketball players fared better on sprints and free throws after sleeping more than they normally did.", 
                "``Athletes understand how important training is, and nutrition, but there's a third component that makes a big difference in how they perform -- sleep,'' says Cheri Mah, lead author of the study presented last week at the Associated Professional Sleep Societies' meeting in Minneapolis.", 
                "Mah, a researcher at the Stanford Sleep Disorders Clinic and Research Laboratory, says athletes often aren't counseled on the value of adequate sleep, adding that college students are no strangers to sleep deprivation, sometimes maxing out at five or six hours of sleep a night.", 
                "That's far below the 91/2 to 10 hours recommended by sleep experts for adolescents and young adults.", 
                "The study followed six Stanford basketball players, ages 18 to 21, during their 2006 playing season.", 
                "For two weeks they followed normal sleep patterns, then they were told to sleep as much as they could for six weeks, with a goal of 10 hours a night, and to maintain a regular sleeping and waking schedule.", 
                "During both phases, the players were tested several times a week on sprints and free throws after team practice.", 
                "Sprint times improved by a second by the end of the study (16.3 compared with 15.3 on a 282-foot sprint).", 
                "Free throws averaged 7.9 (out of 10) during the regular sleep period, versus 8.8 at the end.", 
                "Three-point shots picked up as well, averaging 9.2 (out of 15) during regular sleep and 11 upon completion.", 
                "Mah says that since the study began in the middle of the season, ``there shouldn't be a learning curve from the baseline'' that would greatly affect the results.", 
                "The athletes were also given standard subjective written tests that measured mood and fatigue; after sleeping more, they reported increased energy and improved mood.", 
                "``I think the sleep debt is the biggest factor that's weighing down these athletes,'' Mah says.", 
                "``When they're in season, they believe they're doing well, but they don't realize how much better they'd be if they reduced their sleep debt.", 
                "A lot of athletes think that fatigue is normal.", 
                "'' A previous study on sleep deprivation published in 1999 in the Lancet found that less sleep resulted in impaired glucose metabolism, which affects how the body stores and processes glucose for energy.", 
                "Even for the weekend basketball player, more sleep could result in better games, says Mah: ``Getting a little extra sleep will give you that little bit more."

                "Cox News Service DAYTON, Ohio -- Is there a correlation between lack of sleep and weight gain?", 
                "Every two years for 16 years, the Nurses Health Study collected data from more than 68,000 women ages 40 to 65, which included information on sleep habits and body weight.", 
                "The study found that participants who slept five hours a night were 32 percent more likely to experience a weight gain of 33 pounds or greater, and 15 percent more likely to become obese, compared with participants who slept seven hours a night.", 
                "The group who slept for six hours were 12 percent more likely to experience major weight gain and 6 percent more likely to become obese when compared with those who slept seven hours a night.", 
                "One possible explanation for these differences is that lack of sleep causes the body to burn calories less efficiently.", 
                "Variations in eating habits and exercise among the groups also explained some of the weight gain, although no single factor can be pinpointed.", 
                "The amount and quality of sleep affects hormones that regulate appetite and metabolism.", 
                "A study at the University of Chicago found that participants who slept only four hours a night for two nights had an 18 percent decrease in leptin and a 28 percent increase in ghrelin.", 
                "Leptin is a hormone that suppresses appetite by affecting how full and satisfied we feel after eating.", 
                "Ghrelin is a hormone that stimulates appetite.", 
                "With sleep deprivation, levels of leptin fall, while ghrelin levels increase.", 
                "Participants in the study, all healthy young men, showed a 24 percent increase in appetite along with elevated cravings for sweets, salty foods, and starchy foods like bread and pasta.", 
                "Leptin is only one of a large number of genes that can influence body weight, while environment and lifestyle behaviors remain the primary causes of weight gain.", 
                "When a person is fatigued from too little sleep, they are also less likely to exercise, making it easier to put on extra pounds.", 
                "Lack of sleep affects other hormones such as cortisol, insulin and growth hormone, potentially causing a desire for high-calorie foods.", 
                "It is believed that decreased amounts of REM sleep can lead to increased food intake.", 
                "REM stands for \"Rapid Eye Movement\" and is the \"dream\" phase of the sleep cycle.", 
                "During REM sleep brain activity increases with less muscle activity.", 
                "Aside from the potential increase in body weight, sleep deprivation can have serious effects on physical and mental health.", 
                "When the brain has to work harder in an effort to counteract sleep deficit, its ability to function deteriorates quickly.", 
                "Memory, concentration and problem solving capabilities decrease.", 
                "The ability to handle everyday stress, maintain a healthy immune system and control emotions is also compromised.", 
                "It is recommended that children ages 3 to 5 years get 11-13 hours of sleep per night; ages 5-12, 9 to 11 hours; and adolescents, 8 1/2 to 9 1/2 hours.", 
                "Although most experts recommend seven to nine hours of sleep a night for adults, the exact amount needed to function at our best varies from person to person.", 
                "A study at NASA on sleep-deprived military pilots and astronauts showed that taking a 40-minute nap improved performance by 34 percent and alertness 100 percent.", 
                "Naps that are too long or taken too late in the day, however, affect the quality of nighttime sleep, so proper planning is important.", 
                "Generally, a 20- to 30-minute nap is enough time to reap the benefits of increased alertness and performance and improved mood.",

                "A new study by British researchers reveals that women's health is much more at risk from sleep deprivation than men's.",

                "The researchers looked at men and women sleeping less than or equal to 5 hours a night to see if their risk of developing hypertension was any higher than men and women getting the recommended 7 hours or more of sleep a night.", 
                "The researchers found that those women in the study group who slept less than or equal to 5 hours a night were twice as likely to suffer from hypertension than women who slept for the recommended seven hours or more a night.", 
                "The researchers found no difference between men sleeping less than 5 hours and those sleeping 7 hours or more.", 
                "The researchers defined hypertension as blood pressure equal to or higher than 140/90 mm Hg or if the subject made regular use of antihypertensive medications.", 
                "Among other problems, increased hypertension increases the risk of cardiovascular problems, according to the researchers.", 
                "Sustained sleep curtailment, ensuing excessive daytime sleepiness, and the higher cardiovascular risk are causes for concern with emerging evidence suggesting a potential role for sleep deprivation as a predictor or risk factor for conditions such as obesity and diabetes, according to Professor Francesco Cappuccio, who led the research."
