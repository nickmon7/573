                "The family of former Liberian president Charles Taylor, facing charges of war crimes, said Friday that his lawyers have threatened to withdraw from the case, claiming a lack of time and resources.", 
                "\"The lawyers argued that the time and resources available to them were so inadequate that it places them in a position of conflict with their professional obligation and renders the possibility of fair trial impossible\", the family said in a statement sent to AFP.", 
                "\"The lawyers threaten to withdraw their services if the situation does not change\", the statement said.", 
                "Taylor's family also accused the Special War Crimes Court in The Hague, where the ex-leader is imprisoned, of violating Taylor's right to privacy and right to legal professional privilege by installing a video surveillance camera to record conferences with his attorneys.", 
                "\"That has compromised Mr. Taylor's ability to give instructions and freely discuss with his defence counsels and other individuals,\" the statement said.", 
                "His family complained that the prosecution currently has five senior counsels in its team while the defence has two lawyers with no proper offices both in The Hague and in Monrovia.", 
                "At the same time, Taylor was said to be in good health in his cell at The Hague where he mostly reads the Bible.", 
                "The trial of the ex-warlord, the biggest case before the UN-backed court due to start in April, was moved out of Freetown and to the premises of the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague to avoid stirring unrest in strife-prone west Africa.", 
                "Taylor is seen as the single most powerful figure behind a series of civil wars in Liberia and neighbouring Sierra Leone between 1989 and 2003 which left some 400,000 people dead.", 
                "He faces a total of 11 charges of crimes against humanity, war crimes and violations of international human rights and is specifically accused of aiding rebel groups which murdered, enslaved and mutilated civilians."

                "Former Liberian President Charles Taylor will not be ready for the start of his trial in June on charges of overseeing a campaign of terror, murder, mutilation, rape and enslavement in West Africa, his lawyer told a judge Friday.", 
                "Judge Teresa Doherty made it clear, however, the trial's June 4 start date would not change.", 
                "The trial was expected to take up to a year.", 
                "Taylor has pleaded innocent to 11 charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity linked to the killing and mistreatment of thousands of people during Sierra Leone's bloody 10-year civil war.", 
                "He faces a life sentence if convicted by the Special Court for Sierra Leone.", 
                "Taylor's lawyer, Karim Khan, said during Friday's 80-minute hearing that he would work toward the start date, but said, \"we will not be ready\" given the huge amount of prosecution evidence he has to study.", 
                "Taylor did not to appear in the courtroom in The Hague provided by the International Criminal Court.", 
                "His attendance is not required at such preliminary hearings.", 
                "Khan also protested that prosecutors were not allowing him to distribute electronic copies of evidence to his client or other defense lawyers in Africa and requested that they release details of expert witnesses they plan to call in the case.", 
                "Prosecutor Stephen Rapp said prosecutors fear that giving electronic versions of their evidence could allow confidential details to leak into the public.", 
                "Doherty ordered prosecutors to disclose details of their expert witnesses \"as early as possible\" but did not order any change in the way they shared information.", 
                "She also ordered prosecutors to provide a document outlining their case by April 4.", 
                "Prosecutors expect to call more than 100 witnesses, Rapp said.", 
                "Taylor was flown to the Netherlands in June last year amid fears that staging his trial in Sierra Leone, where the Special Court usually sits, could trigger fresh unrest in the war-scarred African nation.", 
                "Taylor's defense team had asked for the trial to start in September, saying it was unlikely to be ready before then because of the case's complexity, the amount of evidence turned over by prosecutors and lack of facilities for defense attorneys in The Hague.", 
                "The charges against Taylor stem from his alleged backing of Sierra Leonean rebels, who mutilated, raped and enslaved their victims.", 
                "The rebels also looted and torched homes, according to Taylor's indictment, which covers crimes allegedly committed between November, 1996 and January, 2002.", 
                "\"The primary objective of the attacks was to terrorize the civilian population of Sierra Leone,\" prosecutors say in a summary of the allegations.", 
                "\"Many civilians saw these crimes committed; others returned to their homes or places of refuge to find the results of these crimes -- dead bodies, savaged or mutilated victims and looted and burned property.", 
                "\" Taylor also launched a Liberian insurgency in 1989 and won elections that handed him the presidency in 1997.", 
                "Rebels took up arms against him three years later, and he fled to Nigeria in 2003 at the end of Liberia's 14-year civil war.", 
                "In March last year, he was captured as he attempted to slip out of Nigeria after the country agreed to hand him over to authorities seeking his prosecution."

                "Potential defense witnesses for Charles Taylor are refusing to testify at the former Liberian president's war crimes trial for fear of being slapped with U.N. travel bans, Taylor's lawyer told a court Monday.", 
                "Taylor, 59, is to go on trial June 4 on 11 charges, including terrorism, murder, rape, sexual slavery, mutilation and recruiting child soldiers linked to his alleged support for rebels in Sierra Leone's brutal civil war.", 
                "He has pleaded innocent and faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment if convicted by the Special Court for Sierra Leone.", 
                "At a pretrial hearing in The Hague, Taylor's lawyer Karim Khan said his efforts to build a defense were being hampered by the perceived threat of U.N. sanctions.", 
                "\"Numerous individuals ... are unwilling to speak to the defense (because) they are petrified of having travel bans imposed upon them and having their assets frozen by the Security Council because they are associated to the defense of Mr. Charles Taylor,\" Khan said.", 
                "Khan said he would file a motion asking judges at the court to grant witnesses protection from sanctions.", 
                "He said that the possibility of sanctions, \"would amount to witness intimidation, whether it comes from a group or a party or even as august a body ... as the Security Council of the United Nations.", 
                "The Sierra Leone court usually sits in the capital, Freetown, but Taylor's trial is to be held in a courtroom rented from the International Criminal Court in The Hague because of fears the case could trigger new violence.", 
                "Taylor sat in court listening to proceedings wearing a dark suit and brown tie.", 
                "Judges also allowed him to wear sunglasses in the windowless courtroom because of an eye infection.", 
                "At Monday's hearing, slated to be the last before the trial starts next month, Khan also complained that the court was not funding an adequate defense team for Taylor.", 
                "Taylor has two attorneys and three legal assistants, while prosecutors have a trial team of some 10 attorneys and lawyers.", 
                "Khan said that former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic had a much larger defense team when he went on trial for genocide at the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal.", 
                "\"The concern of my client is that he is being shortchanged,\" Khan said.", 
                "Taylor's lawyers are seeking to appeal the decision setting the start date for the trial, arguing that they have not had enough time to prepare.", 
                "Prosecutors say that in exchange for diamonds smuggled out of Sierra Leone, Taylor provided rebels with arms, ammunition, communication equipment, as well as alcohol, drugs and cigarettes."
