                "The breast cancer study, published online in the current issue of the Journal of Steroid Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, found that individuals with the highest blood levels of 25- hydroxyvitamin D, or 25(OH)D, had the lowest risk of breast cancer.", 
                "The researchers divided the 1,760 records of individuals into five equal groups, from the lowest blood levels of 25(OH)D (less than 13 nanograms per milliliter, or 13 ng/ml) to the highest ( approximately 52 ng/ml).", 
                "The data also included whether or not the individual had developed cancer.", 
                "\"The data were very clear, showing that individuals in the group with the lowest blood levels had the highest rates of breast cancer, and the breast cancer rates dropped as the blood levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D increased,\" said study co- author Cedric Garland, Dr.P.H.", 
                "\"The serum level associated with a 50 percent reduction in risk could be maintained by taking 2,000 international units of vitamin D3 daily plus, when the weather permits, spending 10 to 15 minutes a day in the sun.", 
                "\" The colorectal cancer study, published online February 6 in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, is a meta-analysis of five studies that explored the association of blood levels of 25( OH)D with risk of colon cancer.", 
                "All of the studies involved blood collected and tested for 25 (OH)D levels from healthy volunteer donors who were then followed for up to 25 years for development of colorectal cancer.", 
                "As with the breast cancer study, the dose-response data on a total of 1,448 individuals were put into order by serum 25(OH)D level and then divided into five equal groups, from the lowest blood levels to the highest.", 
                "\"Through this meta-analysis we found that raising the serum level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 34 ng/ml would reduce the incidence rates of colorectal cancer by half,\" said co-author Edward D. Gorham, Ph.D. \"We project a two-thirds reduction in incidence with serum levels of 46ng/ml, which corresponds to a daily intake of 2,000 IU of vitamin D3.", 
                "This would be best achieved with a combination of diet, supplements and 10 to 15 minutes per day in the sun,\" he added.", 
                "Vitamin D3 is available through diet, supplements and exposure of the skin to sunlight, or ultraviolet B (UVB).", 
                "In the paper, the researchers also underscored the importance of limiting sun exposure such that the skin does not change color (tan) or burn."

                "Vitamin D is a fat soluble vitamin that is found in food and is made in the body because sunlight's UV rays trigger vitamin D synthesis in the skin.", 
                "US health authorities have not established a recommended daily allowance for the vitamin due to insufficient scientific evidence.", 
                "For the breast cancer study, published online in the Journal of Steroid Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, researchers analyzed data from two earlier studies on the response to vitamin D doses among 1,760 people.", 
                "\"The data were very clear, showing that individuals in the group with the lowest blood levels had the highest rates of breast cancer, and the breast cancer rates dropped as the blood levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D increased,\" said study co- author Cedric Garland.", 
                "\"The serum level associated with a 50 percent reduction in risk could be maintained by taking 2,000 international units of vitamin D3 daily plus, when the weather permits, spending 10 to 15 minutes a day in the sun,\" he said.", 
                "The colorectal cancer research, published online in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, analyzed five studies on 1,448 individuals that explored the association of blood levels of vitamin D with colon cancer risk.", 
                "The incidence rate of colorectal cancer could be reduced by half with a serum level 34 nanograms per milliliter (ng/ml), the study found.", 
                "\"We project a two-thirds reduction in incidence with serum levels of 46ng/ml, which corresponds to a daily intake of 2,000 IU of vitamin D3.", 
                "This would be best achieved with a combination of diet, supplements and 10 to 15 minutes per day in the sun,\" said study co-author Edward Gorham.", 
                "The researchers highlighted the importance of limiting sun exposure to avoid skin cancer risks.", 
                "They said a fair-skinned white person could get an adequate dose of vitamin D by spending 10 to 15 minutes in the noontime sun on a clear day with 50 percent of skin area exposed to the sun, while darker skinned people may need to stay as long as 25 minutes under the sun to achieve a similiar benefit.", 
                "The two studies were conducted by a core team of cancer prevention specialists at the Moores Cancer Center at University of California, San Diego (UCSD), and other colleagues."

                "\"It is one of those vitamins that they're taking a closer look at to see if we really need to increase how many units we should take,\" she says.",

                "\"I'm thinking if that's me, because I don't have a horrible diet, I can't imagine what the general population's is,\" Carr says.",

                "Now, when she does nutritional consultations with patients who are complaining of joint pain or muscle weakness, she asks if their doctor has checked their vitamin D levels.", 
                "Scientists are also assessing the vitamin's role in boosting the immune system and protecting against some cancers.", 
                "Typically, dietitians say the best source of vitamins is through the foods we eat, rather than supplements.", 
                "But Carr says the best food sources of vitamin D aren't necessarily the foods we love.", 
                "A tablespoon of cod-liver oil contains more than 1,300 IUs.", 
                "Salmon (360 IUs for 3.5 ounces), sardines (250 IUs for 13/4 ounces) and fortified milk (about 100 IUs per serving) are also good sources.", 
                "In the summer, go without sunscreen for no more than 15 minutes a few times a week, and your body can make sufficient amounts of vitamin D without putting you at greater risk for skin cancer, Busch says.",

                "Might higher levels of vitamin D in the blood lower the likelihood of developing this cancer?", 
                "THIS STUDY combined and analyzed data from five studies, involving 1,448 healthy people whose blood was tested for the presence of the 25-hydroxy-vitamin D, the main form of vitamin D in the circulatory system.", 
                "The participants' health was monitored for up to 25 years.", 
                "During that time, those whose blood registered the highest levels of vitamin D were the least likely to develop colorectal cancer.", 
                "For example, people with a 25(OH)D blood level of 33 nanograms per milliliter or higher were 50 percent less likely to have developed colorectal cancer than were those with a level of 12 ng/ml or lower.", 
                "The study estimated that taking 1,000 to 2,000 international units of vitamin D supplements daily would create a blood level of at least 33 ng/ml.", 
                "WHO MAY BE AFFECTED BY THESE FINDINGS?", 
                "Anyone concerned about colorectal cancer.", 
                "More than 90 percent of diagnoses occur after age 50.", 
                "Cause of the disease is unknown, but contributing factors appear to include family history, smoking and diet.", 
                "CAVEATS All participants in the studies were white; whether the findings apply to others is unclear.", 
                "The study reported a possible association between the vitamin and cancer, not a cause-and-effect relationship.", 
                "FIND THIS STUDY March issue of the American Journal of Preventive Medicine; abstract available at www.ajpm-online.net.", 
                "LEARN MORE ABOUT colorectal cancer at www.cdc.gov/cancer and www.cancer.org.", 
                "The research described in Quick Study comes from credible, peer-reviewed journals.", 
                "Nonetheless, conclusive evidence about a treatment's effectiveness is rarely found in a single study.", 
                "Anyone considering changing or beginning treatment of any kind should consult with a physician."

                "Experts remain split, though, on how much to take.", 
                "\"The findings ... are a breakthrough of great medical and public health importance,\" declared Cedric Garland, a prominent vitamin D researcher at the University of California-San Diego.", 
                "\"No other method to prevent cancer has been identified that has such a powerful impact.", 
                "\" While the most reliable yet, the study does have drawbacks.", 
                "It was designed mainly to monitor how calcium and vitamin D improve bone health, and the number of cancer cases overall was small, showing up in just 50 patients.", 
                "\"It's a very small study,\" said Dr. Edward Giovannucci, who researches nutrition and cancer at the Harvard School of Public Health.", 
                "\"I don't think it's the last word.", 
                "\" In either case, the study takes an important step in extending several decades of research that began with observations that cancer rates among similar groups of people were lower in southern latitudes than in northern ones.", 
                "Scientists reasoned that had to do with more direct sunlight in southern regions.", 
                "The skin makes vitamin D when exposed to sunlight's ultraviolet rays.", 
                "This study used that same form of the vitamin, known as D3 or cholecalciferol.", 
                "Multivitamins usually carry a much weaker variant known as D2, but D3 is available in stand-alone dietary supplements.", 
                "Earlier research has shown that vitamin D helps regulate cell growth, a fundamental biological process that goes haywire in cancer.", 
                "Most other supplements have tended to target specific types of disease in early testing, like selenium or vitamin E for prostate cancer.", 
                "This study, published Friday in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, is the first time that researchers significantly boosted -- and measured -- blood levels of vitamin D and then followed identical groups of patients from start to finish.", 
                "That is why, despite its modest size, the research was generating excitement.", 
                "Nearly all other work has compared disparate groups of patients.", 
                "The researchers at Creighton University in Omaha focused on 1,179 seemingly healthy women with an average age of 67.", 
                "The women were divided into three groups: 446 got calcium and vitamin D3 supplements, a similar number got calcium alone, and 288 took dummy pills.", 
                "The research team gave 1,000 daily international units of vitamin D, more than current guidelines calling for 200 to 600 units depending on a person's age.", 
                "The researchers intended to check mainly for the effects of calcium on bone health.", 
                "Their interest in cancer risk was secondary.", 
                "But the lower cancer risk stood out.", 
                "Only 13 women, or 3 percent, developed cancer over four years of calcium and vitamin D supplements.", 
                "With calcium alone, 17 women, or 4 percent, got cancer.", 
                "With dummy pills, cancer appeared in 20 women, or 7 percent.", 
                "That shows a 60 percent lower cancer risk over four years in the group taking both supplements, compared to patients taking placebos.", 
                "And when the first-year cancers were excluded -- the ones mostly likely present before the study began -- the findings were stronger still: a 77 percent lower risk for the combo group.", 
                "While the calcium-only group lowered its four-year cancer risk by 47 percent compared to the untreated group, it did no better when early cancers were excluded.", 
                "That suggests calcium alone may have done little in this experiment, the researchers said.", 
                "Experts reviewing the study focused on vitamin D as the powerful agent in the combo group, but it can't be ruled out that calcium might somehow amplify the effect of vitamin D. While numbers were limited, these women developed a broad range of cancers, including disease of the breast, colon, lungs and blood.", 
                "Dr. Michael Holick, of Boston University Medical Center, who sat on the professional panel that issued the 1997 guidelines for vitamin D, said this study shows that enough vitamin D \"markedly reduces the risk of developing the most serious deadly cancers.", 
                "\" He supports raising the recommended amount of the vitamin and said 1,000 daily units of vitamin D3 would now be reasonable for most people.", 
                "On the other hand, Dr. Michael Thun of the American Cancer Society favors keeping the current recommendation of 200 to 600 IUs for now.", 
                "And he cautioned that more than 2,000 units is viewed in the guidelines as potentially dangerous.", 
                "Joan Lappe, the study's lead researcher, said it \"just adds to the great bunch of evidence that we need to have better vitamin D nutrition.", 
                "\" Some foods carry the vitamin, like salmon, tuna and fortified milk, but diet accounts for little of the vitamin circulating in the body.", 
                "Overexposure to the sun can cause skin cancer.", 
                "Still, people should consult their doctors before boosting their vitamin dosage, several experts also warned.",

                "The authors were intrigued by the observation that death from many diseases, including cancer, heart disease and diabetes, appears to increase with increasing latitude.",

                "The farther from the equator, the less we are exposed to ultraviolet light.", 
                "Light from the sun converts a chemical in our skin into vitamin D, and further conversions in the liver and kidney make the most active form of the vitamin: vitamin D3.", 
                "The role of vitamin D in chronic disease is unclear, but the vitamin is needed for strong bones and to regulate cell growth.", 
                "A lack of the vitamin might affect the growth of cancer cells and the growth of artery-clogging plaque that leads to heart attack and stroke.", 
                "It has long been known that blood levels of vitamin D decrease as we age (by age 70, we make about half of what we did at age 20).", 
                "Adults should get a blood test to make sure they are getting enough vitamin D. If we make less as we age and if slathering on sunblock reduces our ability to make the vitamin, where can we get it?", 
                "Very few foods naturally contain vitamin D. It is a fat-soluble vitamin found in fatty fish, like salmon, as well as liver and eggs.", 
                "Milk is not a natural source of the vitamin, but most dairies fortify milk with it.", 
                "Even breast milk is vitamin-D deficient, so breast-fed infants need vitamin D supplements.", 
                "One cup of most commercially available milk contains 100 International Units of vitamin D or about 25 percent of daily needs for young adults.", 
                "You might be surprised that another popular dairy food, yogurt, may not contain any vitamin D. For example, Yoplait yogurt has 80 IU of vitamin D in a 6-ounce container, but Dannon fruit-on-the-bottom yogurt has none.", 
                "Vitamin D content does not always show up on the nutrition facts panel, so be a label reader to find out if your favorite food contains this important vitamin.", 
                "Calcium-fortified orange juice often contains vitamin D (Tropicana with calcium and vitamin D provides as much calcium and vitamin D in 8 ounces as in one glass of milk), but Tropicana regular orange juice doesn't contain the vitamin.", 
                "Most multivitamin supplements contain 400 IU of vitamin D. So if you don't drink milk or get enough from your favorite foods, consider taking a daily multivitamin.",

                "A U.S. research team has found that increased exposure to sunlight -- which increases levels of vitamin D in the body -- may decrease the risk of advanced breast cancer, according to a study reported Friday in the latest issue of American Journal of Epidemiology.", 
                "The researchers from the Northern California Cancer Center, the University of Southern California, and Wake Forest University found that women with high sun exposure had half the risk of developing advanced breast cancer, which is cancer that has spread beyond the breast, compared to women with low sun exposure.", 
                "These findings were observed only for women with naturally light skin color.", 
                "The fact that this difference occurred only in light skin color group suggests that the effect was due to differences in vitamin D production, said the researchers.", 
                "And the difference was seen only in women with advanced disease, suggesting that vitamin D may be important in slowing the growth of breast cancer cells.", 
                "\"We believe that sunlight helps to reduce women's risk of breast cancer because the body manufactures the active form of vitamin D from exposure to sunlight,\" said Esther John, lead researcher on the study from the Northern California Cancer Center.", 
                "\"It is possible that these effects were observed only among light- skinned women because sun exposure produces less vitamin D among women with naturally darker pigmentation.", 
                "\" Skin color is an important factor that determines how much vitamin D is produced in the body after sun exposure.", 
                "Dark-skinned individuals produce up to 10 times less vitamin D than light- skinned individuals for the same amount of time spent in the sun.", 
                "These new findings are consistent with previous research by John and colleagues that had shown that women who reported frequent sun exposure had a lower risk of developing breast cancer than women with infrequent sun exposure.", 
                "The researchers stressed that sunlight is not the only source of vitamin D, which can be obtained from multivitamins, fatty fish and fortified foods such as milk, certain cereals and fruit juices.", 
                "Women should not try to reduce their risk of breast cancer by sunbathing because of the risks of sun-induced skin cancer, they said.", 
                "\"If future studies continue to show reductions in breast cancer risk associated with sun exposure, increasing vitamin D intake from diet and supplements may be the safest solution to achieve adequate levels of vitamin D,\" said Gary Schwartz, a co-researcher from Wake Forest University."
