                "Pink coral, cedar trees, types of fish eaten in Europe and a cuddly, wide-eyed mammal that is prized in Asian medicine are among the animal and plant species that could gain greater protection this year, a UN agency said Wednesday.", 
                "The United Nations agency regulating the trade in endangered species, CITES, unveiled some 40 new government proposals for changes to wildlife trade rules which will be considered at the organisation's conference in June.", 
                "The agency said many of the proposals reflected growing international concern about the accelerating destruction of the world's marine and forest resources through overfishing and excessive logging.", 
                "\"Biological diversity faces many threats, ranging from habitat destruction to climate change to unrestrained commercial harvesting for trade,\" said Achim Steiner, executive director of the UN Environment Programme, which administers CITES.", 
                "Potentially the most endearing candidate for a complete ban trade is the Slow Loris, a small furry nocturnal primate from south and southeast Asia.", 
                "Cambodia, which is sponsoring full protection under CITES Appendix I, says the Loris is threatened by a combination of the destruction of its forest habitat and growing demand for traditional medicine and as a pet.", 
                "The requests also include an attempt by the United States to control the trade in pink coral for the first time, because of the overexploitation of tropical coral reefs which have been rendered fragile and bleached by climate change.", 
                "The pink variety of the polyp has been prized in jewellery and for decoration for 5,000 years.", 
                "\"Extensive deforestation\" of the cedar tree in South and central America, is prompting the European Union to seek trade restrictions under Appendix II for the species, which is valued for its insect and rot resistant wood.", 
                "The EU also wants the trade in the European eels, a popular food in coastal areas of northern Europe, and the spiny dogfish, a type of shark prized in fish and chip shops, to be subject to a permit system and fisheries management, CITES said.", 
                "Germany, which currently holds the European Union presidency, said the spiny dogfish was vulnerable because of its tendency to travel in large schools that are easily trawled by fishing boats and its slow reproductive rate.", 
                "Meanwhile European eel stocks have declined \"dramatically\" due to overfishing according to CITES.", 
                "Other fish species up for protection due to overexploitation include Brazilian lobsters, while several countries want complete halt in trade in the sawfish, a favourite for traditional medicine.", 
                "A popular item in home aquariums, the striking tropical Bangai cardinal fish, is also a candidate for listing, because about 700,000 to 900,000 of them are collected every year."

                "Nedimyer had led them to a nursery, one of a number he has established since 2000, when chance, coincidence, a government program and a lifelong passion for tropical fish set him on an adventure: a quest to nourish and restore the tattered remains of the Keys' once glorious reefs.", 
                "He is working with assistance from the conservancy, which in turn cooperates with the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary and the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, which has its own coral efforts in places like Puerto Rico.",

                "First, as oceans absorb more carbon dioxide, the chief greenhouse gas, they become more acidic.", 
                "The acidity makes it more difficult for corals to grow and may even cause them to start to dissolve.", 
                "And as oceans warm, algae that live in corals, and on which they depend, may be killed.", 
                ") David Lackland, a biologist at Mote, tells children who visit that corals live with algae as people might live if they liked asparagus, say, but instead of raising it in gardens they grew it inside their bodies, absorbing it directly as energy and fertilizing it with their waste in a symbiotic relationship.", 
                "Different kinds of corals have different kinds of algae symbionts, but if the algae are threatened, corals are threatened, too.", 
                "Another serious disruption is overfishing.",

                "The disease, which struck the Caribbean in the mid-1990s, kills healthy tissue, leaving only white skeletons.", 
                "It usually progresses quickly, and while it almost never wipes out complete colonies, colonies can be reinfected.", 
                "Scientists do not know for sure what causes the condition, and their suspects -- bacteria, fungi and other microbes -- are present at healthy corals as well as sickly formations, adding to the mystery.",

                "He feeds his coral oyster larvae and other plankton, which he buys from an aquarium supplier, and he has devised formulas to maintain the proper mineral balance in the water.",

                "The global wildlife trade watchdog agreed Wednesday to regulate sales of red coral, which conservationists say is under threat from overfishing for the jewelry industry.", 
                "\"This is the best possible decision to start getting the trade in these corals under some form of international control,\" said Ernie Cooper, a coral trade expert from wildlife monitoring network TRAFFIC.", 
                "Delegates at the triennial meeting of the 171-nation Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species put the coral on a list of protected wildlife, meaning exporters will now have to prove that the coral was harvested without threatening the species' survival before they can sell it.", 
                "Red coral, also known by its Latin name corallium, is a slow-growing deep-sea coral that grows all over the world but is harvested mainly in the Mediterranean and parts of the Pacific.", 
                "In the Mediterranean, it is gathered by scuba divers but in some other parts of the world fishermen still use trawl nets dragged along the seabed -- a practice that devastates the coral.", 
                "Andy Bruckner of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, who drafted the U.S. proposal adopted at the conference, welcomed its acceptance.", 
                "\"Red coral is the most valuable and widely traded out of all the coral species, and CITES protection will help ensure the future of the species and the red coral industry,\" he said.", 
                "\"We are pleased that the international community has recognized the threats corallium face, and is taking the necessary steps to safeguard these species.", 
                "\" The United States, the world's biggest market for corallium products, imported more than 26 million pieces from 2001-2006, says the environmental group SeaWeb, which lobbied for the CITES protection.", 
                "Raw coral can sell for US$900 (euro670) per kilogram (2.2 pounds) at auction and finished works of art or pieces of jewelry can cost anywhere from US$20 (euro15) to US$20,000 (euro15,000) depending on their size and quality.", 
                "Part of the reason the coral is so vulnerable is that it grows so slowly -- in some cases just 1.5 millimeters (0.06 inches) or less per year -- takes up to seven years to reach maturity and has low reproduction rates.", 
                "Italian craftsmen from the town of Torre Del Greco near Naples had lobbied against CITES regulating the trade, saying that they had been harvesting it in a sustainable way for 800 years and would continue to do so to preserve their livelihoods.", 
                "\"We are not an industry; this is our tradition, our culture.", 
                "Coral is our life,\" Ciro Condito of Assocoral, a lobby group representing the craftsmen, said before Wednesday's decision."

                "Green sea turtles, cascades of glittering reef fish, blooming coral pillars -- countless travelers have come nose to nose with a thriving undersea universe while on vacation.", 
                "But increasingly, divers and snorkelers are swimming over bleached hunks of coral devastated by shore runoff or overfishing.From the South Pacific to the Caribbean, coral reefs -- which are among the most delicate of marine ecosystems -- are bearing the brunt of climate change and other human-driven activities -- including coastal development, deforestation, and unrestricted tourism.", 
                "Now, many in the tourist industry are trying to halt the damage.", 
                "And it is no wonder.", 
                "The dollars involved in reef-based tourism are significant: Australia's Great Barrier Reef alone draws about 1.9 million visitors a year, supporting a $4.2 billion industry.", 
                "According to the Nature Conservancy, the annual economic value of coral reefs to world tourism is $9.6 billion.", 
                "Growing awareness of environmental issues means that the tourism industry has lately been a partner to conservation efforts in major reef areas.", 
                "Though the Great Barrier is the most famous reef, it is not the most threatened; its extensive marine management program is widely regarded as a model for conservation.", 
                "It includes eco-certification programs for tourism operators within the boundaries of the marine park, environmental tourist fees, large no-take zones, species monitoring, and tourism industry contributions to the Great Barrier Reef's main research center.", 
                "But the world's second-largest barrier reef, the Mesoamerican Reef in the Caribbean, is seriously endangered by coastal development, runoff, and pollution.", 
                "The reef system stretches nearly 700 miles from the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico to the Bay Islands of Honduras.", 
                "And reefs in the Coral Triangle in Southeast Asia -- which reaches from Malaysia to the Philippines, Indonesia, and the Solomon Islands, encompassing some of the planet's most diverse marine habitats -- have been severely damaged by overfishing and destructive practices, including the use of cyanide and dynamite to capture fish.", 
                "In 2004, the nonprofit group Conservation International began a program called the Mesoamerican Reef Tourism Initiative, which aims to address the threat that mass tourism poses to the Mesoamerican Reef by engaging hoteliers, developers, cruise lines, and local governments in Mexico, Belize, and Honduras.", 
                "There is special emphasis on the Riviera Maya of Mexico, where, less than nine miles offshore, the island of Cozumel is the world's second most-visited cruise destination after Miami, according to the International Council of Cruise Lines.", 
                "Last year, as part of the Mesoamerican Reef initiative's efforts, the cruise line council began an effort to avoid wastewater discharge by cruise ships in environmentally sensitive areas.", 
                "\"This program will ensure that cruise line wastewater is discharged at least four miles from any of the sensitive marine ecosystems within the Mesoamerican Reef system, thereby minimizing the chance such discharges will have negative impact on the long-term health of the reef,\" said Jamie Sweeting, who oversees Conservation International's work with the travel industry.", 
                "The cruise industry is a particular area of concern, since ships regularly disgorge crowds of passengers into fragile coastal areas that strain to absorb the impact.", 
                "Conservation International estimates that cruise passengers typically make about 2,000 scuba dives in and around Cozumel's surrounding reefs in a single day.", 
                "\"We're working with the municipal government, the local dive and water sports association, and the cruise lines themselves, because they all have a vested interest to look after this coral reef,\" Sweeting said.", 
                "Areas being addressed include the creation of a dedicated snorkeling zone in Cozumel to limit visitor impact to one section of the reef, and ensuring that park management fees are collected and put toward protection and management of marine areas.", 
                "The Mesoamerican Reef Tourism Initiative has also begun a program to evaluate and implement good business practices for conserving water and energy, reducing solid waste, and managing chemicals at coastal hotels along the Riviera Maya and in southern Belize.", 
                "Crucial partnerships between conservation groups and the tourism industry have also taken root in the Coral Triangle.", 
                "In developing nations like Indonesia, where human and financial resources are slim, the cooperation of private tourism businesses has been instrumental in accomplishing reef conservation goals.", 
                "For example, Bunaken National Park, in north Sulawesi, is today managed in large part by a local association of dive operators who saw the declining quality of coral (and their livelihood) in the mid-1990s.", 
                "The Nature Conservancy's Coral Triangle Center works at several sites in Indonesia, including the Raja Ampat Islands in Papua and Komodo National Park, a major protected marine area in the Lesser Sunda Islands.", 
                "Komodo is now run by a nonprofit joint venture between the Nature Conservancy and a local tourism company.", 
                "The joint venture, PT Putri Naga Komodo, was established in 2005.", 
                "Founded in 1980, the park is a World Heritage Site and protects the habitat of the Komodo dragon, as well as important whale migration routes between the Indian and Pacific Oceans.", 
                "The reefs are rich in coral species and home to up to 1,000 species of fish.", 
                "\"After a decade supporting conservation in Komodo National Park, the Nature Conservancy recognized the need for self-sufficiency,\" said Marcus Matthews-Sawyer, director of tourism communications for the joint venture.", 
                "Tourism has helped raise awareness of the destination and of the reefs' biological importance.", 
                "Blast fishing -- using explosives to stun or kill fish -- is now prohibited within the park.", 
                "The ban is credited with a 60 percent increase in hard coral coverage between 1996 and 2002, according to the Coral Triangle Center.", 
                "The collection of conservation fees from tourists, about $15 a stay, is vital to sustaining park management.", 
                "The partnership plans to have Komodo self-financed by park fees by 2012.", 
                "Though Komodo is one of Indonesia's greatest tourism assets -- it is one of the most frequently visited nature reserves in the country -- conservation work there is also necessary to protect young fish that are a source for surrounding fishing grounds.", 
                "Enforcement of the park zoning system, which restricts access to certain parts of the reefs, continues to be a challenge because of limited resources.", 
                "But a major goal of the tourism partnership is supporting sustainable community use of the reef area, which includes providing alternative livelihoods to destructive fishing.", 
                "All three reef systems -- the Great Barrier Reef, the Mesoamerican Reef and the Coral Triangle -- are jeopardized by the threat of global warming, which kills coral and leads to a bleaching effect.", 
                "And while tourism cannot solve the problem of rising sea temperatures, the industry's cooperation to eliminate specific pressures -- by establishing a well-enforced no-take zone, or reducing wastewater pollution, for example -- helps reefs recover from bleaching and disease.", 
                "The contribution of conservation fees to support the protected areas, which many businesses have long resisted, is also important.", 
                "To keep coral reefs from disappearing as quickly as they have in recent years, people need to be involved and educated on every level from local government to hotel developers to cruise lines, said Sweeting of Conservation International.", 
                "\"It took Cancun 35 years to develop to this massive size, and it took less than a decade for the Riviera Maya,\" he said.", 
                "\"But nature will not let you get away with it."
