                "Mohammad Yusoff said the Chinese fishermen were fined a total of 1.88 million ringgit (US$545,000; euro406,000) after they admitted to the three offenses of encroaching into Malaysian waters and catching two types of protected species -- the green and the hawksbill turtles.", 
                "Instead of paying the fines, all of them went to jail for 18 months -- six months for each offense, he said, confirming reports of the case in the New Straits Times and The Star.",

                "Zoo Atlanta officials said Tuesday they hatched a rare Arakan forest turtle this week, marking the fourth of the brown-and-tan spotted reptiles to be born there.", 
                "The zoo is the only facility in the world successfully breeding the Arakan forest turtle, a species native to Myanmar that is on the list of the world's most critically endangered species.", 
                "They were believed to be extinct for close to a century, but the turtles turned up in Asian food markets in the mid-1990s.", 
                "Scientists blame the rapid disappearance of the Arakan forest turtle -- much like other shelled reptiles -- on their popularity in Asia for cooking and medicinal purposes.", 
                "The turtle, native to the Arakan hills of western Myanmar, has an abysmal survival rate.", 
                "Two of the zoo's four hatchlings have died so far, and scientists say few of the turtles make it through the transport from their natural habitat to zoos and other conservation facilities.", 
                "\"The animals seem to be extremely difficult to establish in captivity,\" said Peter Paul van Dijk, director of the tortoise and freshwater turtle program for Conservation International.", 
                "Though conservationists prefer to preserve endangered animals within their natural habitats, captive breeding programs act as \"as insurance policies,\" particularly with the demand for turtles in Asia, he said.", 
                "\"It's really a tragedy to lose a species that took millions of years to evolve,\" van Dijk said.", 
                "\" There are 12 of the turtles living in captivity in the United States -- at Zoo Atlanta, the St. Louis Zoo, the Miami Metro Zoo and River Banks Zoo and Garden in Columbia, South Carolina.",
