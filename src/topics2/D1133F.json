                "One day after foiling an alleged double car-bomb plot in London, Britain raised its terrorism threat assessment to its highest level on Saturday after two men slammed a Jeep SUV into the departure doors of Glasgow airport, turning the vehicle into a potentially lethal fireball.", 
                "One of the attackers was set ablaze from head to foot, and as he struggled with police, \"was throwing punches and shouting, 'Allah, Allah,\"' an eyewitness said.", 
                "Britain's threat level was set at \"critical,\" meaning that a further attack was considered imminent.", 
                "The threat level has not been that high since last year, after authorities discovered an alleged plot to attack trans-Atlantic airliners with liquid explosives in August.", 
                "A British security official, speaking in return for customary anonymity, said the heightened level reflected an assessment that the London and Glasgow attacks were \"linked in some ways and, therefore, there are clearly individuals who have the capability and intent to carry out further attacks.", 
                "\" The links related to the way the foiled car-bomb attacks in London and the airport attack in Glasgow had been conceived and planned using vehicles and gasoline, the official said.", 
                "Within an hour of the announcement, authorities said the airport in Liverpool had also been closed until further notice, apparently reflecting a fresh area of concern as an increasingly jittery nation braced for further possible episodes.", 
                "In the United States, officials were following the events closely, but the Department of Homeland Security issued a statement from Secretary Michael Chertoff saying there were no plans to raise the national threat level.", 
                "Still, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said additional security measures were being taken at the region's airports, and New York City police were taking steps that included sending officers into parking garages with sensors that detect the presence of chemical, biological or radiological agents.", 
                "Willie Rae, the chief constable of the Strathclyde area around Glasgow, called Saturday's attack an act of terrorism.", 
                "The police said two men were arrested.", 
                "One of the two men in the attack had been injured and had been found to be wearing a \"suspicious device\" when he was taken to a hospital for treatment.", 
                "The hospital was evacuated, the police officer said, but declined to comment on reporters' suggestions that the assailant -- said to be in a critical condition -- had been wearing a suicide bombers' belt.", 
                "The attacks confronted Britain's new prime minister, Gordon Brown, with his first major crisis.", 
                "He summoned two emergency meetings of the high-level security committee called Cobra to try to come to grips with the newest attacks.", 
                "The episodes in London and Scotland deepened foreboding among security experts that Britain was confronting a new threat: the use of relatively unsophisticated, homemade explosive devices to claim lives and spread mayhem."
