                "An international study led by Johns Hopkins University suggests on Monday that the rate of HIV-related dementia is so high in sub-Saharan Africa that HIV dementia along with Alzheimer's disease and dementia from strokes may be among the most common forms of dementia in the world.", 
                "In the first study of HIV dementia on the African continent using rigorous neurological and neuropsychological tests, 31 percent of a small but presumably representative group of HIV-positive patients in Uganda were found to have HIV dementia, according to Ned Sacktor, M.D., a Johns Hopkins neurologist and senior author of a multi-institutional study that will be published Jan. 29 in Neurology.", 
                "HIV dementia is defined as memory, learning, behavioral and motor disabilities that interfere with normal daily life and in extreme cases lead to total disability and a bedridden state.", 
                "Unlike Alzheimer's- and stroke-induced dementia, HIV dementia is treatable and potentially reversible with the same antiretroviral medication that is used to treat the infection.", 
                "Treatment can even restore completely normal cognitive function to some of those affected.", 
                "The study looked at 178 subjects in Kampala, Uganda, from September 2003 to January 2004.", 
                "Seventy-eight were HIV-positive patients recruited from the Infectious Disease Clinic in Mulago Hospital, Makerere University, and 100 were HIV-negative individuals recruited from the AIDs Information Center who were used to obtain normative data for the cognitive tests.", 
                "In diagnosing HIV dementia, researchers looked at medical history and the results of a series of comprehensive neurological and neuropsychological tests and functional assessments.", 
                "\"Clearly, large-scale testing would have to be conducted before we know the global reach of HIV dementia, but this study sends a clear message that it exists in high proportions in sub-Saharan Africa and is an under-recognized condition that needs to be studied and treated,\" Sacktor says.", 
                "Of the estimated 40 million adults and children worldwide who are living with HIV infection, an estimated 27 million live in sub-Saharan Africa, according to Sacktor.", 
                "\"If the rate we saw in our study translates across sub-Saharan Africa, we're looking at more than 8,000,000 people in this region with HIV dementia,\" says Sacktor.", 
                "Sacktor says an extremely high rate of HIV dementia in Africa and other poor regions of the world adds enormously to the social and economic burden of their populations and governments.", 
                "Dementia not only disrupts jobs and adds to the cost of care, but also interferes with a patient's ability to adhere to a regular course of antiretroviral medication, thus increasing the risk of drug resistance.", 
                "\"We hope studies like these will shed additional light on the devastating problem of HIV in resource-limited countries like Uganda and encourage more programs that bring much-needed medication to these poor regions of the world,\" Sacktor says."

                "One study involving 1,500 women in South Africa, Benin, Uganda, and India was stopped this week after an independent safety monitoring board saw more HIV infections among women using the gel than those given a dummy medication.",

                "Previous studies have shown that herpes infections can triple a person's chance of acquiring HIV and can make HIV-positive individuals more infectious.",

                "The placebo group saw their HIV levels spike, from an average of 50,000 virus copies per milliliter of blood to 63,000.", 
                "The treatment group was also less likely to have HIV in their genital tract -- 13 percent had detectable virus levels during each visit, compared with 27 percent in the placebo group.", 
                "The study involved researchers from France, England and Burkina Faso and was funded by the French national AIDS research agency, ANRS.", 
                "One of the study's authors, Dr. Philippe Mayaud of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, called for more research on herpes control methods, including the development of a herpes vaccine.",

                "A larger study funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is under way that aims to be the definitive word on whether treating herpes patients with acyclovir, the first herpes drug, can slow down HIV transmission.", 
                "Some AIDS specialists said it is unlikely herpes drugs will be the first line of defense against AIDS.", 
                "However, they said such treatment could be useful in preventing HIV transmission in Third World countries without access to modern AIDS drugs.", 
                "\"If, heaven forbid, we didn't have treatments for HIV, this would be something we would use.",

                "The researchers led by Philippe Mayaud recruited 140 women infected with both HIV and herpes in the West African nation of Burkina Faso and gave half of the women valacyclovir and the other half women placebo pills for three months.", 
                "The researchers found that copies of HIV in those who received valacyclovir had dropped from 25,000 copies per milliliter of blood to 8,000 per milliliter - a 70 percent reduction and levels of HIV found in the blood of women who received the placebo, by comparison, had increased slightly on average.", 
                "The women who received valacyclovir also had half as many copies of HIV in their genital tracts compared to those who received the placebo, suggesting that valacyclovir has the potential to reduce the spread of HIV, Mayaud said.", 
                "This is the same effect one would expect if the women had been given an anti-HIV drug such as Zidovudine (AZT), according to Mayaud.",

                "Researchers believe that valacyclovir indirectly reduces HIV infection by decreasing copies of the herpes virus and note that untreated herpes can cause lesions in the genital region, which subsequently attract a type of immune cell that harbors HIV.",

                "Trials showing that male circumcision more than halves the risk of HIV infection are published in The Lancet on Friday, giving the seal of approval to calls for circumcision to be cautiously launched as an AIDS prevention strategy.", 
                "The trials, conducted in Kenya and Uganda and earlier in South Africa, found that men who were uncircumcised were twice as likely to catch the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) compared with circumcised counterparts.", 
                "The data were so dramatic that the trials in Kenya and Uganda were halted ahead of schedule, for it would have been ethically wrong to continue them.", 
                "The trials' results were announced by their researchers last year.", 
                "But Friday's publication in the peer-assessed Lancet of the Kenya and Uganda research is the medical community's de-facto validation of the findings, and enshrines circumcision's place in the war against AIDS.", 
                "\"We have proof of a permanent intervention that can reduce the risk of HIV infection in men, which is positive news about prevention after past and current disappointments,\" said a commentary by Marie-Louise Newell and Till Barnighausen of the University of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa and the Harvard School of Public Health.", 
                "They calculate that in KwaZulu-Natal province, where HIV incidence is very high but circumcision rates very low, 35,000 new infections could have been prevented in 2007 alone if the 2.5 million men there had been circumcised.", 
                "In addition to being preventive, circumcision also carries cost benefits.", 
                "The operation is cheap, whereas treatment for HIV infection entails a lifelong dependence on expensive drugs.", 
                "But Newell and Barnighausen join other experts in saying that the urge to swiftly implement circumcision should be leavened with caution.", 
                "Governments and doctors have to tread carefully in advising circumcision, they said.", 
                "In some cultures, circumcision is considered a rite of passage to adulthood and a symbol of manhood; in others, it is considered an emasculation.", 
                "In addition, the operation has to be conducted in sterile conditions by trained personnel, and this will require resources for awareness campaigns and set up medical facilities.", 
                "Most importantly, reduction of risk is not the same as elimination of risk, which means that circumcised men should still be encouraged to wear a condom.", 
                "\"The emerging truth is that no single approach alone will be able to stem the spread of HIV,\" The Lancet said in an editorial.", 
                "Botched operations and the temptations of unsafe sex could squander a historic opportunity, it said.", 
                "In Geneva, the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNAIDS welcomed publication of the trials in Kenya and Uganda.", 
                "\"Male circumcision has major potential for the prevention of HIV infection,\" said Kevin De Cock, director of the WHO's HIV/AIDS department.", 
                "WHO and UNAIDS have convened an international meeting in early March to examine the results of the new trials and assess their impact on AIDS policies.", 
                "The theory behind circumcision's protective effect is that the foreskin has a very thin epithelium, or lining, and easily suffers minor abrasions during intercourse.", 
                "These microscopic cuts make it easier for the AIDS virus to enter the man's bloodstream.", 
                "Another mooted reason is that the foreskin is rich in so-called Langerhans cells whose surface configuration makes it easy for the AIDS virus to latch on to them."

                "The two U.S. studies confirm similar results from an earlier trial in South Africa.", 
                "Given the recent failure of a microbicide trial in Africa and India, and the ongoing difficulties in developing an AIDS vaccine, the potential of circumcision as a new weapon against HIV has become even more significant.",

                "A highly drug-resistant form of tuberculosis has killed about 85 percent of South African HIV patients who have become infected, presenting one of the most worrisome problems in HIV and tuberculosis control, researchers reported Sunday.", 
                "About 330 cases of extensively drug-resistant, or ``XDR,'' tuberculosis have been verified in South Africa over the past year, said Karin Weyer of the South African Medical Research Council in Pretoria.", 
                "The outbreak began in KwaZulu-Natal province last year and is found throughout the country, she said.", 
                "Dr. Paul Nunn, coordinator of tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus at the World Health Organization, called the 85 percent mortality rate ``completely egregious.", 
                "'' The South African findings were presented at the opening here of the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Diseases.", 
                "It is the largest scientific gathering for researchers of acquired immune deficiency syndrome.", 
                "XDR tuberculosis is resistant to many drugs, although it can be treated with four antibiotics if caught early enough.", 
                "``This creates a huge challenge in terms of infection control, especially in settings where a high numbers of HIV-positive individuals are converging,'' such as hospitals, Weyer said.", 
                "Doctors have seen sporadic cases for decades, but the XDR form gained attention after the outbreak in KwaZulu-Natal province.", 
                "The World Health Organization has reported that the number of countries with XDR tuberculosis has increased from 17 in March to 28 at present.", 
                "Some of the most affected areas include South Africa, South Korea and parts of Eastern Europe, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.", 
                "The disease can kill with surprising speed, particularly among HIV patients, whose immune systems are weakened.", 
                "Researchers reported last year that median survival time for patients in one study was 25 days following their diagnosis.", 
                "Weyer said the disease appears in about 10 percent of patients with a less severe form of tuberculosis known as ``multi-drug resistant.", 
                "'' XDR tuberculosis has appeared in the U.S. but at much lower levels.", 
                "Since 1993, there have been 47 cases in the U.S., resulting in 13 deaths, said Dr. Kevin Fenton, director of the CDC's National Center for HIV, STD (Sexually Transmitted Diseases) and TB Prevention.", 
                "The death rate is still six times higher than the typical rate for tuberculosis, he said.", 
                "Resistance testing is widespread in the U.S., but Fenton said the South African cases are a ``wake-up call'' for strengthening TB surveillance and prevention.", 
                "He said there are large numbers of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis cases in China, Russia and India, providing more opportunities for the development of XDR tuberculosis.", 
                "``We increasingly live in small world,'' he said.", 
                "``With foreign travel and migration to the U.S., we have to be very much aware of emerging threats of XDR TB."
