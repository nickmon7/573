                "New York broker Bernard Madoff's alleged giant pyramid scheme duped some of the world's smartest investors, reports suggested Saturday, adding to questions about why the scam wasn't uncovered earlier.", 
                "Evidence emerged that Madoff's alleged multi-billion-dollar fraud stretched from Tokyo to Europe to top US investors, all of them apparently unaware until the broker's arrest Thursday that they were being conned.", 
                "Prosecutors allege that Madoff, a decades-long veteran of Wall Street and pillar of the US financial community, confessed to losing at least 50 billion dollars in the so-called Ponzi scheme, or pyramid fraud.", 
                "US newspapers detailed how Madoff, 70, traded on his impeccable reputation and access to exclusive country clubs to cultivate A-list investment clients including big banks, hedge funds and individuals.", 
                "The Securities and Exchange Commission alleges he delivered consistently strong returns by secretly using the principal from new investors to pay out to other investors.", 
                "As long as he could attract new investors the alleged scheme worked.", 
                "The plot appears to have unraveled when clients asked to withdraw their principal -- as they have been doing from hedge funds worldwide -- only to discover that Madoff's seemingly brimming coffers were empty.", 
                "According to The Wall Street Journal, investors facing losses include French bank BNP Paribas, Tokyo-based Nomura Holdings and Zurich's Neue Privat Bank.", 
                "Spanish newspapers reported that a fund run by leading bank Santander was heavily exposed and that investors in Spain risk losing some three billion dollars.", 
                "Swiss bankers face losses of up to five billion dollars, Geneva's Le Temps newspaper said.", 
                "The report said that Union Bancaire Privee, a major asset management institution specializing in hedge funds, could be exposed to the tune of one billion dollars.", 
                "UBP refused to comment on the report, which said that 90 percent of fund management companies operating in Geneva invested in Madoff products.", 
                "Top-drawer US investors who were taken in included the former owner of the Philadelphia Eagles American football team Norman Braman, according to news reports.", 
                "Hedge funds are likely to take an especially big hit because Madoff was handling money for several companies raising money for such funds, the Journal said.", 
                "\"I'm wiped out,\" the Journal quoted Sandra Manzke, chairman of one such company, Maxam Capital Management, as saying after reporting 280 million dollars in losses.", 
                "The New York Times reported that a hedge fund advisory firm, Fairfield Greenwich Group, had invested 7.5 billion dollars with Madoff.", 
                "As federal investigators poured over the books at Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, the Times highlighted the apparent lack of oversight through the years of what appears set to be Wall Street's record-sized fraud.", 
                "Despite Madoff's amazingly high and consistent returns and the fact that a relatively unknown accounting firm was doing his audits, the Securities and Exchange Commission \"appears to have been completely surprised,\" the Times wrote.", 
                "\"Despite these and other red flags, hedge fund companies kept promoting Mr Madoff\u2019s funds to other funds and individuals,\" the Times wrote.", 
                "Among those recruiting investors on Madoff's behalf, the Times reported, were Japan's Nomura.", 
                "The debacle has \"swept up some of the most prominent and wealthy Americans, along with many people who thought they were embarking on a comfortable retirement and have now been left destitute,\" the Journal quoted a lawyer for another victim, Milberg LLP, as saying."

                "Ira Lee Sorkin, an attorney for Madoff, said Madoff's firm \"is cooperating fully with the government.", 
                "\" \"We're disturbed about these unfortunate events that have led to this,\" Sorkin said.", 
                "He declined to say whether Madoff, who has been released on bail, will fight the charges.", 
                "Madoff, 70, made his fortune as a middleman between buyers and sellers of stock.", 
                "He helped pioneer electronic trading as an alternative to the New York Stock Exchange, where buyers and sellers meet in person, and he eventually became chairman of Nasdaq, the first electronic stock exchange.", 
                "Madoff built himself into a brand.", 
                "He came to Wall Street with money saved as a Long Island lifeguard and built a family business employing many relatives, including his sons, and refused to sell the business or take it public.", 
                "He advertised his integrity.", 
                "\"In an era of faceless organizations owned by other equally faceless organizations, Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC harks back to an earlier era in the financial world: The owner's name is on the door,\" the company's Web site said.", 
                "\"Clients know that Bernard Madoff has a personal interest in maintaining the unblemished record of value, fair-dealing, and high ethical standards that has always been the firm's hallmark.", 
                "\" By the late 1970s, and perhaps earlier, Madoff began managing money for investors, at least in part because he could require people to process trades through his firm.", 
                "Madoff eventually attracted billions of dollars from investors.", 
                "Some he knew personally.", 
                "Others belonged to clubs he was a member of, including the Palm Beach Country Club in Florida and Glen Oaks Country Club in New York.", 
                "Several large hedge funds invested with Madoff in part because he did not charge traditional fees, instead collecting money solely for processing trades.", 
                "The key attraction, however, was Madoff's remarkably successful track record.", 
                "A hedge fund run by Madoff, which described its strategy as focused on shares in the Standard &amp; Poor's 100-stock index, averaged a 10.5 percent annual return over the past 17 years.", 
                "This year, amid a general market collapse, the fund reported that it was up 5.6 percent through November, while the S&amp;P 500-stock index fell 38 percent.", 
                "The SEC charged in its complaint that the returns were artificial.", 
                "Madoff at some point started paying investors with money received from other investors, a Ponzi scheme, according to the SEC.", 
                "\"Mr. Madoff lured investors to entrust him with substantial sums of money -- in some cases massive amounts of money -- with the false promise of great interest returns,\" said Mark Mulholland, a New York lawyer who filed a class-action lawsuit Thursday against Madoff.", 
                "He said his firm has been approached by two dozen investors, who lost up to $90 million.", 
                "The SEC said it is not clear when Madoff started using new investments to create the appearance of profits.", 
                "But the alleged ruse was finally exposed by the global financial crisis.", 
                "Madoff's investors had requested the return of about $7 billion by the end of the year, part of a broad trend in which investors are pulling massive sums from Wall Street.", 
                "Madoff told one of his sons earlier this month that he was struggling to find the money.", 
                "Then he told his other son that he was ready to pay annual bonuses to employees.", 
                "The sons confronted their father Wednesday, according to authorities, asking how the firm could pay bonuses if it couldn't pay investors.", 
                "Madoff asked them to come to his apartment, saying \"he wasn't sure he would be able to hold it together\" at the office, the SEC said.", 
                "There he said he was \"finished.", 
                "\" The business was \"a giant Ponzi scheme\" -- \"all just one big lie,\" the SEC documents said.",

                "Friday, a federal judge placed the company in receivership at the SEC's request.", 
                "Outside analysts had raised concerns about Madoff's firm for years.", 
                "The company made its own trades and held the shares it bought, unusual practices that kept its activities hidden from view.", 
                "Madoff also avoided filing disclosures of its holdings with the SEC; the firm said that at the end of every reporting period it sold its holdings and held only cash.", 
                "Such a tactic is highly unusual because it exposes a fund to large losses by forcing it to sell assets without regard to price.", 
                "Madoff, though a pioneer of electronic trading, also refused to provide clients online access to their accounts.", 
                "\"This was extremely secretive, even for the non-transparent world of hedge funds,\" said Jake Walthour Jr., head of advisory services for Aksia, a New York consulting firm that advised clients not to invest in Madoff's funds.", 
                "\"It was all done almost in fortress fashion to prevent anyone from knowing what was going on.", 
                "\" But a large number of investors apparently could not resist.", 
                "Robert Lappin started investing with Madoff in the early 1990s and eventually entrusted him with the entirety of his family foundation.", 
                "The Lappin Foundation, created \"to keep our children Jewish,\" gave about $1.5 million to Jewish groups in 2007, including a long-standing program that has paid for about 1,800 teenagers to visit Israel.", 
                "Coltin, the executive director, went to sleep Thursday night with an inkling of bad news and woke up at 6 a.m. Friday, planning to call Lappin.",

                "\"He said: `I have to tell you this.", 
                "Our funds are frozen,' \" Coltin said.", 
                "A little bit later, it became clear that the money had melted away."

                "Spain's largest bank, Santander, said Sunday an investment fund subsidiary may have lost more than three billion dollars in the scandal involving New York trader Bernard Madoff, and other major European lenders admitted they too have suffered.", 
                "Madoff is alleged to have lost 50 billion dollars in a giant pyramid scheme that collapsed in the global financial crisis.", 
                "Santander said its investment fund Optimal has an exposure of 2.33 billion euros (3.1 billion dollars).", 
                "The bank said it had also invested 17 million euros of its own funds in Madoff products.", 
                "French bank BNP Paribas also revealed it could lose up to 350 million euros (470 million dollars) in the scandal.", 
                "A BNP Paribas said the bank had no direct investment with Madoff's company but \"it does have risk exposure to these funds through its trading business and collateralized lending to funds of hedge funds.", 
                "\"If, as a result of the alleged fraud, the value of the assets of these hedge funds is nil, BNP Paribas' loss could amount to around 350 million euros.", 
                "\" In Britain, a spokeswoman for Royal Bank of Scotland told AFP the bank had \"some exposure\" to Madoff, but declined to give details.", 
                "European media have said HSBC of Britain and Union Bancaire Privee of Switzerland could also have suffered, although neither has admitted or denied losing money.", 
                "A British investment fund that also acknowledged being a Madoff client criticised what it called the \"systemic failure\" of US regulators.", 
                "Bramdean Alternatives Limited said the accusations against Madoff raised \"fundamental questions\" about the American financial regulatory system.", 
                "\"It is astonishing that this apparent fraud seems to have been continuing for so long, possibly for decades, while investors have continued to invest more money into the Madoff funds in good faith,\" the firm said in a statement.", 
                "Bramdean Alternatives invested around 21 million pounds (23.3 million euros, 31.2 million dollars), or around 9.5 percent of its portfolio, with Madoff's company.", 
                "British newspapers reported that among Bramdean's clients is property magnate Vincent Tchenguiz, one of Britain's richest men, who apparently invested 40 million pounds with the firm.",

                "It said Union Bancaire Privee, a major asset management institution specialising in hedge funds, could be exposed to the tune of one billion dollars.", 
                "UBP refused to comment on the report, which said that 90 percent of fund management companies operating in Geneva invested in products of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC.", 
                "Italy's stock market watchdog, the Consob, has launched an investigation into the impact of the scandal on the national financial system, Ansa news agency reported.",

                "The Madoff scandal could have a bigger impact in Spain than the collapse of US bank Lehman Brothers this year, in which Spanish investors had exposure of between 1.3 and 2.6 billion euros.", 
                "Madoff was arrested on Thursday for allegedly defrauding his customers through a giant pyramid scheme, with prosecutors alleging that the 70-year-old, a Wall Street veteran, confessed to losing at least 50 billion dollars."

                "Banks and financial authorities across Europe scrambled Sunday to uncover the scope of losses suffered at the hands of New York investment broker Bernard Madoff.", 
                "Madoff is alleged to have lost 50 billion dollars in a giant pyramid scheme that collapsed in the global financial crisis and top European banks are reported to be clients.", 
                "Italy's stock market watchdog, the Consob, has launched an investigation into the impact of the scandal on the national financial system, Ansa news agency reported.", 
                "A spokeswoman for Royal Bank of Scotland told AFP that the bank had \"some exposure\" to Madoff's company, but declined to give details.", 
                "A British investment fund that also acknowledged being a Madoff client criticised what it called the \"systemic failure\" of US regulators.", 
                "Bramdean Alternatives Limited said the accusations against Madoff raised \"fundamental questions\" about the American financial regulatory system.", 
                "\"It is astonishing that this apparent fraud seems to have been continuing for so long, possibly for decades, while investors have continued to invest more money into the Madoff funds in good faith,\" the firm said in a statement.", 
                "Bramdean Alternatives invested around 21 million pounds (23.3 million euros, 31.2 million dollars), or around 9.5 percent of its portfolio, with Madoff's company.", 
                "British newspapers reported that among Bramdean's clients is property magnate Vincent Tchenguiz, one of Britain's richest men, who apparently invested 40 million pounds with the firm.", 
                "European media have said Banco Santander of Spain, BNPParibas of France, HSBC of Britain and Union Bancaire Privee of Switzerland could all have suffered.", 
                "None has admitted or denied losing money.", 
                "Swiss bankers face losses of up to five billion dollars (3.7 billion euros), Geneva's Le Temps newspaper said.", 
                "It said Union Bancaire Privee, a major asset management institution specialising in hedge funds, could be exposed to the tune of one billion dollars.", 
                "UBP refused to comment on the report, which said that 90 percent of fund management companies operating in Geneva invested in products of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC.", 
                "The Bank of Spain also opened an investigation to determine the level of involvement of Spanish companies, the Spanish daily El Mundo said.", 
                "The only official statement has come from Spain's second largest bank, BBVA, which said it had not commercialised \"any Madoff product.", 
                "\" Spanish newspapers reported that Optimal, an investment firm of Banco Santander, was heavily exposed and that investors risked losing some three billion dollars.", 
                "Santander, Europe's second largest bank, has made no comment.", 
                "Spanish authorities are taking the scandal very seriously and the central bank began an investigation on the impact on Friday, El Mundo said.", 
                "If the figures are confirmed, the fraud could have a bigger impact in Spain than the collapse of US bank Lehman Brothers this year, in which Spanish investors had exposure of between 1.3 and 2.6 billion euros.", 
                "Europe's largest bank, HSBC, meanwhile, declined to confirm any relationship with the alleged fraudster.", 
                "BNP Paribas also refused to comment on reports that it had invested with Madoff.", 
                "Madoff was arrested on Thursday for allegedly defrauding his customers through a giant pyramid scheme, with prosecutors alleging that the 70-year-old, a Wall Street veteran, confessed to losing at least 50 billion dollars."

                "The epicenter of what may be the largest Ponzi scheme in history was the 17th floor of the Lipstick Building, an oval red-granite building rising 34 floors above Third Avenue in Midtown Manhattan.", 
                "A busy stock-trading operation occupied the 19th floor, and the computers and paperwork filled the 18th floor of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities.", 
                "But the 17th floor was Bernie Madoff's sanctum, occupied by fewer than two dozen staff members and rarely visited by other employees.", 
                "They called it the \"hedge fund\" floor, but federal prosecutors now say the work Madoff did there was actually a fraud scheme whose losses Madoff himself estimates at $50 billion.", 
                "The tally of reported losses climbed through the weekend to nearly $20 billion, with a giant Spanish bank, Banco Santander, reporting Sunday that clients of one of its Swiss subsidiaries have lost $3 billion.", 
                "Some of the biggest losers were members of the Palm Beach Country Club, where many of Madoff's wealthy clients were recruited.", 
                "The list of prominent victims grew as well.", 
                "According to a person familiar with the business of the real estate and publishing magnate Mort Zuckerman, he is also on a list of victims that already included the owners of the New York Mets, a former owner of the Philadelphia Eagles and the chairman of GMAC.", 
                "And the 17th floor is now an occupied zone, as investigators and forensic auditors try to piece together what Madoff did with the billions entrusted to him by individuals, banks and hedge funds around the world.", 
                "So far, only Madoff, the firm's 70-year-old founder, has been arrested in the scandal.", 
                "He is free on a $10 million bond and cannot travel far outside the New York area.", 
                "But a question still dominates the investigation: How one person could have pulled off such a far-reaching, long-running fraud, carrying out all the simple practical chores the scheme required, like producing monthly statements, annual tax statements, trade confirmations and bank transfers.", 
                "Firms managing money on Madoff's scale would typically have hundreds of people involved in these administrative tasks.", 
                "Prosecutors say he claims to have acted entirely alone.", 
                "\"Our task is to find the records and follow the money,\" said Alexander Vasilescu, a lawyer in the New York office of the Securities and Exchange Commission.", 
                "As of Sunday night, he said, investigators could not shed much light on the fraud or its scale.", 
                "\"We do not dispute his number -- we just have not calculated how he made it,\" he said.", 
                "Scrutiny is also falling on the many banks and money managers who helped steer clients to Madoff and now say they are among his victims.", 
                "While many investors were friends or met Madoff at country clubs or on charitable boards, even more had entrusted their money to professional advisory firms that, in turn, handed it on to Madoff -- for a fee.", 
                "Investors are now questioning whether these paid advisers were diligent enough in investigating Madoff to ensure that their money was safe.", 
                "Where those advisers work for big institutions like Banco Santander, investors will most likely look to them, rather than to the remnants of Madoff's firm, for restitution.", 
                "Santander may face $3.1 billion in losses through its Optimal Investment Services, a Geneva-based fund of hedge funds that is owned by the bank.", 
                "At the end of 2007, Optimal had 6 billion euros, or $8 billion, under management, according to the bank's annual report -- which would mean that its Madoff investments were a substantial part of Optimal's portfolio.", 
                "A spokesman for Santander declined to comment on the case.", 
                "Other Swiss institutions, including Banque Benedict Hentsch and Neue Privat Bank, acknowledged being at risk, with Hentsch confirming about $48 million in exposure.", 
                "BNP Paribas said it had not invested directly in the Madoff funds but had 350 million euros, or about $500 million, at risk through trades and loans to hedge funds.", 
                "And the private Swiss bank Reichmuth said it had 385 million Swiss francs, or $327 million, in potential losses.", 
                "HSBC, one of the world's largest banks, also said it had made loans to institutions that invested in Madoff but did not disclose the size of its potential losses.", 
                "Losses of this scale simply do not seem to fit into the intimate business that Madoff operated in New York.", 
                "With just more than 200 employees, it was tight-knit and friendly, according to current and former employees.", 
                "Madoff was gregarious and empathetic, known for visiting sick employees in their hospitals and hosting warmly generous staff parties.", 
                "By the elevated standards of Wall Street, the Madoff firm did not pay exceptionally well, but it was loyal to employees even in bad times.", 
                "Madoff's family filled the senior positions, but his was not the only family at the firm -- generations of employees had worked for Madoff.", 
                "Even before Madoff collapsed, some employees were mystified by the 17th floor.", 
                "In recent regulatory filings, Madoff claimed to manage $17 billion for clients -- a number that would normally occupy a staff of at least 200 employees, far more than the 20 or so who worked on 17.", 
                "One Madoff employee said he and other workers assumed that Madoff must have a separate office elsewhere to oversee his client accounts.", 
                "Nevertheless, Madoff attracted and held the trust of companies that prided themselves on their diligent investigation of investment managers.", 
                "One of them was Walter M. Noel Jr., who struck up a business relationship with Madoff 20 years ago that helped earn his investment firm, the Fairfield Greenwich Group, millions of dollars in fees.", 
                "Indeed, over time, one Fairfield's strongest selling points for its largest fund was its access to Madoff.", 
                "But now, Noel and Fairfield are the biggest known losers in the scandal, facing potential losses of $7.5 billion, more than half its assets.", 
                "Jeffrey Tucker, a Fairfield co-founder and former federal regulator, said in a statement posted on the firm's Web site: \"We have worked with Madoff for nearly 20 years, investing alongside our clients.", 
                "We had no indication that we and many other firms and private investors were the victims of such a highly sophisticated, massive fraudulent scheme.", 
                "\" The huge loss comes at a time when the hedge fund industry has already been wounded by the volatile markets.", 
                "Several weeks ago, Fairfield had halted investor redemptions at two of its other funds, citing the tough market conditions as dozens of hedge funds have done.", 
                "The firm reported a drop of $2 billion in assets between September and November.", 
                "Fairfield was founded in 1983 by Noel, the former head of international private banking at Chemical Bank, and Tucker, a former Securities and Exchange Commission official.", 
                "It grew dramatically over the years, attracting investors in Europe, Latin America and Asia.", 
                "Noel first met Madoff in the 1980s, and Fairfield's fortunes grew along with the returns Madoff reported.", 
                "The two men were very different: Madoff hailed from eastern Queens and was tied closely to the Jewish community, while Noel, a native of Tennessee, moved in the Greenwich social scene with his wife, Monica.", 
                "\"Walter was always really confident in Bernie and the strategy he employed,\" said one hedge fund manager who declined to be named because for fear of jeopardizing his relationship with Noel.", 
                "\"He was a person of superb ethics, and this has to cut him to the quick,\" said George L. Ball, a former executive at E. F. Hutton and Prudential-Bache Securities who knows Mr. Noel.", 
                "Fairfield touted its investigative skills.", 
                "On its Web site, the firm claimed to investigate hedge fund managers for six to 12 months before investing.", 
                "As part of the process, a team of examiners conducted personal background checks, audited brokerage records and trading reports and interviewed hedge fund executives and compliance officials.", 
                "In 2001, Madoff called Fairfield and invited the firm to inspect his books after two news reports questioned the validity of his returns, according to a person close to Fairfield.", 
                "Outside auditors hired to inspect Madoff's operations concluded that \"everything checked out,\" this person said.", 
                "\"FGG performed comprehensive and conscientious due diligence and risk monitoring,\" Marc Kasowitz, a lawyer for Fairfield, said in a statement.", 
                "\"FGG like so many other Madoff clients was a victim of a highly-sophisticated massive fraud that escaped the detection of top institutional and private investors, industry organizations, auditors, examiners, and regulatory authorities.", 
                "\" Now, Fairfield is seeking to recover what it can from Madoff.", 
                "\"It is our intention to aggressively pursue the recovery of all assets related to Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities,\" Tucker said in a statement.", 
                "Working alongside the federal investigators on Madoff's 17th floor, staffers for Lee S. Richards 3d, the court-appointed receiver for the firm, are trying to determine what parts of the firm can keep operating to preserve assets for investors.", 
                "A hotline number had been posted on the company Web site, madoff.com, but on Sunday night, Richards said that there was little reason to call.", 
                "\"We don't have anything to report to investors at this time,\" he said.", 
                "\"We are doing everything we can to protect the assets of the Madoff entities that are subject to the receivership, and to learn what we can about the operations of those entities."
