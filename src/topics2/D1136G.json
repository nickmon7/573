                "The report also predicted that more floods and droughts will hit the country as water evaporates more rapidly from rivers.", 
                "The Yellow River, China's second longest, will see evaporation increase by 15 percent a year, it said.",

                "Yangtze water levels hit a record low in 2006, while its tributaries dropped 30 to 60 percent below average levels, according to the bureau.", 
                "The flow at Yichang City, where the Three Gorges dam is located, was 284.4 billion cubic meters last year, 64 percent of the average, the lowest since 1877 when records began.", 
                "The level in the Three Gorges reservoir reached the 156-meter mark in October with a storage of 8.65 billion cubic meters in 2006, three percent of the total water flow in the city, according to the bureau.", 
                "Even if the reservoir had stored no water, the flow at Yichang City would have hit a record low, said Cheng Haiyun, bureau chief engineer.", 
                "Begun in 1993 and costing an estimated 180 billion yuan (23 billion U.S. dollars), the Three Gorges Project on the middle reaches of the river will have 26 generators when it is completed in 2009 and be able to generate 84.7 billion kwh of electricity annually."

                "Heatwaves hit Chongqing municipality and Sichuan province in the upper Yangtze last summer, and rainfall was nearly halved in most sections of the Yangtze, resulting in a severe drought.", 
                "Water in the upper reaches decreased by over 60 percent from the previous year, and cities downstream reported the lowest water levels since records were first kept in 1877.", 
                "\"Previously we had to prepare for floods, but the drought has changed all that,\" said Zhou Jinyun, director of the fishery bureau in the port city of Anqing, in east China's Anhui Province, in the middle reaches of the river.", 
                "In Anqing, the water is only four meters deep, and will continue to drop as the drought continues, Zhou said.", 
                "But in fact the drought is only part of the story of the Yangtze's sad decline.", 
                "Over 9,000 chemical plants line the banks of China's longest waterway, 45 percent of the national total.", 
                "Dongting Lake, China's second largest freshwater lake in central China's Hunan province, which is fed by the Yangtze, has to absorb discharges from over 230 paper-making factories.", 
                "As the once-mighty Yangtze threads its way through 11 regions in China, water is intensively siphoned off for factories, hydroelectric schemes and agriculture.", 
                "And when the factories release water back into the river, it is full of pollutants, leading to a series of pollution and chemical accidents in recent years.", 
                "\"This is the worst water shortage I've seen in my thirty years experience as a marine worker,\" said Huang Yongming, head of the Maritime Bureau in the neighboring Tongling city.",

                "Water resource authorities in Hankou, Hubei province, have had to add chlorides to purify drinking water for residents in the city.", 
                "The water shortage has affected the whole ecology of the Yangtze.", 
                "\"Dwindling water reserves have made it harder for fish to survive, including endangered species like baiji, or white-flag dolphins, and increased the risks of them being injured by passing ships,\" said Wang Zhenxi, director of fishery management in Tongling, Anhui province.", 
                "Wang said they had found some fish, including finless porpoises, maimed by ship propellers and with their skulls shattered.", 
                "Low water levels in the river have made it impossible for some fish species to migrate back to the sea, threatening their survival in shallow waters.",

                "The annual per capita income of over 50,000 fishermen around Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China, was less than 600 yuan (about 77 U.S. dollars), only one fifth of their earning in previous years.", 
                "Meanwhile, the shipping industry along the Yangtze is also feeling the effects of the water shortage.", 
                "Water depth at Yichang and Jingjiang in the middle reaches of the river no longer reaches the navigation standard of 2.9 meters.", 
                "Local maritime authorities have dispatched dredgers to dig out sludge, and in some places, they took the drastic step of exploding reefs to make navigation possible.", 
                "Large vessels were ordered to unload shipments or banned from navigation to ease the traffic jam caused by shrinking waterways.",

                "1 greenhouse gas emitter in the next decade.", 
                "It wants to reduce its dependence on coal but converting to cleaner energies on a mass scale would be prohibitively costly for China, which is still a developing economy.", 
                "It also \"lags behind Europe and the United States\" in the technology needed to burn cleaner coal, which accounts for 69 percent of its energy output, said Qin Dahe, chief of the China Meteorological Administration, and an adviser to the government on climate change.", 
                "\"It takes time to catch up,\" he said at a news conference.", 
                "Qin served as one of China's representatives to the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which last week announced that global warming is very likely caused by mankind and that climate change will continue for centuries.", 
                "He said China agreed with and was concerned about the report's conclusions.", 
                "China, like the rest of the world, will increasingly face problems of extreme temperatures, rising sea levels, drought and more intense typhoons because of the effects of global warming, he said.", 
                "Qin's comments come as winter temperatures in China's capital have hit a 30-year high, state media said.", 
                "Qin and other scientists are preparing to brief the central government on climate change based on the findings of the UN study.", 
                "They would recommend that China invest more in research and observation of weather patterns and climate change and promote environmental awareness, Qin said.", 
                "He said the central government had already set a \"very ambitious and arduous goal\" of reducing carbon dioxide and other emissions by 4 percent a year over the next five years.", 
                "The central government is \"very serious about the commitment and has firmly demanded all regions to meet the emissions reduction targets,\" he said.", 
                "However, China has no binding international commitments to reduce its emissions and failed to meet similar targets set by the government five years ago.", 
                "Last month, state media reported that some regions were suspected of submitting fake data on emissions in 2006.", 
                "A separate Chinese report released last month said climate change could cause large drops in agricultural output over the coming decades.", 
                "In the latter half of this century production of wheat, corn and rice in China will drop by as much as 37 percent, and the country's average temperatures would rise by 2 or 3 degrees Celsius in the next 50 to 80 years, the report said.", 
                "It also said evaporation rates for some inland rivers would increase by 15 percent.",

                "Qingdao, Yantai, Binzhou and a few other cities will benefit from the project, according to the plan.", 
                "Like many Chinese regions, Shandong is suffering a worsening water shortage, but its 3,024 kilometers of coastline offers the solution of desalinating sea water.", 
                "Shandong currently has 16 plants desalinating 32,000 cubic meters of sea water per day, 57 percent of the country's total.", 
                "Besides sea water desalination, Shandong is seeking more fresh water through China's mammoth south-to-north water diversion program and the water diversion program of the Yellow River.", 
                "The water resources in Shandong meet only one third of the province's demand.", 
                "According to the State Development and Reform Commission and some other state- level agencies, desalinated seawater is expected to contribute 16 to 24 percent of the water supply in coastal areas by 2010, with a daily processing capacity of up to 3 million cubic meters in 2020.", 
                "China is among the driest countries in the world, and 400 out of 600 Chinese cities suffer from water shortages for domestic and industrial uses."

                "Severe drought has had a debilitating effect on the Yangtze River, China's longest waterway, over the last two weeks, leaving at least 1 million people in Chongqing Municipality with water shortages, local water authorities said on Monday.", 
                "A spokesman of Shapingba Waterworks, one of the largest drinking water suppliers in the city center, told Xinhua that only one of its 10 pipes used to pump water from the Yangtze was still below the water surface and in operation - and that is only 10 cm below the water level.", 
                "\"If the water levels in the Yangtze and its upper tributary Jialing River continue to decline, we'll face a real crisis,\" he said.", 
                "The municipal drought control authority has sent water wagons to the drought-hit areas to provide water for humans and cattle and has told local governments to build up reserves.", 
                "The local hydrological bureau said water levels in the Yangtze and Jialing rivers had declined sharply in recent weeks due to a lack of rainfall.", 
                "It follows last summer's severe drought that forced tens of thousands of farmers to eke out a living away from home - many ended up picking cotton in northwestern Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.", 
                "On Sunday, the water level at Cuntan hydrological station in Chongqing measured 158.43 meters, only 35 centimeters higher than the record low reported in 1987, said a bureau spokesman surnamed Wang.", 
                "Wang blamed a glut of power plants in the Yangtze's upper reaches for the decline in water, but did not link the water shortages with the operation of the Three Gorges Dam, which is located in the lower reaches of the Yangtze.", 
                "Sources with the China Three Gorges Project Corporation said the water shortage in the upper reaches had not affected the world's largest water storage facility.", 
                "The flow of water into the dam measured 3,700 cubic meters per second and the water level at the dam was 153.43 meters on Sunday afternoon, which safeguard the operation of the dam and navigation in the lower reaches, they said.", 
                "But the declining water level in Chongqing has played havoc with navigation and a cargo ship carrying 1,400 tons of timber was stranded on Sunday close to Chongqing's Xinggang port.", 
                "The salvage operation lasted five hours.", 
                "On Monday, the local maritime bureau suspended navigation in the area between 12:30 p.m. and 2:30 p.m. every day for surveying and dredging.", 
                "\"The Yangtze suffers drought almost every spring, but this year's situation is worse than normal,\" said a sailor, adding the water level at Chaotianmen Wharf in central Chongqing was \"lower by at least one meter\" compared with last year.", 
                "The exposed riverbed near the wharf has become a temporary playground for locals to sunbathe and fly kites.", 
                "The Chongqing municipal flood control and drought relief office said it planned to ease the drought through artificial rainfall.", 
                "The office predicted the drought would last until after the rainy season begins in May, but will return in the middle of summer and will last for at least 30 days.", 
                "Water conservation experts believe most parts of Chongqing will receive between 1,000 and 1,300 millimeters of rainfall this year, slightly more than in recent years.", 
                "But a severe drought is still likely to affect the southeastern part of the city in mid July.", 
                "Chongqing and neighboring Sichuan Province in the upper reaches of the Yangtze suffered their worst water shortages in more than a century last summer when the water level and rainfall nearly halved.", 
                "The Yangtze River, the third longest in the world after the Nile and the Amazon, runs from far west Qinghai and Tibet through 186 cities including Chongqing, Wuhan and Nanjing before emptying into the sea in Shanghai.", 
                "The total gross domestic product (GDP) of all cities along the Yangtze River accounts for 41 percent of the national total, according to government statistics."
