                "Rescuers used listening devices, heat detection and specially trained dogs to search for anyone else possibly trapped in rubble, Bloomberg said.",

                "Officials said about 250 cranes were in operation in the five boroughs, a telling sign of the city's building boom.", 
                "Construction cranes are towering behemoths, signposts of the city's prosperity that dominate the skyline for months but often go unnoticed.", 
                "Yet on Sunday, those who lived, worked or happened to be walking near the cranes, their nerves rattled by Saturday's collapse, looked upward with anxiety.", 
                "The gas station cashier who works directly below a crane at West 24th Street and 10th Avenue said he trusted God to protect him.", 
                "Ana Goncalves, who lives across the street, puts her faith in the builders and hopes they know what they are doing.", 
                "Victor Simpkins, another neighbor, has watched the crane for weeks, but now he looks up at it with a new suspicion.",

                "On Sunday, city officials released a detailed description of the collapse at 303 E. 51st St., saying workers were \"jumping\" the crane -- intricately adding sections to raise the crane higher -- when a steel collar used to secure the crane to the side of the building fell.", 
                "That piece sheared off a lower collar and the entire structure toppled, the city officials said.", 
                "The authorities said 24 people were injured, including 11 first responders, and at least three people remained missing: two construction workers and a woman who was inside the four-story town house at 305 E. 50th St. that was demolished.", 
                "Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg acknowledged the danger of high-rise construction but said residents near cranes were generally safe.",

                "As the city's Department of Buildings defines them, \"accidents\" involve fatalities or injuries, and \"incidents\" do not.", 
                "The collapse Saturday of the 205-foot crane -- described by city and union officials as one of the worst crane accidents in memory -- gave rise to a grim New York City parlor game, one that pedestrians have doubtlessly played in the back of their minds over the years: If that crane over there fell, where would it hit?", 
                "\"We thought about it, and we think if it falls, it will probably fall into the park or bounce off that clock tower,\" said Jarrod Shandley, 25, who lives with two roommates in a penthouse that looks out onto a crane at East 23rd Street and Madison Avenue.", 
                "Boom, jib, cab -- cranes have their own New York vernacular.", 
                "Like New Yorkers, they come in all shapes and sizes, but the ones that dominate in Manhattan are tower cranes, which are used in the construction of tall buildings.", 
                "Still, Sunday, virtually every crane in the city -- no matter its safety record or soundness -- was looked upon with skepticism by many pedestrians and residents.", 
                "Yet, it was perhaps a testament to the city's reliance upon cranes that workers at the accident site were using other cranes to stabilize and assess the one that toppled.", 
                "At East 23rd Street, the giant white crane fixed to the building under construction was the talk of the neighborhood.", 
                "Lynn Catanio, 56, and her 28-year-old daughter walked beneath the crane and the blue scaffolding surrounding the building about noon.", 
                "\"We just walked by and said, 'If it falls, would it take her building out?",

                "They decided she would be safe.", 
                "Stan Hochman, 83, who walked by the crane with his wife, said it made him nervous.", 
                "\"I don't know what can be done about it,\" he said.", 
                "\"You could walk across the street,\" his wife, Lee, 79, said.", 
                "\"I think a crane like that could still reach you across the street,\" he responded.", 
                "Some New Yorkers showed no fear of cranes.",

                "Neighborhood residents said the boom of the crane often swings over the gas station to pick up materials on 24th Street.", 
                "Goncalves, 33, used to live across the street from another crane in the East Village in 2006.", 
                "One day that September, a four-ton chunk of steel rigging from the crane fell 20 stories to the ground, crashing onto a cab, injuring five people and forcing evacuations.", 
                "Now she lives in a five-story building across from the crane at 245 10th Ave., and Saturday's collapse and her memories of the one in 2006 have made her uneasy.", 
                "\"It crosses my mind every day,\" said Goncalves of the stability of the crane.",

                "The spectacular collapse of a towering crane on the East Side began when a massivepiece of steel designed to secure it to a new high-rise building came loose and pancaked on top of a second support nine stories below, shearing it free and creating a fatal imbalance that sent the 22-story crane toppling across a two-block swath of Turtle Bay, officials said Sunday.", 
                "Officials were focusing their investigation in part on the way the steel piece -- called a \"collar\" -- was being installed, including whether a series of hoists and nylon straps used to hold it temporarily in place were strong enough to sustain its weight, said Patricia J. Lancaster, the buildings commissioner.", 
                "Building officials estimated the weight at 12,000 pounds.", 
                "Meanwhile, work crews and rescuers swarmed over the site of the disaster, on 51st Street and 50th Street just east of Second Avenue.", 
                "They began to remove portions of the broken crane's white lattice tower, one leaning against a 19-story building on 51st Street and another, which had broken off and tumbled through the air, lying across a demolishedfour-story town house on 50th Street.", 
                "Four construction workers -- a crane operator and three riggers who were helping to \"jump\" the crane, or increase its height -- were killed.", 
                "Three people were missing.", 
                "On Sunday, as hope dwindled, firefighters, including a unit that specializes in building collapses, continued to search for signs of life.", 
                "\"We're still calling it a search operation, though with each passing hour, things are getting more grim,\" said Nicholas Scoppetta, the fire commissioner.", 
                "Speaking at a news conference near the scene, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said 24 people were injured.", 
                "Buildings Department officials said construction on the building had been halted while the investigation continued.", 
                "\"As far as we can tell, all procedures that were called for were being followed, but it's much too early to make a definitive decision,\" Bloomberg said.", 
                "\"We will look to see whether or not there was human error or mechanical error or whether or not our procedures just aren't adequate.", 
                "At this point in time, we don't know, and we don't want to rush to any judgment.", 
                "\" On Saturday, hundreds of workers boiled about the site, and several other cranes were brought in to help lift heavy sections of latticed steel from the toppled crane.", 
                "Meanwhile, dozens of onlookers gazed from behind metal barricades on Second Avenue.", 
                "At the site of the demolished town house, which had a bar called Fubar in the ground floor and apartments above, ironworkers cut up sections of the toppled crane and removed pieces of the building.", 
                "Each time they cleared a section of the rubble, rescue workers descended on a ladder and then crawled farther into the collapsed ruins, armed with listening devices to search for signs of life.", 
                "Red Cross workers handed out coffee to rescue workers at the site while a Starbucks at the corner of 50th Street and Second Avenue gave out free coffee.", 
                "Seventeen buildings were evacuated, and most people were still not able to get inside.", 
                "One man, however, was given 10 minutes to dash into his apartment in the building at the corner of 50th Street and Second Avenue, which was damaged in the disaster, to retrieve his pet guinea pig.", 
                "The man, Seth Shearer, 24, said he persuaded officials to let him inside because he was scheduled to leave town on vacation and would not be able to get the animal until later.", 
                "Most people who had been displaced found lodging with relatives or made other arrangements.", 
                "Several streets in the area remained closed, and officials said they hoped to have at least one lane of Second Avenue opened by Monday morning.", 
                "The disaster occurred at 2:22 p.m. on Saturday, a day workers on the high-rise condominium under construction at 303 E. 51st St. had spent adding two or more 13-foot sections to increase the crane's height, a process known as \"jumping\" or \"climbing\" the crane.", 
                "By the time they were done, the crane's tower had reached a height of more than 200 feet, or about 20 stories.", 
                "That structure was topped by a cab and jib extending farther.", 
                "At that point, the workers turned to the process of bracing the crane by positioning a steel collar around the outside of the crane's tower at the building's 18th floor.", 
                "The collar, which officials said weighed about 12,000 pounds and was made of two U-shaped pieces of steel joined together, was to be secured to the tower and then tied by steel struts to the building.", 
                "As the work progressed, the collar was suspended high above the ground from metal hoists, known as chain blocks, connected to a higher section of the steel tower with slings made of thick nylon webbing, according to a person involved in the recovery.", 
                "But as workers were maneuvering the collar into place, it broke free and plummeted down the crane's tower, like a ring around a steel tube sliding down.", 
                "It slammed into another collar already in place at the ninth floor, shearing it from the struts that held it to the building and carrying it down to smash into yet another collar at the third floor.", 
                "Unmoored and unbalanced, the spindly structure teetered and fell, the heavy cab and counterweights at the top pulling it down onto the buildings to the south.", 
                "Lancaster said investigators were looking at how the collar was being maneuvered into place just before it fell and whether theslings might have broken.", 
                "She said investigators would try to determine whether the slings were worn or damaged or if they were strong enough to hold the collar's weight.", 
                "The person involved in the recovery provided a photograph of the collapsed collar showing one of the nylon straps still attached with what appeared to be a frayed and broken end.", 
                "Lancaster also said the position of the cab, with its approximately 40 tons of counterbalances, might have contributed to the disaster.", 
                "\"The counterweight was pointing south, and so it pulled the crane away from the building,\" she said.", 
                "\"If it had been pointing north, it would have pulled the crane into the building.", 
                "\" Scrutiny Sunday was also on the developer and the contractors involved in the work.", 
                "The crane was owned by New York Crane &amp;amp; Equipment Corp., but it had apparently been leased to one of the contractors involved in the project.", 
                "Lancaster said the company in charge of the crane was an Elizabeth, N.J., subcontractor on the construction project known as Joy Contractors Inc., identified as JCI in Building Department documents.", 
                "Lancaster said her agency was still determining what other construction jobs JCI was involved in.", 
                "The crane installation was designed and approved by Peter J. Stroh, an engineer based in West Babylon, N.Y., according to a permit issued for the equipment in January.", 
                "Stroh's company was helping Sunday with the removal of a crane piece that lay tilted against an apartment house on 51st Street, opposite the construction site, according to officials.", 
                "The lead developer on the project was James P. Kennelly, a retired firefighter with a law degree who branched out into real estate.", 
                "He has done about two dozen projects since he opened his own development company in the mid-1980s, but the building on East 51st, which is to rise to 43 stories, with 180 condominium apartments, was by far the largest.", 
                "The biggest building he had built before was a 14-story apartment building on East 30th Street in Manhattan.", 
                "Kennelly issued a statement Saturday saying he had instructed his construction manager, Reliance Construction Group, known as RCG, to cooperate with investigators.", 
                "\"We're devastated by this tragedy, and our prayers are with the families,\" he said in the statement.", 
                "Saturday's accident was the most recent of several high-profile construction accidents that have come during a building boom in the city.", 
                "The number of construction permits for new buildings or major renovations issued by the Buildings Department has soared 23.3 percent over the past five years, rising to 86,915 in 2007 from 70,515 in 2002.", 
                "There were 128 construction-related injuries last year, up from 116 in 2006, according to the Buildings Department.", 
                "The number of construction fatalities fell to 12 in 2007 from 18 in 2006.", 
                "There were at least five fatalities this year before the crane collapse Saturday.", 
                "James Conway, political director of Local 14 of the International Union of Operating Engineers, said that the collapse on East 51st Street was the \"worst crane accident\" in memory."
