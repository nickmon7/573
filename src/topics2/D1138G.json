                "Canada's former Secretary of State for the Asia Pacific region David Kilgour and human rights lawyer David Matas released a report Wednesday into such transplants after interviewing organ recipients in 30 countries.", 
                "They also interviewed Canadian hospital staff who subsequently cared for hundreds of patients after they underwent dubious transplant surgeries in China.", 
                "\"The involvement of the People's Liberation Army in these transplants is widespread,\" Kilgour told a press conference.", 
                "Like many civilian hospitals in rural China, military hospitals turned to selling organs to make up for government funding cuts in the 1980s, the report states.", 
                "But military personnel could operate with much more secrecy, it added.", 
                "\"Recipients often tell us that even when they receive transplants at civilian hospitals, those conducting the operation are military personnel,\" the report states.", 
                "It is the second report to be released by the pair, who in July published the results of a two-month investigation in which they implicated dozens of hospitals and jails throughout China in the transplant scandal.", 
                "Those allegations were vigorously denied by Chinese officials.", 
                "Hospitals in Canada's biggest cities, Vancouver, Calgary and Toronto meanwhile confirmed \"a substantial number\" of Canadians had traveled to China for suspicious organ transplants, Kilgour said.", 
                "\"We're in the three digits, up over 100 (from Canada each year) and the trend is accelerating,\" Matas said.", 
                "To curb what they called a \"disgusting form of evil,\" the pair publicly asked pharmaceutical firms to stop selling organ anti-rejection drugs to China.", 
                "They also urged countries to post travel advisories warning that organs from China may have been harvested from unwilling donors; asked states to cease offering follow-up care to patients who had shady organ transplants in China; and called on foreign doctors to cut ties with their Chinese counterparts suspected of such practices.", 
                "States should also enact legislation to ban their citizens from traveling to China for organ transplants from forced donors, although the study's authors admitted such prosecutions would be difficult to prove.", 
                "The US-based lobby group \"The Coalition to Investigate the Persecution of the Falungong in China\" had asked Kilgour and Matas to investigate claims by several of their members.", 
                "China banned the spiritual group in 1999 and has vehemently denied the allegations of organ harvesting, accusing the Falungong of spreading rumors in a bid to undermine the country's international relations and \"social stability.", 
                "\" Kilgour and Matas admitted that many of the claims were second-hand, but said there was enough evidence to \"paint a picture.",

                "Wang Xiaohua, a Falungong practitioner who now lives in Montreal, told reporters he \"suffered inhumane persecution\" at a Chinese labor camp where jailed Falungong practitioners, and not other prisoners, were systematically subjected to blood tests to match their organs with recipients.", 
                "In their previous report, Matas and Kilgour interviewed several Falungong members and the former wife of a surgeon who told her he had removed the corneas from some 2,000 anaesthetized Falungong prisoners in northeast China in the two years prior to October 2003.", 
                "They said they listened, with the help of certified interpreters, to more than 30 veiled calls made from Canada and the United States to Chinese officials who admitted to the surgeries.", 
                "Dozens more Chinese hospitals and jails were implicated in transcripts of new telephone calls, including one to an air force hospital in Chengdu City, in which an official said it would be \"no problem\" to get organs from young and healthy Falungong practitioners for a transplant."

                "Connor, now 11 months old and thriving, is one of several dozen babies around the world to have received mismatched hearts, part of a slowly growing movement to increase these tiniest patients' survival by taking advantage of a lag in their immune systems.", 
                "Now the U.S. transplant network is expanding that effort, saying youngsters may be candidates for an incompatible heart up to age 2.", 
                "It is the first step in a new push by the United Network for Organ Sharing to decrease the number of children who die awaiting an organ transplant, a toll particularly high for infants and toddlers.", 
                "\"It will not happen overnight,\" cautioned Dr. Stuart Sweet of Washington University in St. Louis, chairman of UNOS' pediatric transplant committee.", 
                "But the new heart guidelines \"have the potential for significantly impacting the number of patients who die on the waiting list.", 
                "\" If the policy sounds counterintuitive, well, it is: Implant a mismatched heart in an adult, and he or she will die rapidly.", 
                "That happened in 2003, when surgeons in North Carolina accidentally gave a teenager the wrong-type heart and lungs.", 
                "But babies' immune systems must learn to recognize and attack an organ of a different blood type, a process that is turning out to be more gradual than scientists long thought.", 
                "Transplant a heart before the baby starts making antibodies that will attack a mismatched organ, and he or she survives as well as babies given matching hearts, says Dr. Lori West, the Canadian surgeon who pioneered incompatible transplants in Toronto in the late 1990s.", 
                "Those babies still need immune-suppressing drugs for life -- blood type is just one form of organ rejection.", 
                "But given the scarcity of tiny hearts, the mismatch option was good news.", 
                "In 2005, the last count available, 45 children under age 2 died while awaiting a new heart.", 
                "As of last month, 74 youngsters under 2 were on the waiting list.", 
                "About one in 5,000 children are born with a heart defect so bad that they'll need a transplant in the first year or two of life.", 
                "Yet few babies die of conditions that allow their hearts to be donated.", 
                "Still, until recently, U.S. transplant centers were reluctant to try mismatched hearts.", 
                "UNOS began allowing them as a last resort for infants, under age 1, in 2002; only 19 were performed through 2005.", 
                "The concern: whether children really fare well years after getting a mismatched heart, or if rejection just sets in later.", 
                "But in the last year -- with some of West's initial patients now surviving a decade -- that worry is fading.", 
                "Now the question is who is a good candidate for a mismatched heart, says Dr. Steve Webber, cardiology chief at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh.",

                "\"Nobody knows for sure.", 
                "\" Babies begin producing antibodies to different blood types between 5 months and 2 1/2 years of age -- it varies widely from child to child, says West, now at the University of Alberta's Stollery Children's Hospital.", 
                "Only a few of the 90 or so mismatched heart transplants performed worldwide have occurred past a child's first birthday, the oldest in a 30-month-old in Britain.",

                "It expands use of mismatched hearts up to age 2, as long as antibody tests show the toddlers are candidates.", 
                "For now, many transplant centers are like Webber's, trying their first mismatched transplants in babies before working up to toddlers.", 
                "Last March, Connor Geddes became Pittsburgh's first of five such transplants.", 
                "His heart's left side was too small to pump.", 
                "Doctors said Connor would not live long enough to await a heart that matched his Type A blood, but they had a heart from a Type B donor available.", 
                "\"It still amazes me,\" says Carrie Geddes.", 
                "\"When we talk to people, friends, and tell them, nobody really realizes that can happen.",

                "One problem is that when grieving parents consent to a donation, organs aren't always recovered, perhaps because the local transplant center did not immediately see a good recipient, Sweet says.",

                "\"There are organs out there that if we find the right recipient, they could be transplanted.",

                "The University of California, San Francisco has taken over a post-transplant clinic for kidney patients at Kaiser Permanente's San Francisco hospital, bringing to an end Kaiser's brief -- and scandal-plagued -- foray into the organ transplant business.", 
                "The takeover means that UC doctors now will care for Kaiser's kidney transplant patients before, during and after their surgeries.", 
                "Kaiser had been caring for about 1,500 patients who had already received transplants.", 
                "``This is the last piece of the puzzle,'' said Dr. Stephen Tomlanovich, medical director of UC San Francisco's renal transplant program.", 
                "``It's been a long journey.", 
                "'' The giant HMO announced in May that it was closing its fledgling kidney transplant program after the Los Angeles Times reported that hundreds of patients had been endangered during its start-up in late 2004.", 
                "Kaiser had forced patients to leave established programs at two outside hospitals and join its own waiting list.", 
                "In the process, Kaiser lost track of many patients and delayed critical surgeries.", 
                "Since May, nearly 2,000 Kaiser patients awaiting transplants have been transferred to kidney programs at UC hospitals in San Francisco and Davis.", 
                "Fewer than 40 remain to be shifted.", 
                "Tomlanovich's team will take over from Kaiser's transplant medical director, Dr. Sharon Inokuchi.", 
                "Inokuchi, who has been faulted by federal regulators for her role in Kaiser's troubles, will become a non-transplant nephrologist with Kaiser's affiliated Permanente medical group once the last patient is transferred and the program officially closes.", 
                "Dr. Phil Madvig, associate executive director of the Permanente group, said the closure of the transplant program and the subsequent transfer of patients are a ``very significant undertaking'' that the HMO is pleased to have nearly completed.", 
                "``That is a good feeling .", 
                "that we have accomplished this and put this behind us,'' Madvig said.", 
                "In the nine months since the program announced its closure and began transferring patients, the pace of transplants has picked up considerably.", 
                "Nearly 120 Kaiser patients have received new kidneys, more than in the prior 20 months.", 
                "Some patients received transplants within weeks of transferring.", 
                "But the fallout from Kaiser's missteps continues.", 
                "Last month, the president of Kaiser's Northern California region, Mary Ann Thode, said she would retire by early 2008.", 
                "She was the HMO's public face after the scandal broke and alternately apologized and defended the program's quality.", 
                "In addition, Kaiser settled a whistle-blower lawsuit filed by former kidney transplant administrator David Merlin, who was fired in early 2006 after eight weeks on the job.", 
                "Merlin contended that Kaiser retaliated against him for raising concerns about the way the kidney program was operating.", 
                "In June, the administrator of Kaiser's San Francisco hospital, Mike Alexander, stepped down.", 
                "Two months later, Kaiser agreed to pay a $2-million fine to state HMO regulators and make a $3-million donation for organ donor outreach.", 
                "And in December, the national regulatory group overseeing transplantation stripped Kaiser of its good standing despite pleas from the HMO's representatives not to do so.", 
                "The state Department of Managed Health Care continues to investigate Kaiser for the way it handled patient complaints, including those from kidney patients who said they were ignored.", 
                "The results of that inquiry are expected next month."

                "Police are investigating whether a Kaiser Permanente transplant surgeon attempted to hasten the death last February of a 25-year-old San Luis Obispo, Calif., man on life support in order to harvest his organs more quickly.", 
                "The allegations, if true, would constitute a grave breach of the nation's organ transplant rules, as well as a public relations setback for those promoting organ donation, experts in transplantation said.", 
                "San Luis Obispo police and the Medical Board of California are looking into the conduct of Dr. Hootan Roozrokh, who was a surgeon at Kaiser's now-defunct kidney transplant program in San Francisco.", 
                "At issue is whether Roozrokh ordered excessive doses of powerful pain medication to speed up the death of Ruben Navarro, according to several sources familiar with the case who spoke on condition of anonymity because investigations are ongoing.", 
                "Roozrokh did not return messages left at his work and cell phones.", 
                "Medical board spokeswoman Candis Cohen said her agency also is investigating the conduct of a second physician present during the incident.", 
                "Sources identified the other doctor as Dr. Arturo Martinez, who at the time was the surgical director of Kaiser's transplant program, sources said.", 
                "Martinez could not be reached for comment late Tuesday.", 
                "Neither surgeon was recovering the organs on behalf of Kaiser; rather, they were working on behalf of the local group that procures and distributes organs in the region.", 
                "Dr. Timothy Pruett, president-elect of United Network for Organ Sharing, called the allegations ``horrific.", 
                "'' He worried that they could scare people away from donating organs to help the 95,000 people awaiting life-saving transplants nationwide.", 
                "United Network for Organ Sharing is the federal contractor charged with ensuring the safety and equity of the nation's transplant system.", 
                "``We have to guarantee to the public that we're not going to go out and kill people to get their organs,'' said Pruett, chief of transplant surgery at the University of Virginia.", 
                "``That's the worst of those cheap sci-fi books: The ghoulish docs are out pulling the plugs on these poor defenseless people, trying to snatch their organs.", 
                "'' According to San Luis Obispo police, Navarro was on life support and near death after he was found unresponsive at Casa de Vida nursing home.", 
                "He was taken to Sierra Vista Regional Medical Center in San Luis Obispo and placed on life support.", 
                "When it became clear he would not live, his family agreed to allow his organs to be harvested, and transplant surgeons were summoned on Feb. 3, 2006.", 
                "State law specifies that transplant physicians or surgeons are not allowed to be involved in the treatment of potential organ donors before they are declared dead.", 
                "This restriction is designed, in large part, to assuage concerns that the retrieval of organs could take priority over patient care.", 
                "In this case, however, Roozrokh entered the operating room at Sierra Vista and was directing the administration of drugs to Navarro and the removal of life support, the two sources said.", 
                "``Let's just give him some more candy,'' Roozrokh told nurses in the operating room, according to a person who was briefed on what took place.", 
                "When Navarro did not die within 30 minutes -- the time period set out to ensure the viability of the organs -- he was returned to the intensive care unit, according to standard transplant procedures.", 
                "He died the following morning and, by that time, his organs were no longer viable for transplantation, police said in a statement.", 
                "Within days, nurses at the hospital -- alarmed about what had taken place -- alerted their superiors, Sierra Vista spokesman Ron Yukelson said.", 
                "An investigation immediately was launched, and regulators and the coroner were notified.", 
                "Yukelson said outside transplant surgeons are not credentialed to operate on patients at the 165-bed hospital, and must wait until a patient isdeclared dead by hospital staff to begin organ procurement.", 
                "In this case, ``the transplant surgeon began to direct care in the operating room,'' Yukelson said.", 
                "``This physician clearly violated our policy.", 
                "'' As a result of the hospital's inquiry, an operating room nurse has been reassigned to administrative duties pending the outcome of the investigation.", 
                "The hospital also reviewed its policies and did extensive training, he said.", 
                "Subsequent organ donations now require the oversight of the hospital administrator on call."
