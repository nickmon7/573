                "In a news release sent out on Monday from the 5th Fleet's Middle East headquarters in Bahrain, the Navy said the large crude tanker Sirius Star was attacked more than 450 nautical miles southeast of Mombasa, Kenya.", 
                "A British Foreign Office spokesman said there were at least two British nationals aboard the MV Sirius Star, but said he could offer no further details on the ship or what had happened to it.", 
                "The Sirius Star was built in South Korea's Daewoo shipping yards and commissioned in March.", 
                "Classed as a Very Large Crude Carrier, the ship is 318,000 dead weight tons.", 
                "An operator with Aramco said there was no one available at the company to comment after business hours.",

                "Somali pirates have hijacked a Saudi-owned oil supertanker loaded with crude and carrying 25 crew members off the Kenyan coast, the U.S. Navy said Monday.", 
                "It was the largest ship pirates have seized, and the farthest out to sea they have successfully struck.", 
                "The hijacking was alarming because it highlighted the vulnerability of even very large ships and pointed to widening ambitions and capabilities among ransom-hungry pirates who have carried out a surge of attacks this year off Somalia.", 
                "Saturday's hijacking of the MV Sirius Star tanker occurred in the Indian Ocean far south of the zone patrolled by international warships in the busy Gulf of Aden shipping channel, which leads to and from the Suez Canal.", 
                "Maritime security experts said they have tracked a troubling spread in pirate activity southward into a vast area of ocean that would be extremely difficult and costly to patrol, and this hijacking fits that pattern.", 
                "\"It is very alarming,\" said Cyrus Mody, manager of the International Maritime Bureau.", 
                "\"It had been slightly more easy to get it under control in the Gulf of Aden because it is a comparatively smaller area of water which has to be patrolled, but this is huge.", 
                "\" The tanker, which is owned by Saudi oil company Aramco, is one of the largest ships to sail the seas.", 
                "It is 330 meters (1,080 feet) long, or about the length of an aircraft carrier, and can carry about 2 million barrels of oil.", 
                "Lt. Nathan Christensen, a spokesman for the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet, said the Sirius Star was carrying crude at the time of the hijacking, but he did know how much.", 
                "He also had no details about where the ship was sailing from and where it was headed at the time of the attack.", 
                "He said the bandits were taking it to an anchorage off the Somali port of Eyl.", 
                "The port on Somalia's northeastern coast has become a pirate haven and a number of ships are already being held there as pirates try to force ransoms.", 
                "The ship was sailing under a Liberian flag and its 25-member crew includes citizens of Croatia, Britain, the Philippines, Poland and Saudi Arabia.", 
                "A British Foreign Office spokesman said there were at least two British nationals aboard the vessel.", 
                "The Sirius Star was attacked more than 450 nautical miles southeast of Mombasa, Kenya, the U.S. 5th Fleet said in a statement from its Middle East headquarters in Bahrain.", 
                "\"It's the largest ship we've seen hijacked and one attacked farthest out on the sea,\" Christensen said.", 
                "The capturing of the oil tanker represents a \"fundamental shift in the ability of pirates to be able to attack merchant vessels,\" he said.", 
                "The Sirius Star was built in South Korea's Daewoo shipping yards and commissioned in March.", 
                "Classed as a Very Large Crude Carrier, the ship is 318,000 dead weight tons.", 
                "If it were fully loaded, the ship's deck would be lower to the water, making it easier for pirates to climb aboard with grappling equipment and ladders, as they do in most hijackings.", 
                "It is not clear if there was a security team on board the vessel.", 
                "An operator with Aramco said there was no one available at the company to comment after business hours.", 
                "Calls went unanswered at Vela international, the Dubai-based marine company that operated the ship for Aramco.", 
                "Somali pirates are trained fighters, often dressed in military fatigues, using speedboats equipped with satellite phones and GPS equipment.", 
                "They are typically armed with automatic weapons, anti-tank rockets launchers and various types of grenades.", 
                "As pirates have become better armed and equipped, they have sailed farther out to sea in search of bigger targets, including oil tankers, among the 20,000 tankers, freighters and merchant vessels transiting the Gulf of Aden each year.", 
                "Attacks have increased more than 75 percent this year.", 
                "With most attacks ending with million-dollar payouts, piracy is considered the biggest economy in Somalia.", 
                "Pirates rarely hurt their hostages, instead holding out for a huge payday.", 
                "The strategy works well: A report last month by a London-based think tank said pirates have raked in up to $30 million in ransoms this year alone.", 
                "In Somalia, pirates are better-funded, better-organized and better-armed than one might imagine in a country that has been in tatters for nearly two decades.", 
                "They do occasionally get nabbed, however.", 
                "Earlier this year, French commandos used night vision goggles and helicopters in operations that killed or captured several pirates, who are now standing trial in Paris.", 
                "The stepped-up international presence recently also appears to have deterred several attacks.", 
                "Raja Kiwan, a Dubai-based analyst with PFC Energy, said the hijacking raises \"some serious questions\" about what is needed to secure such ships when they are on the open seas.", 
                "\"It's not easy to take over a ship\" as massive as an oil tanker, particularly VLCC's that can transport about 2 million barrels of crude, he said.", 
                "He said such vessels typically have an armed security contingent on board but could not say if that was the case with the Sirius Star.", 
                "Pirates have gone after oil tankers before.", 
                "In October, a Spanish military patrol plane thwarted pirates trying to hijack an oil tanker by buzzing them three times and dropping smoke canisters.", 
                "On April 21, pirates fired rocket-propelled grenades at a Japanese oil tanker, leaving a hole that allowed several hundred gallons of fuel to leak out, raising fears for the environment.", 
                "In September, three pirates in a speed boat fired machine guns at an Iranian crude oil carrier, though the ship escaped after a 30-minute chase.", 
                "Warships from the more than a dozen nations as well as NATO forces have focused their anti-piracy patrols in the Gulf of Aden, increasing their military presence in recent months.", 
                "But Saturday's hijacking occurred much farther south, highlighting weaknesses in the international response to the problem.", 
                "\"The coalition has suppressed a number of attacks ... but there will never be enough warships,\" said Graeme Gibbon Brooks, the managing director of British company Dryad Maritime Intelligence Service Ltd. \"The whole area is 2.5 million square miles (6.5 million square kilometers) ... the coalition have to act preemptively and be one step ahead of the pirates.", 
                "The difficulty here is that the ship was beyond the area where the coalition were currently acting.", 
                "\" ------ Associated Press writers Katharine Houreld and Elizabeth A. Kennedy in Nairobi, Kenya, and Jason Keyser and Tarek el-Tablawy in Cairo, Egypt, contributed to this report."

                "Somali pirates hijacked a giant Saudi supertanker with a cargo of crude oil hundreds of miles out in the Indian Ocean in a dramatic escalation that showed their expanding reach, puncturing a security web of warships trying to protect vital shipping lanes.", 
                "It was the largest vessel seized yet in a surge of pirate attacks, and the farthest out to sea that the well-armed fighters, bolstered by millions in past ransoms, have successfully struck.", 
                "Maritime experts warned that the broad daylight attack, reported by the U.S. Navy on Monday, was an alarming sign of the difficulty of patrolling a vast stretch of ocean key for oil and other cargo traffic.", 
                "The brand new MV Sirius Star tanker, with a 25-member crew, was seized at about 10 a.m. Saturday more than 450 nautical miles southeast of Mombasa, Kenya, the U.S. Navy said.", 
                "The area lies far south of the zone where warships have increased their patrols this year in the Gulf of Aden, one of the busiest channels in the world, leading to and from the Suez Canal, and the scene of most past attacks.", 
                "The massive supertanker would seem to present a daunting target for the pirates, who usually operate in small speedboats.", 
                "At 330 meters (1,080 feet), it's the length of an aircraft carrier, able to carry about 2 million barrels of oil.", 
                "But its crew may have had a false sense of security so far from shore, and pirates have repeatedly demonstrated their skill in taking down big prizes.", 
                "Details of Saturday's attack were not known, but in past seizures, pirates have used ropes and ladders to climb the hull -- and often on large ships, the crew don't notice them until it's too late.", 
                "On the Sirius Star, the attackers likely would have had to scale about 10 meters (33 feet) from the water to the deck.", 
                "It was not clear if the Sirius Star had any armed security on board.", 
                "In past attacks, alert crews have been able to fend off pirates trying to climb the sides, using water hoses to knock them away.", 
                "But the pirates are able to strike back: In April, they punched a hole in the side of a Japanese oil tanker with a rocket-propelled grenade in an unsuccessful attempt to capture it.", 
                "Pirates have been spreading their attacks in recent weeks southward into a vast area of the Indian Ocean that would be extremely difficult and costly to patrol, maritime security experts said.", 
                "\"It had been slightly more easy to get it under control in the Gulf of Aden because it is a comparatively smaller area of water which has to be patrolled, but this is huge,\" said Cyrus Mody, manager of the International Maritime Bureau.", 
                "The pirates were taking the captured tanker and crew to an anchorage off the Somali port of Eyl, Lt. Nathan Christensen, a spokesman for the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet, said.", 
                "The port on Somalia's northeastern coast has become a pirate haven and a number of ships are already being held there as pirates negotiate ransoms.", 
                "Christensen said the Sirius Star was carrying crude, but could not say how much.", 
                "Fully loaded, the ship's cargo could be worth about $100 million.", 
                "But the pirates would have no way of selling crude and no way to refine it in Somalia.", 
                "Instead, they were likely to demand a ransom, as they have in the past.", 
                "\"It's the largest ship we've seen hijacked and one attacked farthest out on the sea,\" Christensen said.", 
                "The capturing of the oil tanker represents a \"fundamental shift in the ability of pirates to be able to attack merchant vessels.", 
                "\" The Sirius Star, which was commissioned in March and is owned by Saudi oil company Aramco, is classed as a Very Large Crude Carrier, the second largest classification.", 
                "It was sailing under a Liberian flag and its 25-member crew includes citizens of Croatia, Britain, the Philippines, Poland and Saudi Arabia.", 
                "A British Foreign Office spokesman said there were at least two British nationals on board.", 
                "An operator with Aramco said there was no one available at the company to comment after business hours.", 
                "Calls went unanswered at Vela international, the Dubai-based marine company that operated the ship for Aramco.", 
                "Christensen said he had no details on the ship's port of origin and destination.", 
                "Pirate attacks off Somalia have surged more than 75 percent this year, hitting freighters, tankers, yachts and fishing vessels.", 
                "The pirates raised international alarm bells in September when they seized a Ukrainian freighter, the Faina, carrying a cargo of battle tanks and other weapons.", 
                "The Faina and its 20-member crew are still being held off Somalia, watched by warships to prevent the removal of its cargo.", 
                "With most attacks ending with million-dollar payouts, piracy is considered the biggest economy in Somalia, a country that has had no stable government for decades.", 
                "A report last month by a London-based think tank said pirates have raked in up to $30 million in ransoms this year alone.", 
                "The pirates are trained fighters, often dressed in military fatigues, using speedboats equipped with satellite phones and GPS equipment.", 
                "They are typically armed with automatic weapons, anti-tank rockets launchers and various types of grenades.", 
                "Far out to sea, their speedboats operate from larger motherships.", 
                "\"Pirates are becoming very strong and very rich, and they are expanding into other parts of the (Indian) ocean beyond the Gulf of Aden,\" said Nour Mohammed Saeed, a former fisheries minister in the Puntland region of northern Somalia.", 
                "\"They are getting a lot of money and they know that they can make more.", 
                "\" The seizure of the Faina and its cargo of weapons prompted a reinforcement of warships patrolling the waters off Somalia.", 
                "Along with a Russian frigate and Indian vessels, a NATO flotilla of seven ships is in the Gulf of Aden to help the U.S. 5th Fleet in anti-piracy patrols and to escort cargo vessels.", 
                "The 5th Fleet said it has repelled about two dozen pirate attacks since Aug. 22 in the gulf.", 
                "Another multinational fleet currently led by the Dutch has carved out a protected lane through the Gulf of Aden, through which 20,000 tankers, freighters and merchant vessels transit every year, entering and exiting the Suez Canal.", 
                "But other ships -- including ones too big for the canal like the Sirius Star -- pass off East Africa to circle the continent by the Cape of Good Hope.", 
                "The expansion of attacks signals they too could be vulnerable.", 
                "\"There will never be enough warships,\" said Graeme Gibbon Brooks, the managing director of British company Dryad Maritime Intelligence Service Ltd. \"The whole area is 2.5 million square miles (6.5 million square kilometers) ... the coalition have to act preemptively and be one step ahead of the pirates.",

                "Andrew Mwangura, the East African Coordinator of the Seafarers Assistance Program, said the oil tanker is the largest ship pirates have hijacked along the east Africa coast.", 
                "\"It seems the vessel was hijacked on Saturday because the ship is approaching anchorage off the port of Eyl in Somalia.", 
                "For it to reach there, it must have taken three to four days,\" Mwangura told Xinhua by telephone.", 
                "Reports from the U.S. Navy said the tanker, Sirius Star, operated by Vela International, was hijacked after a group of pirates managed to scale the 10-meter high side of the ship.", 
                "Lieutenant Nate Christensen, a spokesman for the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet said the hijacking was shocking because it highlighted the vulnerability of even very large ships and pointed to widening ambitions and capabilities among ransom- hungry pirates who have carried out a surge of attacks this year off Somalia.", 
                "The U.S. Navy said the Saturday's hijacking of the oil tanker occurred in the Indian Ocean far south of the zone patrolled by international warships in the busy Gulf of Aden shipping channel, which leads to and from the Suez Canal."

                "The owner, Vela International, a subsidiary of the Saudi Arabia-based oil giant Saudi Aramco, said in a statement that the company was awaiting further contact from the pirates who seized the vessel about 480 miles off the coast of Somalia.", 
                "Earlier reports had said that the 1,080-foot-long ship, Sirius Star, had been hijacked off the Kenyan coast.",

                "The supertanker, about the same length as an American Nimitz class aircraft carrier, is the largest ship known to have been seized by pirates, and it was fully loaded with 2 million barrels of oil.",

                "The hijacking follows a string of increasingly brazen attacks by Somali pirates in recent months, but this appeared to be first time they have seized an oil tanker.", 
                "While most of the hijackings have taken place in the Gulf of Aden, which separates Somalia from Yemen, the Saudi tanker was seized hundreds of miles to the south in a vast stretch of open ocean as the tanker headed toward the Cape of Good Hope.",

                "\"The EU presence will be bigger and more designed for the mission,\" Appathurai said, but he added that the military alliance is wondering \"would anything complementary be necessary\" for the EU.", 
                "He added that NATO played no role in response to the seizure of the oil-laden Saudi tanker, the Sirius Star, which was taken at the weekend in waters off the coast of Kenya and Tanzania.",

                "Experts say the attack shows few ships are safe sailing the Indian Ocean.", 
                "Appathurai noted that NATO had escorted around 7,000 tonnes of humanitarian aid to Somalia since its operation began this month, and cited the UN World Food Programme as saying that no pirate attacks had hit its ships since.", 
                "The WFP ships 30,000 to 35,000 tonnes of aid into Somalia each month.", 
                "Pirates are well organised in the area where Somalia's northeastern tip juts into the Indian Ocean, preying on a key maritime route leading to the Suez Canal through which an estimated 30 percent of the world's oil transits.", 
                "They operate high-powered speedboats and are heavily armed, sometimes holding ships for weeks until they are released for large ransoms paid by governments or owners.",

                "Dubai-based Vela International Marine Ltd., a subsidiary of Saudi oil company Aramco, said in a statement Monday that company response teams have been set up and are working to ensure the release of the crew and the vessel.", 
                "The U.S. Navy said the MV Sirius Star was seized far off the coast of Kenya on Saturday and that the bandits were taking the ship to a Somali port known as a hub of pirate activity.", 
                "However, the statement posted on Vela's Web site late Monday said the ship was hijacked Sunday.", 
                "The discrepancy could not immediately be explained.", 
                "Attacks by Somali pirates have surged this year as bandits have become bolder, better armed and capable of operating hundreds of miles from shore.", 
                "A coalition of warships from eight nations, as well as from NATO and the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet, is patrolling a critical zone in the Gulf of Aden leading to and from the Suez Canal.", 
                "That's where most of the more than 80 attacks this year have occurred.", 
                "The Saudi tanker, however, was seized far to the south of the patrolled zone, about 450 nautical miles (833 kilometers) southeast of Mombasa, Kenya, according the U.S. Navy.", 
                "Maritime security experts said they have tracked a southward spread in piracy over the last several weeks into a vast area of the Indian Ocean, noting with alarm that the area would be almost impossible to patrol.", 
                "The U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet said Tuesday it was monitoring the situation but didn't expect to send warships to surround the vessel as it has done with a Ukrainian ship loaded with tanks and other weaponry the was seized off the Somali coast on Sept. 25 and remains in pirate hands.", 
                "\"I don't anticipate any U.S. ships on station,\" said Lt. Nathan Christensen, a spokesman for the 5th Fleet, speaking from its headquarters in Bahrain.", 
                "He would not elaborate on how the Navy was watching the hijacked tanker.", 
                "\"We remain deeply concerned because this attack represents a fundamental change in pirates' ability to hijack bigger vessels farther out at sea,\" Christensen said.", 
                "The Sirius Star is the largest ship ever taken by Somali pirates, though large chemical tankers and freighters have also been hijacked.", 
                "It is \"the largest pirated vessel in the region\" to date, Christensen said.", 
                "At 1,080 feet (329 meters), it is the length of an aircraft carrier and can carry about 2 million barrels of oil.", 
                "\"We are very concerned that a (ship) of this size has been hijacked.", 
                "We have safety concerns, security concerns, environmental concerns,\" said Noel Choong, the head of the International Maritime Bureau's regional piracy center in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",

                "Including the Sirius Star, Vela owns and operates a fleet of 19 vessels classed as Very Large Crude Oil Carriers.", 
                "It uses the ships to transport supplies primarily between the Middle East, Europe and the U.S. Gulf Coast, according to the company's Web site.",
