                "Continuous rise of water in almost all the rivers in Bangladesh's northern, northeastern and middle parts claimed eight people's lives on Sunday and left nearly a million marooned, causing immense sufferings to them and damage to crops.", 
                "At least eight people died in floodwater or in flood-related incidents like snakebite in three northern districts of Kurigram, Mymensingh and Netrakona on Sunday, local daily The Daily Star reported.", 
                "Almost 1 million people were marooned by floodwater in about 10 districts in northern, northeastern and central parts of the country, as floodwater triggered by incessant monsoon rains have destroyed houses, submerged paddy fields and disrupted road transport in many places.", 
                "More and more people are taking shelters at the higher places, mostly embankments, where scarcity of food and drinking water is becoming acute by the day, while water-borne diseases like diarrhea, cholera and skin diseases have become almost a regular phenomenon.", 
                "This situation is most likely to deteriorate as the Bangladesh Flood Forecasting and Warning Center (FFWC) reported on Sunday that water flow in the major rivers, which are already flowing above danger levels, may rise further in the next few days.", 
                "Flood situation therefore will deteriorate in about fifteen districts in northern, northeastern and central parts of the country.", 
                "Low-lying areas in the eastern part of the capital Dhaka, which is already facing waterlogging, are likely to be inundated in the next one or two days, as small rivers surrounding Dhaka are about to approach danger levels.", 
                "Bangladesh Chief Adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed Saturday asked the concerned authority to immediately create a Flood Coordination and Monitoring Cell at the CA's office to monitor the activities of all flood-controlling cells to take prompt action in tackling any exigencies of floods in the country."
