                "The bombs were within a radius of 50 feet, the police said, and may have been planted in the wheels of bicycles, the mangled remains of which were found near many of the blast sites.", 
                "There were no claims of responsibility, which is typical of terrorist attacks in India.", 
                "But the junior minister for home affairs, Sriprakash Jaiswal, immediately said \"foreign terrorists\" were suspected, a phrase understood to refer to India's neighbor and nuclear rival, Pakistan.",

                "Six more were in quick succession in the warrens of shops and monuments nearby, including the popular 18th-century tourist site called Hawa Mahal, and the Johri Bazaar, lined with jewelers.",

                "Rohit Singh, the spokesman for Rajasthan state, of which Jaipur is the capital, estimated the death toll to be over 50 about three hours after the explosions.", 
                "On Wednesday morning, the superintendent of the main government hospital also said the toll was over 50.", 
                "The Indian federal government dispatched explosives experts from the National Security Group, and put several major cities on alert, including New Delhi.", 
                "Although Jaipur, known as the pink city, is a popular tourist destination, mid-May, the peak of the Indian summer, is not a busy season, and there were no reports that any foreigners had been killed.", 
                "The last major bombing in India was in August, when a pair of bombs went off in an outdoor auditorium and restaurant in the southern city of Hyderabad, killing more than 40.", 
                "Two years ago, serial blasts along the commuter train line in Mumbai, India's commercial capital, killed nearly 200.", 
                "Singh, the state spokesman, said that it was too early to say who was responsible, but that the attack, on a summer's evening when the walled city was thronged, appeared to be intended to ignite religious fury between Hindus and Muslims.", 
                "Similar terrorist attacks aimed at religious sites in recent years have not succeeded in setting off sectarian violence.", 
                "The Hindu holy city of Varanasi was struck by a pair of bombings in March 2006, killing 14, and a blast killed two worshipers in one of the holiest Muslim shrines in Ajmer, also in Rajasthan, last September."

                "Seven bombs ripped through a centuries-old Indian city Tuesday, leaving at least 60 people dead in a jewelry market, on the steps of a Hindu monkey god temple and in other ordinarily packed areas of the popular tourist destination.", 
                "The blasts all struck within the old walls of Jaipur, a city in western India that's known for its pink-hued palaces, and suspicion quickly fell on Islamic militant groups blamed for a string of attacks on India in recent years.", 
                "\"Obviously, it's a terrorist plot,\" said A.S. Gill, the police chief of Rajasthan, the state where Jaipur is located.", 
                "\"The way it has been done, the attempt was to cause the maximum damage to human life,\" he said, adding an eighth bomb was found and defused by police.", 
                "Another senior Rajasthan police officer, A.K.", 
                "Jain, said 60 people were killed and 150 wounded in the bombings.", 
                "No one claimed responsibility for the attack, as is the case with most bombings in India.", 
                "But within hours of the blasts, authorities were suggesting that blame would eventually fall on Pakistan and the Islamic militant groups New Delhi accuses it of backing.", 
                "\"One can't rule out the involvement of a foreign power,\" said India's junior home minister, Sriprakash Jaiswal, using language commonly understood to refer to neighboring Pakistan.", 
                "Jaiswal refused to say if he was indeed talking about Pakistan -- \"that's the subject of investigation,\" was all he would say.", 
                "But Indian authorities have blamed Pakistan-based Islamic militant groups for a spate of bombings that have killed nearly 400 people in this predominantly Hindu country of 1.1 billion people since 2005.", 
                "Pakistan, an overwhelmingly Muslim country, denies any role in the bombings.", 
                "The attacks have run the gamut from the July 2006 train bombings that left nearly 200 people dead in Mumbai, India's financial center, to small blasts like the one that struck a Muslim shrine in Rajasthan last year, killing two people.", 
                "Jaiswal suggested Tuesday's bombings were connected to those previous explosions, saying \"the blasts are part of a big conspiracy.", 
                "\" Each new bombing has brought fears of a fresh outbreak of the violence between Hindus and Muslims that has sporadically bled India throughout its history, and authorities appealed for calm in the wake of Tuesday's attack.", 
                "Shortly after the bombings, authorities put New Delhi, India's capital, and Mumbai, the country's financial center, on high alert along with several other cities.", 
                "Security was also quickly stepped up at airports and railway stations across the country.", 
                "The blasts began around 7:30 p.m. (1400 GMT), and one hit a market near a temple dedicated to the Hindu monkey god Hanuman.", 
                "Tuesday is the day of worship set aside for Hanuman, and the temple was packed with people offering prayers on the way home from work.", 
                "Another blast took place near the Johari Bazaar -- the city's jewelry market, a popular destination for tourists.", 
                "The tourist season, however, ended in March and there were no immediate indications that foreigners had been caught in the explosions.", 
                "Parikshit Bhandari, who saw the attack near the jewelry market, said there was \"blood all around and wounded people crawling on the ground.", 
                "\" Television channels showed footage of mangled bicycles, damaged cars and overturned bicycle rickshaws, the most popular mode of transport in the crowded lanes of Jaipur.", 
                "The city is one of the major attractions in Rajasthan, a desert region dotted with palaces and temples that draw hundreds of thousands of Indian and foreign tourists every year, from bargain-hunting backpackers to celebrities like Mick Jagger.", 
                "While no foreigners appeared to have been caught in Tuesday's attack, \"We are all nervous.", 
                "We don't want Jaipur's economy to go down,\" said Manoj Sharma, a New Delhi travel agent.", 
                "Still, it'll be months before temperatures in Rajasthan dip below 100 degrees and the high season for tourists begins.", 
                "By then, he hopes, fears will have faded.",
