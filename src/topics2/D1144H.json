                "Lead, if ingested by children, can cause long-term neurological problems that affect learning and behavior.", 
                "\"Parents should not delay in getting these toys away from their kids,\" Scott Wolfson, spokesman for the Consumer Product Safety Commission, said Thursday.", 
                "An alert posted at a Web site devoted to the toy line, www.totallythomas.com, included a list of more than two dozen items affected by the recall.", 
                "The company noted that toys that bear a code containing a \"WJ\" or \"AZ\" on the bottom of the toy or the inside of the battery door are not included in the recall.", 
                "The company at first urged consumers to mail in their Thomas toys, at their expense, in exchange for a replacement and a free train, an offer that angered some consumers.", 
                "Many Thomas the Tank Engine fans have collected dozens of trains, boxcars or railroad stations, and shipping several heavy pieces could quickly become expensive.", 
                "Later on Thursday, the company, which is based in Oak Brook, Ill., agreed to handle the shipping cost for all consumers who request it.", 
                "The affected Thomas toys were manufactured in China, which has come under fire recently for exporting a variety of goods, from pet food to toothpaste, that may pose safety or health hazards.", 
                "\"These are not cheap, plastic McDonald's toys,\" said Marian Goldstein of Maplewood, N.J., who spent more than $1,000 on her son's Thomas collection, for toys that can cost $10 to $70 apiece.", 
                "\"But these are what is supposed to be a high-quality children's toy.", 
                "\" Goldstein's 4-year-old son owns more than 40 pieces from the Thomas series, and seven of them were on the recall list, including the Sodor deluxe fire station, a footlong piece that is a little heavier than the average train.", 
                "Goldstein said she wondered who would pay for testing her son for lead poisoning if her insurance did not cover it."

                "Every one of the 24 toys recalled for safety reasons in the United States so far this year, including the enormously popular Thomas and Friends wooden train sets, was manufactured in China, a record that is increasingly causing alarm among consumer advocates, parents and regulators.", 
                "The latest recall, announced last week, involves 1.5 million Thomas and Friends trains and rail sets -- or about 4 percent of all those sold in the United States over the last two years -- which were coated at a factory in China with potentially poisonous lead paint.", 
                "But just in the last month, a so-called Floating Eyeballs toy made in China was recalled after it was found to be filled with kerosene, sets of toy drums and a toy bear were also recalled because of lead paint and an infant wrist rattle was recalled because of a choking hazard.", 
                "Combined with the recent scares related to Chinese-made pet food, and globally about Chinese-made pharmaceuticals and toothpaste, the string of toy recalls is inspiring demands for stepped up enforcement of toy safety by U.S. regulators and importers, as well as the government and industry in China.", 
                "A spokeswoman for RC2 Corp. of Illinois, the manufacturer of the Thomas Wooden Railway system, declined to comment.", 
                "Overall, the number of products made in China that are being recalled in the United States by the Consumer Product Safety Commission has doubled in the last five years, driving the overall number of recalls in the country to a record level.", 
                "It has meant that China today is responsible for about 60 percent of the overall product recalls, compared to 36 percent in 2000.", 
                "Julie Vallese, a Consumer Product Safety Commission spokeswoman, said the agency recognizes more must be done to prevent the importation of hazardous toys, and other products, from China.", 
                "\"It is a big concern.", 
                "And the agency is taking steps to try to address that as quickly as possible,\" Vallese said.", 
                "\"Their businesses will suffer if they don't meet safety standards.", 
                "\" Much of the rise in China's ranking on the recall list has to do with its corresponding surge as the source of so many products sold in the United States: Toys made in China make up 70 to 80 percent of the toys sold in the country, according to the Toy Industry Association.", 
                "The problem is most acute with low-price, no-name toys that are often sold at dollar stores and other deep discounters, as they are manufactured and sent to the United States often without the involvement of major American toy importers."

                "News that about 1.5 million wooden Thomas &amp;amp; Friends children's toys were being recalled because they were made with lead paint raised some parents' anxiety levels.", 
                "A week after the recall began, however, there have been no reports of children becoming ill from the toys.", 
                "RC2 Corp. of Oak Brook, Ill., said the recalled toys, based on the popular children's television show that began airing in the United States in 1989, were made in China between January 2005 and April 2007.", 
                "The lead paint used to decorate them could cause brain damage if ingested.", 
                "But RC2 is the only one of 30 manufacturers licensed to make Thomas &amp;amp; Friends Toys that has initiated a recall.", 
                "One of the other makers, Schylling Associated Inc. of Rowley, sells more than two dozen Thomas items.", 
                "The company said it does not use the same factories as RC2 and its toys do not have lead paint.", 
                "Schylling has received some calls from concerned customers during the past week, said spokesman Stephen Medina, but sales have not suffered.", 
                "\"We're business as usual,\" he said.", 
                "Schylling, which was founded in 1975 and has about 60 employees, is known for selling classic toys like rubber ducks and tea sets.", 
                "The company's Thomas items, from whistles to tin drums, only account for about 10 percent of its business.", 
                "RC2 said Friday that it could not provide a list of toy retailers in Massachusetts that sell its products.", 
                "Rick Henry, owner of Cambridge-based Stellabella Toys, said that that he did stock some of the recalled items, but that Thomas toys are not a major part of his business.", 
                "The toys were immediately pulled off the shelf, Henry said, and the recall information was prominently posted.", 
                "So far, he hasn't been deluged with calls from concerned customers.", 
                "\"There's been certainly a lot of press,\" he said.", 
                "\"I've been ready for it, but it really hasn't happened.", 
                "\" But business has been anything but usual for Totally Thomas Toy Depot, which specializes in Thomas &amp;amp; Friends toys.", 
                "The San Diego store, which carries more than 2,000 different kinds of Thomas toys, has been overwhelmed by inquiries about the toys.", 
                "\"We were jammed with calls,\" said Cynthia Wyatt, president of Totally Thomas Inc., which owns Totally Thomas Toy Depot.", 
                "\"Every call was about the recall.", 
                "Our 800 line was filled and it spilled into our local line.", 
                "Even our people who were running our store were jammed with calls.", 
                "They didn't even care that there was an 800 number they could call.", 
                "\" Totally Thomas, like some other retailers, has posted a message on its website,totallythomas.com, to alert customers and direct them to RC2 to find out how to send in the potentially harmful toys to be exchanged.", 
                "\"We're really concerned about getting the message to parents so they can get the toys out of the kids' hands,\" Wyatt said, noting that Totally Thomas employees have been trained to spot the dangerous toys and assist customers in the recall process.", 
                "\"I'd be willing to sacrifice sales for that,\" she said.", 
                "According to RC2, the recalled toys account for only 4 percent of its wooden railway units sold in the United States, although it declined to say how many Thomas &amp;amp; Friends toys it produces annually.", 
                "HIT Entertainment Ltd., which holds licensing rights to Thomas &amp;amp; Friends, said that last year about 50 million toys were manufactured.", 
                "RC2 will reimburse customers for postage and also give them an additional toy for free, and has added more people to its customer service line.", 
                "Wyatt said the company has been acting responsibly since it found out about the lead paint.", 
                "\"Recalls in the toy industry are not uncommon, and when it happens we usually only get some poster to post with a letter saying to pull the items off the shelves and that's pretty much all,\" she said in an e-mail.",

                "The company is also hiring an independent auditor to conduct checks, though RC2 executives have not decided whether to release the auditor's reports to the public, Stoelting said.",

                "Mattel, the maker of Barbie dolls and Hot Wheels cars, is recalling nearly 1 million toys in the United States on Thursday because the products' surfaces are covered in lead paint.", 
                "According to Mattel, all the toys were made by a contract manufacturer in China.", 
                "The recall, the second-biggest this year involving toys, covers 86 different products, manufactured between April and July 6.", 
                "Many of them feature \"Sesame Street\" and Nickelodeon characters -- including the Elmo Tub Sub, the Dora the Explorer Backpack, and the Giggle Gabber, a toy shaped like Elmo or Cookie Monster that toddlers shake to hear giggles and funny noises.", 
                "Mattel says it prevented more than two-thirds of the 967,000 affected toys from reaching consumers by contacting retailers, like Wal-Mart, Target and Toys 'R' Us, late last week.", 
                "But more than 300,000 of the tainted toys have been purchased by consumers in the United States.", 
                "A complete list can be found at nytimes.com, as well as the Web sites of Mattel and the Consumer Product Safety Commission.", 
                "In recent months, factories in China have been sources of poisonous pet food sold in stores in the United States, dangerous car tires, and lead paint on the popular Thomas &amp;amp; Friends wooden toys.", 
                "This is Mattel's 17th recall in 10 years.", 
                "Speaking of the new recall, Nancy Nord, acting Consumer Product Safety Commission chairwoman, said in a statement, \"These recalled toys have accessible lead in the paint and parents should not hesitate in taking them away from children.", 
                "\" The statement said that the commission had launched an investigation and that \"ensuring that Chinese made toys are safe for U.S. consumers is one of my highest priorities and is the subject of vital talks currently in place between CPSC and the Chinese government.", 
                "\" Earlier this summer, RC2, the maker of Thomas trains, recalled 1.5 million trains and accessories because a Chinese supplier had coated them in lead paint.", 
                "At that time, consumer safety experts and toy industry analysts said that Mattel was unlikely to face such a problem.", 
                "In early July, according to Mattel executives, one of the European retailers that sells Mattel toys discovered the lead on some products.", 
                "On July 6, Mattel stopped operations at the factory that produced the toys and initiated an investigation.", 
                "On July 18, Mattel took a reporter for The New York Times on a tour of a factory in Guanyao, China, and of Mattel's toy safety laboratory in Shenzhen.", 
                "At that time, Mattel executives say, it was unclear whether Mattel was facing a widespread lead paint problem, or if the European case was an anomaly.", 
                "Last Thursday, the company's executives say they received conclusive data that persuaded them to recall the 86 products."

                "The worldwide recall being announced Thursday involves 967,000 plastic preschool toys made by a Chinese vendor and sold in the United States between May and August.", 
                "It is the latest in a wave of recalls that has heightened global concern about the safety of Chinese-made products.", 
                "The recall is the first for Fisher-Price Inc. and parent company Mattel Inc. involving lead paint.", 
                "It is the largest for Mattel since 1998 when Fisher-Price had to yank about 10 million Power Wheels from toy stores.", 
                "In an interview with The Associated Press on Wednesday, David Allmark, general manager of Fisher-Price, said the problem was detected by an internal probe and reported to the Consumer Product Safety Commission.", 
                "Fisher-Price and the commission issued statements saying parents should keep suspect toys away from children and contact the company.", 
                "The commission works with companies to issue recalls when it finds consumer goods that can be harmful.", 
                "Under current regulations, children's products found to have more than .06 percent lead accessible to users are subject to a recall.", 
                "Allmark says the recall was \"fast-tracked,\" which allowed the company to quarantine two-thirds of the toys before they even made it to store shelves.", 
                "In negotiating details of the recall, Fisher-Price and the government agreed to withhold details from the public until Thursday to give stores time to get suspect toys off shelves and Fisher-Price time to get its recall hot line up and running.", 
                "Allmark said the recall was troubling because Fisher-Price has had a long-standing relationship with the Chinese vendor, which had applied decorative paint to the toys.", 
                "Allmark said the company would use this recall as an opportunity to put even better systems in place to monitor vendors whose conduct does not meet Mattel's standards.", 
                "He added: \"We are still concluding the investigation, how it happened.", 
                "But there will be a dramatic investigation on how this happened.", 
                "We will learn from this.", 
                "\" The recall follows another high-profile move from toy maker RC2 Corp., which in June voluntarily recalled 1.5 million wooden railroad toys and set parts from its Thomas &amp; Friends Wooden Railway product line.", 
                "The company said that the surface paint on certain toys and parts made in China between January 2005 and April 2006 contain lead, affecting 26 components and 23 retailers.", 
                "\"Anytime a company brings a banned hazardous product into the U.S. marketplace, especially one intended for children, it is unacceptable,\" said Nancy Nord, acting chair of the Consumer Product Safety Commission.", 
                "\"Ensuring that Chinese-made toys are safe for U.S. consumers is one of my highest priorities and is the subject of vital talks currently in place between CPSC and the Chinese government.", 
                "\" Carter Keithley, president of the Toy Industries Association, praised Mattel's quick response to the problem, and suggested Mattel will use this setback as a lesson for not only the company but for the entire industry.", 
                "However, he expressed concern about how the recall and other toy recalls will play out in consumers' minds in advance of the holiday season.", 
                "\"We are worried about the public feeling,\" said Keithley, adding he observed how toy companies are embracing strict controls during a recent toy safety seminar in China.", 
                "\"We have thought all along that (consumers) can be confident in the products,\" he said.", 
                "\"But if companies like Mattel have this, then you have to ask how did this happen?",

                "Mattel's announcement that it was recalling 1.5 million toys could force a reexamination of how the $22 billion toy industry is overseen by the Consumer Product Safety Commission, which largely relies on companies to report problems themselves, consumer groups, analysts and lawmakers said Thursday.", 
                "Like the 1.5 million Thomas and Friends trains and accessories recalled by RC2 Corp. in June, the Chinese-manufactured toys contained too much lead, Mattel said.", 
                "The recall was announced as safety problems with other Chinese products, such as seafood and tires, have put in doubt the U.S. government's ability to oversee imports.", 
                "``The Consumer Product Safety Commission does not have the resources to catch this type of problem,'' Mark Pryor, D-Ark., chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee's consumer affairs subcommittee, said in an interview.", 
                "``We're seeing this over and over.", 
                "This is an agency that is withering on the vine.", 
                "'' Four senators, including Majority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., sent a letter Thursday to the commission's acting chairman, Nancy Nord, requesting an assessment within seven days of whether the United States should detain and inspect all children's products from China that contain paint.", 
                "About 80 percent of the toys bought in the United States and about 65 percent of Mattel's toys are made in China, according to the Toy Industry Association and the company.", 
                "``Toys were one of the first consumer products to go to China in a big, big way,'' said Eric Johnson, a management professor at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College, who has studied the toy industry's migration to China.", 
                "About 60 percent of all product recalls this year have been for goods manufactured in China, according to the safety commission.", 
                "Lead has been a particular problem.", 
                "The agency has issued 18 recall notices for 6.7 million pieces of jewelry for children this year because of dangerous levels of lead, and nearly all of them were from China.", 
                "There were 10 lead-related recalls in 2006, according to the agency.", 
                "Mattel said that it learned of the problem with its toys -- products marketed by the company's Fisher-Price division, including toys shaped like Big Bird, Elmo and Dora the Explorer -- from a European retailer and confirmed it with its own tests.", 
                "The Chinese manufacturer, which the company refuses to identify, has worked for Mattel for 15 years and ``to the best of my knowledge'' had not had problems in the past, said David Almark, general manager and senior vice president of marketing of Fisher-Price.", 
                "Mattel is investigating the incident and stopped using the Chinese plant in early July.", 
                "Of the 1.5 million products affected, 967,000 were distributed in the United States, including about 300,000 that made it onto retail shelves, Almark said.", 
                "The recall was particularly surprising to some analysts because Mattel is known for having strict safety standards.", 
                "``It is just unfortunate -- having those standards, yet one was breached,'' Almark said.", 
                "``It shows that those (rules) were not infallible and we have to do even more.", 
                "'' The toy industry is generally considered diligent and cautious, industry analysts said.", 
                "Companies are required to report any potential problems to the safety commission, which sets industry standards and does some sample testing.", 
                "``I really think the CPSC is extremely strict as is,'' said Jim Silver, a toy industry analyst and editor of Toy Wishes magazine.", 
                "``The significance of that is that we're seeing a breakdown of that system.", 
                "It raises a question of whether the industry can continue to be self policing,'' said Christopher Byrne, an independent toy analyst known as the Toy Guy.", 
                "``If something like this can happen to Mattel, which has some of the most stringent standards, what does that mean for the industry?", 
                "'' The safety commission has begun an investigation into the Mattel recall and how such problems can be prevented, Nord said in a written statement.", 
                "Officials at Mattel ``lived up to their reporting obligation,'' agency spokeswoman Julie Vallese said.", 
                "But the incident could amplify scrutiny of the agency, which has 85 to 100 field investigators.", 
                "The three-person commission has been without a permanent chairman and a quorum since last year, which means that it cannot sue manufacturers, set civil penalties or write new rules.", 
                "The agency has proposed legislation to give it more legal authority, to make it illegal to sell recalled products, and to raise the maximum civil penalty for violations from $1.8 million to $10 million.", 
                "``The agency is running at full speed, and is also running more efficiently than it has run in the past, but would welcome additional resources that Congress may choose to provide,'' Vallese said."

                "Diane Brahams was flummoxed as she stood near the toy car aisle at a Culver City, Calif., Toys R Us on Thursday.", 
                "What would be a safe present for her grand nephew, a boy nearly 3 who loves cars?", 
                "Not long ago, Brahams wouldn't have thought the paint on a modern, name-brand toy would be a threat.", 
                "But with this week's recall of nearly a million playthings from Mattel Inc.'s Fisher-Price unit because of possible lead paint contamination, a trip to the toy store is leading Brahams and other consumers to think twice before making a purchase.", 
                "``How can I know if this is going to be safe?", 
                "'' asked Brahams, 56.", 
                "``Companies that manufacture to children need to be held to a higher standard.", 
                "'' There have been a spate of recalls of Chinese-made products, from tires to pet food, but the Mattel recall stands out in part because it involves a long-trusted brand name and because Mattel is known for setting strict production standards.", 
                "The episode shows how even the most diligent companies can run into problems as they farm out production, said Dara O'Rourke, an assistant professor of labor and environmental policy at the University of California, Berkeley.", 
                "``If it can happen to Mattel, it can happen to anybody,'' said O'Rourke, who has studied toy and other consumer goods factories in China.", 
                "``These supply chains right now are neither transparent enough nor well-managed enough even for a company that is trying very hard to be able to guarantee the safety and quality and healthfulness of their products.", 
                "'' Mattel said it was working to understand how the problem happened at a subcontractor's plant in China, and what the company could do to prevent similar issues in the future.", 
                "``I'm disappointed, and I'm upset this happened, and I apologize.", 
                "The trust of our consumers is deeply important to Mattel and to me,'' said Mattel Chief Executive Robert Eckert in an interview Thursday.", 
                "``In the long term, I think we won't be judged by the fact that a mistake was made in a vendor's plant, but instead we'll be judged on how we respond.", 
                "'' Edmund Mierzwinski, the national consumer program director for U.S. Public Interest Research Group, said U.S. companies needed to take greater responsibility for the products they import.", 
                "``If they choose not to use U.S. companies to make homegrown products, that's the bed they've chosen to lay in,'' Mierzwinski said.", 
                "``That's the challenge that these global companies face.", 
                "They've got to meet child labor laws, safety laws and they've got to have checks and balances all along the chain.", 
                "'' Lead paint, which has been banned in the U.S. for 30 years, is considered particularly dangerous for children, whose brains and nervous systems are more sensitive to the effects of lead.", 
                "The consequences can include learning disabilities, decreased intelligence, decreased muscle and bone growth, and nervous system and kidney damage.", 
                "Adults also are at risk from lead, and are commonly exposed by breathing in lead dust as a result of remodeling of older homes.", 
                "But lead in toys is especially pernicious because young children tend to put their toys in their mouths.", 
                "Dr. Robert Adler, vice chairman of pediatrics at Children's Hospital in Los Angeles, said children who have simply played with toys made with lead paint are probably at little risk of suffering health problems.", 
                "``The actual amount of lead they get from a limited exposure to the toy, while not desirable, is probably not dangerous,'' he said.", 
                "But if parents are worried that their child has been exposed to lead, Adler said they can contact their physician and request a lead test.", 
                "Results should be available within a week.", 
                "Mattel, which also makes Barbie dolls and Matchbox cars, said it was able to stop two-thirds of the 967,000 toys recalled in the United States before they hit store shelves.", 
                "But that left about 300,000 Fisher-Price toys, including a Sesame Street shape sorter for toddlers and a backpack based on popular Nickelodeon shows Dora the Explorer and Go Diego Go, in the market.", 
                "Mattel said it did not know how many consumers bought those toys, which were made between April 19 and July 6 and sold as early as May.", 
                "A total of 1.5 million toys were recalled worldwide.", 
                "(Begin optional trim) Mattel, based in El Segundo, Calif., said a retailer's audit of some products in early July first made the company aware that it might have a problem.", 
                "The company said it stopped its production at the facility where 83 different Fisher-Price toys were made, a contractor the company has used for 15 years, on July 6 or 7 and began conducting tests.", 
                "Jim Walter, Mattel's senior vice president of worldwide quality assurance, said subcontractors are required to obtain their paint from certified suppliers.", 
                "But in this case, the factory bought its paint from an unmonitored source, Walter said.", 
                "After it confirmed the problem, which Walter said was likely just with one batch of bad paint, Mattel decided to recall any products produced in the plant at the time the paint was in the factory, he said.", 
                "The company informed the Consumer Products Safety Commission of the need for a recall on July 26.", 
                "(End optional trim) Shoppers, meanwhile, expressed concern that toys with lead paint had somehow managed to find their way to store shelves.", 
                "``You're at the mercy of these companies,'' said Ann McGrath, a 60-year-old retiree from Flagstaff, Ariz. who was shopping at the Culver City Toys R Us for a present for her grandson.",
