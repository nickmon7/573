 NEW YORK _ The parents of Amadou Diallo plan to meet with the Bronx district attorney on Wednesday to receive a preview of the criminal charges that the grand jury voted to bring against the four New York City police officers who killed their son seven weeks ago.
The city's autopsy indicates that one shot struck Diallo just above the heel and traveled up the calf before lodging behind the knee, people who reviewed the report have said.
