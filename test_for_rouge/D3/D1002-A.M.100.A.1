What happened next is sure to be the subject of much debate at the future criminal trial of the four officers.
 NEW YORK _ The parents of Amadou Diallo plan to meet with the Bronx district attorney on Wednesday to receive a preview of the criminal charges that the grand jury voted to bring against the four New York City police officers who killed their son seven weeks ago.
McMellon and Carroll got out of their maroon Ford Taurus and approached Diallo on the stoop.
Diallo was hit 19 times.
