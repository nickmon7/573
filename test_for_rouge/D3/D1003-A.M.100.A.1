Wang said, Shaanxi has so far established 13 giant pandas protection zones and nature reserves focused on pandas' habitats.
Zhang Kerong, director of the Baishuijiang State Nature Preserve, said that the preserve will intervene and help giant pandas find new food source.
The government has set up more than 50 reserves, most in the southwest province of Sichuan.
Located in the giant panda breeding lab, the bank will help researchers answer questions such as how many blood types pandas have and whether they reject blood transfusions, centre sources said.
