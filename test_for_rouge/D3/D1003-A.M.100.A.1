The giant pandas will not eat the bamboo after it blooms and it takes 10 years for a new supply to grow.
Since the 1970s, many pandas in the reserve have died because of food shortages.
By the end of 2004, arrow bamboo, the favorite food of giants, had blossomed on 7,420 hectares at the Baishuijiang State Nature Reserve in southern Gansu Province, a major habitat of pandas in China, according to a recent survey conducted by the nature reserve administration.
