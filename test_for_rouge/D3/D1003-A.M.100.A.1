Giant pandas are said to have been around during the time of dinosaurs and regarded as a "national gem" of China.
Zhang Kerong, director of the Baishuijiang State Nature Preserve, said that the preserve will intervene and help giant pandas find new food source.
The giant pandas will not eat the bamboo after it blooms and it takes 10 years for a new supply to grow.
Located in the giant panda breeding lab, the bank will help researchers answer questions such as how many blood types pandas have and whether they reject blood transfusions, centre sources said.
The government has set up more than 50 reserves, most in the southwest province of Sichuan.
