Queen Elizabeth II sent a message to Papua New Guinea, which is a member of the Commonwealth, expressing her shock at the deaths.
The 23-foot (seven-meter) wall of water, called tsunami, hit Friday night without warning just after an earthquake about 12 miles (30 kilometers) off the coast.
Robert Igara, the government's chief secretary, said the population in the area affected by the tsunami was 8,000 to 10,000 people.
Australia will provide transport for relief supplies and a mobile hospital to Papua New Guinea (PNG) following Friday's tsunami tragedy.
