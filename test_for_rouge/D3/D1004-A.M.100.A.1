 PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ A tsunami spawned by a 7.0 magnitude earthquake crashed into Papua New Guinea's north coast, crushing villages and leaving hundreds missing, officials said Sunday.
The 23-foot (seven-meter) wall of water, called tsunami, hit Friday night without warning just after an earthquake about 12 miles (30 kilometers) off the coast.
