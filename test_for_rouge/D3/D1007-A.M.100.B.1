The virus is believed to be transmitted through contact with birds or their feces.
The inter-department Special Working Group was set up yesterday to coordinate efforts toward the prevention and control of the spread of the mysterious bird flu after three more people were suspected last week of having been infected with the H5NI virus, bringing the number of confirmed or suspected cases to seven.
Seven people have been infected so far, with two dead and two in critical conditions.
