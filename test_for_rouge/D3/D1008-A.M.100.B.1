Like the watermen, shuckers are born into this hearty business more often than not.
Just a few miles across the Chesapeake Bay Bridge from Annapolis, the waters of Kent Narrows, which leads to the bay, were home to 13 oyster packing houses at about the time Harris' opened in 1947.
Several organizations and federal agencies worked together to manage the project, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Oyster Recovery Partnership, a nonprofit group whose mission is to restore the bay's oyster population.
Winter in the marsh, while often frigid, turned out to be the easy season.
