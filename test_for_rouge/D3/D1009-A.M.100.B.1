Although the police chief and district attorney both have said that the Ramseys fall under ``the umbrella of suspicion,'' they have not formally named any suspects.
The Ramseys have said their son was asleep in bed when Mrs. Ramsey found the note and called 911.
``The case is going to the grand jury,'' Jim Carpenter, the governor's spokesman, said on Thursday.
The little girl's parents remain under suspicion as a grand jury investigates the crime.
The Ramseys now live in Atlanta.
