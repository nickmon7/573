The space is only 9 feet above sea level, so a storm surge as well as wind could be devastating.
Though not as large as Floyd, Gert, the fifth hurricane of the season, was expected to pound through the Atlantic with winds well over 100 mph.
A fourth is in the 525-foot-high Vehicle Assembly Building, which is designed to withstand wind of up to 125 mph.
Like Andrew in 1992, which killed 40 people, wrecked 160 homes and caused more than $25 billion in damages, Floyd was a category 4 storm on Monday.
That put it on the verge of becoming a Category 5 storm, which features top sustained wind of more than 156 mph and is capable of causing extreme damage.
