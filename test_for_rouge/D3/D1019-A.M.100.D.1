It was however confirmed that among the hostages, there are 11 foreigners -- three Germans, two South Africans, two French nationals, two Finns, one Lebanese and one Filipino while the rest nine are Malaysians comprising four workers of the Wildlife Department, three workers of the Sipadan resort center, a policeman and a staff of Syarikat Borneo Divers.
Meanwhile, Malaysian Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar also held a news conference earlier Monday on the incident, saying that all the 20 people taken hostage by armed pirates were safe.
The hostages were said to have been taken onto a boat and are now at sea.
He said the ground troops were pursuing fleeing rebels, and the troops next plan to advance to the main stronghold further up the mountain, he said.
The rebels have demanded the freedom of three Arab terrorist suspects in U.S. jails, including Ramzi Yousef, mastermind of the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center in New York, and Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, accused of conspiring to blow up New York City landmarks.
