Tokyo will reportedly tell the IWC at a meeting starting this month in South Korea that it intends to nearly double its annual catch of minke whales in the Antarctic Ocean, currently set at 440.
Japanese media reports have said it will seek nearly to double its annual catch of Minke whales, currently set at 440, in the Antarctic and to catch the larger humpback and fin whales which are considered endangered by the World Conservation Union.
The Japanese plan is due to go before the International Whaling Commission (IWC) when it meets in South Korea next month.
