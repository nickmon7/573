Campbell said the catching of humpback whales, which migrate the west and east coasts of Australia in increasing numbers, "is something that will potentially seriously damage the way Australians perceive Japan.
He said the government had not taken strong enough steps to stop Japanese whaling companies from operating in Australian waters.
The opposition Labor Party assailed the government's intervention in the case, which coincides with efforts by Japan to gain permission from the International Whaling Commission (IWC) to double the number of whales it can kill each year.
Conservation Minister Chris Carter told NZPA, a news agency, that he understands the Japanese want to add 80 of each of hampback and fin whales to its legal kill lists.
