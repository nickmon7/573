Japan has said it will push for a widening of its scientific whaling program at a meeting of the IWC that also began Friday in Ulsan, South Korea.
Japanese media reports have said it will seek nearly to double its annual catch of Minke whales, currently set at 440, in the Antarctic and to catch the larger humpback and fin whales which are considered endangered by the World Conservation Union.
 An animal rights group on Friday lost a bid to sue a Japanese whaling company for allegedly killing hundreds of whales inside an Australian whale sanctuary.
