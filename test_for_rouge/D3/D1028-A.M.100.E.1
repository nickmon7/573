 WASHINGTON, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Unabomber suspect Theodore J. Kaczynski pleaded innocent today via video to charges he sent the mail bomb killing an advertising executive exactly two years ago.
The mail bomb terrorist killed three people and injured 23 others in 18 years.
In an order filed late Friday afternoon and distributed by a court document service today, U.S. District Judge Garland Burrell Jr. in Sacramento, California, said defense lawyers Quin Denvir and Judy Clarke had failed to prove the necessity of expanding the jury pool beyond the list of registered voters, media reports said.
