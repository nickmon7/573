More than 3,000 government employees and their families escaped Saturday in vehicles under paramilitary escort from Dera Bugti after a 16-hour battle in the town last week.
Fighting lasted all day Thursday after the heavily-armed clansmen, who want more autonomy and increased benefits from the area's natural resources, ambushed a convoy of paramilitary Frontier Corps soldiers, officials said.
It was an alarming escalation of a low-level rebellion in Baluchistan, the country's poorest province, where tribesmen are demanding more returns from the natural gas extracted from their territory and resent the army's moves to set up garrisons in the region.
