The Indonesian Volcanic and Geological Disaster Mitigation Directorate (DVMBG) said on Friday 28 areas in the country are prone to tsunami tidal waves and called on local administrations and people to stay alert for such natural disasters.
Mangroves grow in thickets along tropical coastlines and have tangled roots that grow above ground.
The agency reported one case in Thailand where the mangroves also damaged shallow coral reefs.
Most of the 28 areas provinces on Sumatra, Sulawesi, Java and Papua islands.
Scientists don't have comprehensive historical data about marine damage that tsunamis can cause, especially one of this magnitude.
