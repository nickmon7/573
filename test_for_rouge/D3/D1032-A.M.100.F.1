Magne Ognedal, director general of the safety authority, said his staff is working intensely on reviewing a startup proposal submitted by Statoil this week, but needs more information.
"We have stopped production" at Snorre A, Kristofer Hetland, a spokesman for Statoil, told AFP.
Bad weather was in part blamed for Statoil ASA being unable to restart 205,000 barrels per day of production from two other fields, Snorre and Vigdis, which were shut down after a Nov. 28 natural gas leak.
The 36 workers aboard the platform pumped heavy drilling mud into the leaking injection well.
