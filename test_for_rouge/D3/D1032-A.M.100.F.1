The Snorre oil field where the Snorre A and Snorre B platforms are located produces a total 238,000 barrels per day, according to the Statoil website.
No one was hurt, he said.
Bad weather was in part blamed for Statoil ASA being unable to restart 205,000 barrels per day of production from two other fields, Snorre and Vigdis, which were shut down after a Nov. 28 natural gas leak.
"The mud is intended to push back the gas so that we can get at the well to halt the leak," Reinertsen said.
