No one was hurt, he said.
"The safety aspect has top priority at the moment," Reinertsen said.
The gas leak, which led to the evacuation of 180 workers from the floating Snorre A platform located northwest of the port city of Bergen, was contained Monday afternoon, nearly 18 hours after it was reported, Statoil spokesman Oeivind Reinertsen said.
"We are still working on securing the well," Statoil spokesman Kristofer Hetland told AFP.
The 36 workers aboard the platform pumped heavy drilling mud into the leaking injection well.
