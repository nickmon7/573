Hong came under pressure to resign as suspicions arose that he might have acted as an intermediary between the country's largest conglomerate Samsung and politicians and handed out Samsung's slush funds to presidential candidates in 1997.
Hong, the publisher of leading newspaper Joongang Ilbo, was named as ambassador to the US in February.
"I ask for the forgiveness of the Korean people for past illegal wiretapping," National Intelligence Service chief Kim Seung-kew said, reading a statement to reporters.
Hong's resignation requires procedural steps such a letter recalling him from Washington.
