"I am in agony over how to deal with information collected through illegal wiretapping...this requires cautious judgement," Roh said.
Kim "never received any report of such illegal activities" during his presidency, Choi Gyung-hwan, Kim's secretary, said in a statement.
Roh made the remarks while presiding over a weekly meeting with senior presidential aides in earlier Monday, Roh's spokesman Kim Man-soo said.
"I ask for the forgiveness of the Korean people for past illegal wiretapping," National Intelligence Service chief Kim Seung-kew said, reading a statement to reporters.
Kim Dae-jung's office expressed "profound regret" over the spy agency's admission of wiretapping during his government.
