Kim "never received any report of such illegal activities" during his presidency, Choi Gyung-hwan, Kim's secretary, said in a statement.
Hong, the publisher of leading newspaper Joongang Ilbo, was named as ambassador to the US in February.
News of the resignation came on the same day that six-nation talks in Beijing, aimed at getting North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons program, resumed after a 13-month hiatus.
