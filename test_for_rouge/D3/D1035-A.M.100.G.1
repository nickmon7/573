No one knows how many people suffer from the effects of Agent Orange, which was sprayed over wide swaths of jungle by U.S. planes during a 10-year period to strip away cover from enemy troops and their convoys.
During the Vietnam war, the Americans sprayed 42 million liters of toxic chemicals, most of it Agent Orange, said Vietnam News, adding that the victims include people who lived and worked in areas sprayed between 1961 and 1971 southwards of the 17th parallel.
About 2.1 million U.S. military personnel served in Vietnam during the period.
