Combined, these factors have caused a stunning decline in Maryland oyster harvests: from about 2,600,000 bushels in 1974-75 to about 26,000 bushels last year.
The dwindling supply of oysters in the Chesapeake Bay -- last season's haul was about 24,000 bushels, less than 1 percent of what it was three decades ago -- has hurt him the most.
For early settlers, oyster reefs were so abundant that they posed a hazard for navigation, and with the introduction of canning in the 1800s, the Chesapeake became the source for oysters around the world.
