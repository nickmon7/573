 A plume of steam and ash rose from the crater of Mount St. Helens on Friday, CNN reported. 
 Government scientists raised the alert level for Mount St. Helens after its second steam eruption in two days was followed by a powerful tremor.
The ash could be accompanied by lava flow and possibly blow much farther northwest, depending on the weather, and cause health problems for anyone with asthma or other respiratory diseases, said Dr. Thomas Pierson, a geologist with the geological survey.
