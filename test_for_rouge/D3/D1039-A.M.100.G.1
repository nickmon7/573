A feminist politician who starred in van Gogh's film accused authorities of failing to prevent a crime foretold.
Van Gogh, the great great nephew of 19th-century Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh, was a staunch critic of multicultural society as a whole.
Dutch Foreign Minister Bernard Bot stressed that the murder "should not lead to animosity between certain groups in society".
Shortly after the killing, the police arrested a 26-year-old man of dual Dutch and Moroccan nationality, whom they refused to name.
