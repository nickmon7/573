The red-colored dye, which is used for coloring industrial products such as gasoline and shoe polish, was found in a batch of chilli powder used by the British company Premier Foods to make Worcester sauce, which was then added as an ingredient in a wide range of products.
 Britain's food safety watchdog ordered the recall of more than 350 food products Friday after it said that a potentially cancer-causing dye had been discovered.
It was uncovered when Italian authorities carried out tests on a batch of Worcestershire sauce shipped to Italy from England.
