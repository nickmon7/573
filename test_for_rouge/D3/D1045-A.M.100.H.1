Benzene is a substance harmful to human health.
Yin Fazhang, deputy chief engineer of the Heilongjiang Provincial Hydrological Bureau, said that nearly 90 percent of residents living along the downstream section in Harbin rely on underground water as their source of drinking water.
The Songhua River, a tributary of the Heilongjiang River which is called the Amur when it crosses the border, is contaminated by benzene due to a massive petrochemical plant explosion on November 13.
