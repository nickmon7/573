from Tokyo to Europe to top US investors, all of them apparently unaware until the broker's arrest Thursday that they were being conned.", "Prosecutors allege that Madoff, a decades-long veteran of Wall Street and pillar of the US financial community, confessed to losing at least 50 billion dollars in the so-called Ponzi scheme, or pyramid fraud.", "US newspapers detailed how Madoff, 70, traded on his impeccable reputation and access to exclusive country clubs to cultivate A-list investment clients including big banks, hedge funds and individuals.", "The Securities and Exchange Commission alleges he delivered consistently strong returns by secretly using the principal from new investors to pay out to other investors.", "As long as he could attract new investors the alleged scheme worked.", "The plot appears to have unraveled when clients asked to withdraw their principal -- as they have been doing from hedge funds worldwide -- only to discover that Madoff's seemingly brimming coffers were empty.", "According to The Wall Street Journal, investors facing losses include French bank BNP Paribas, Tokyo-based Nomura Holdings and Zurich's Neue Privat Bank.", "Spanish newspapers reported that a fund run by leading bank Santander was heavily exposed and that investors in Spain risk losing some three billion dollars.", "Swiss bankers face losses of up to five billion dollars,

included the former owner of the Philadelphia Eagles American football team Norman Braman, according to news reports.", "Hedge funds are likely to take an especially big hit because Madoff was handling money for several companies raising money for such funds, the Journal said.", "\"I'm wiped out,\" the Journal quoted Sandra Manzke, chairman of one such company, Maxam Capital Management, as saying after reporting 280 million dollars in losses.", "The New York Times reported that a hedge fund advisory firm, Fairfield Greenwich Group, had invested 7.5 billion dollars with Madoff.", "As federal investigators poured over the books at Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, the Times highlighted the apparent lack of oversight through the years of what appears set to be Wall Street's record-sized fraud.", "Despite Madoff's amazingly high and consistent returns and the fact that a relatively unknown accounting firm was doing his audits, the Securities and Exchange Commission \"appears to have been completely surprised,\" the Times wrote.", "\"Despite these and other red flags, hedge fund companies kept promoting Mr Madoff\u2019s funds to other funds and individuals,\" the Times wrote.", "Among those recruiting investors on Madoff's behalf, the Times reported, were Japan's Nomura.", "The debacle has \"swept up some of the most prominent and wealthy Americans, along with many people who thought they were embarking on a comfortable retirement and have now been left destitute,\" the Journal quoted a lawyer for another victim, Milberg LLP, as saying."]}, {"headline": "Investor's Business `All Just One Big Lie,' SEC

ivory inside, conservation and law enforcement agencies realized that they had intercepted the largest shipment of the contraband material since its international trade was banned in 1989.", "They knew that the container had been shipped from South Africa, but they didn't know precisely where the ivory -- 532 tusks and more than 42,000 small cylinders called hankos -- came from.", "One theory was that it came from Zambia and nearby Malawi, suggesting that elephant poaching in that part of Africa was more intense than recognized.", "But many officials thought that ivory came from throughout sub-Saharan Africa, suggesting organized continentwide poaching and smuggling.", "A DNA analysis by Samuel K. Wasser of the University of Washington and colleagues appears to have settled the issue.", "The ivory, they report in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, most likely came from a narrow region across southern Africa centered on Zambia.", "The DNA technique, developed by Wasser.", "analyzes the slight variations in specific genes among elephants from different regions and different habits (savanna vs. forest).", "The technique had been applied to ivory from individual elephants, but the new work uses statistical methods to apply it across a group.", "(The researchers sampled ivory from 37 tusks in the shipment; the hankos are still being analyzed.", ") The tusk analysis allowed investigators to focus on one part of Africa rather than the whole continent, and prompted changes in the way Zambia deals with poachers.", "But, the researchers say not much progress has been made in the case, and there is more ivory smuggling now than at any time since the ban started.", "In addition to work like theirs, they say, more outside aid needs to be provided for enforcement efforts in Zambia and elsewhere.", "THE GOOD, THE BAD IN CIRCUIT BOARD Recycling electronic devices isn't easy, and recycling the heart of a computer or other device -- the printed circuit board -- is among the most difficult tasks of all.", "The problem with circuit boards is that they are a complex sandwich of materials, mostly glass-reinforced resins and metals.", "Because there are billions of circuit boards around and because some of the materials are valuable (including metals like copper and gold) and some toxic (including heavy metals and flame retardants), it can pay to keep them out of landfills or incinerators.", "But methods of separating circuit board materials often involve heat or chemicals or both, and that can create additional environmental problems.", "Jia Li and colleagues at Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China have developed and tested an environmentally friendly recycling method that uses technology similar to what might be found in a laser printer.", "The technique is described in the journal Environmental Science and Technology.", "First, components like switches and capacitors (which can contain toxic metals) are stripped from the boards.", "Then the boards are crushed, effectively breaking them down into metallic and nonmetallic particles.", "These are separated using an electrostatic method, essentially the same technique that spreads toner across a rotating drum in a laser printer to produce a page.", "The separation process uses a metal drum, too, that the mixed particles fall onto.", "The nonmetallic particles pick up a static charge, while a stronger charge is induced in the metallic particles.", "Both stick to the drum, but the metallic particles are immediately discharged to an electrode.", "Without a charge, they fall off the drum into a hopper.", "The nonmetallic particles remain on the drum as it rotates, eventually being scraped off so that they fall into another hopper.", "The metals can then be separated using conventional techniques, while the researchers experimented with turning the resinous particles into a kind of nonmetallic plate that they suggest could be used as insulating boards or other building materials."]}, {"headline": "DNA from ivory may lead to

of organized crime, with narcotics and other contraband often being shipped with the tusks.", "Ivory prices have skyrocketed, Wasser said, and the incentives for killing elephants for their tusks have never been higher.", "Wasser's report, published in the online version of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, also described a unique effort to determine the origins of 532 unusually large tusks confiscated in Singapore in 2002.", "Using DNA analysis, the group led by Wasser determined that the tusks came from African savannah elephants similar to those found in and around the

international ivory sales in 1989, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), allows limited sales of tusks harvested from animals that die naturally if the home government can demonstrate it is doing a good job of controlling poaching.", "In its request, Zambia said 135 elephants had been illegally killed in the country in the past decade, but the researchers estimated that between 3,000 and 6,500 Zambian elephants had been killed for their tusks in the short period before the Singapore shipment.", "Much of the funding for the DNA analysis came

Animal Welfare.", "(End Optional Trim) Wasser and other authors, who include a member of Interpol and officials at African conservation programs, said an aggressive and well-funded anti-poaching program could be highly effective now because the DNA testing can pinpoint where the animals are being killed.", "The report also said an education program in East Asia is essential to curb the demand for ivory.", "``I don't think people in China and Japan fully understand the crisis that their ivory purchases have caused,'' Wasser said.", "As a model, he proposed something similar to a current Chinese campaign against eating shark-fin soup.", "In it, he said, a popular basketball player asks ``What's wrong with us that we kill the sharks for the fin?", "'' While the 1989 ban forbids all unapproved sales of ivory between nations, illegal material that slips through can become legal once it turns up in a new country.", "Before the 1989 ban, most smuggled ivory was shipped to Europe,

Cyrus Mody, manager of the International Maritime Bureau.", "\"It had been slightly more easy to get it under control in the Gulf of Aden because it is a comparatively smaller area of water which has to be patrolled, but this is huge.", "\" The tanker, which is owned by Saudi oil company Aramco, is one of the largest ships to sail the seas.", "It is 330 meters (1,080 feet) long, or about the length of an aircraft carrier, and can carry about 2 million barrels of oil.", "Lt. Nathan Christensen, a spokesman for the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet, said the Sirius Star was carrying crude at the time of the hijacking, but he did know how much.", "He also had no details about where the ship was sailing from and where it was headed at the time of the attack.", "He said the bandits were taking it to an anchorage off the Somali port of Eyl.", "The port on Somalia's northeastern coast has become a pirate haven and a number of ships are already being held there as pirates try to force ransoms.", "The ship was sailing under a Liberian flag and its 25-member crew includes citizens of Croatia, Britain, the Philippines, Poland and Saudi Arabia.", "A British Foreign Office spokesman said there were at least two British nationals aboard the vessel.", "The Sirius Star was attacked more than 450 nautical miles southeast of Mombasa, Kenya, the U.S. 5th Fleet said in a statement from its Middle East headquarters in Bahrain.", "\"It's the largest ship we've seen hijacked and one attacked farthest out on the sea,\" Christensen said.", "The capturing of the oil tanker represents a \"fundamental shift in the ability of pirates to be able to attack merchant vessels,\" he said.", "The Sirius Star was built in South Korea's Daewoo shipping yards and commissioned in March.", "Classed as a Very Large Crude Carrier, the ship is 318,000 dead weight tons.", "If it were fully loaded, the ship's deck would be lower to the water, making it easier for pirates to climb aboard with grappling equipment and ladders, as they do in most hijackings.", "It is not clear if there was a security team on board the vessel.", "An operator with Aramco said there was no one available at the company to comment after business hours.", "Calls went unanswered at Vela international, the Dubai-based marine company that operated the ship for Aramco.", "Somali pirates are trained fighters, often dressed in military fatigues, using speedboats equipped with satellite phones and GPS equipment.", "They are typically armed with automatic weapons, anti-tank rockets launchers and various types of grenades.", "As pirates have become better armed and equipped, they have sailed farther out to sea in search of bigger targets, including oil tankers, among the 20,000 tankers, freighters and merchant vessels transiting the Gulf of Aden each year.", "Attacks have increased more than 75 percent this year.", "With most attacks ending with million-dollar payouts, piracy is considered the biggest economy in Somalia.", "Pirates rarely hurt their hostages, instead holding out for a huge payday.", "The strategy works well: A report last month by a London-based think tank said pirates have raked in up to $30 million in ransoms this year alone.", "In Somalia, pirates are better-funded, better-organized and better-armed than one might imagine in a country that has been in tatters for nearly two decades.", "They do occasionally get nabbed, however.", "Earlier this year, French commandos used night vision goggles and helicopters in operations that killed or captured several pirates, who are now standing trial in Paris.", "The stepped-up international presence recently also appears to have deterred several attacks.", "Raja Kiwan, a Dubai-based analyst with PFC Energy, said the hijacking raises \"some serious questions\" about what is needed to secure such ships when they are on the open seas.", "\"It's not easy to take over a ship\" as massive as an oil tanker, particularly VLCC's that can transport about 2 million barrels of crude, he said.", "He said such vessels typically have an armed security contingent on board but could not say if that was the case with the Sirius Star.", "Pirates have gone after oil tankers before.", "In October, a Spanish military patrol plane thwarted pirates trying to hijack an oil tanker by buzzing them three times and dropping smoke canisters.", "On April 21, pirates fired rocket-propelled grenades at a Japanese oil tanker, leaving a hole that allowed several hundred gallons of fuel to leak out, raising fears for the environment.", "In September, three pirates in a speed boat fired machine guns at an Iranian crude oil carrier, though the ship escaped after a 30-minute chase.", "Warships from the more than a dozen nations as well as NATO forces have focused their anti-piracy patrols in the Gulf of Aden, increasing their military presence in recent months.", "But Saturday's hijacking occurred much farther south, highlighting weaknesses in the international response to the problem.", "\"The coalition has suppressed a number of attacks ... but there will never be enough warships,\" said Graeme Gibbon Brooks, the managing director of British company Dryad Maritime Intelligence Service Ltd. \"The whole area is 2.5 million square miles (6.5 million square kilometers) ... the coalition have to act preemptively and be one step ahead of the pirates.", "The difficulty here is that the ship was beyond the area where the coalition were currently acting.", "\" ------ Associated Press writers Katharine Houreld and Elizabeth A.

to see if their products are harmless.", "And it has China, again, insisting that its products are safe.", "On Thursday, Mattel's Fisher-Price brand announced it is recalling 83 types of toys -- including the popular Big Bird, Elmo, Dora and Diego characters -- because their paint contains excessive amounts of lead.", "The recall involves 967,000 plastic preschool toys made by a Chinese vendor and sold in the United States between May and August.", "\"I'm less inclined to buy anything from China,\" said Wendy Schneider-Fisher, of New Albany, Ohio, who was heading into a local Toys

could find a similar toy that was American made, I would definitely buy it even if it cost more,\" said Allen Mayne, of Columbus, Ohio, who was shopping at a local Toys \"R\" Us for his 9-year-old

said.", "With discounters like Wal-Mart Stores Inc. waging price wars, the pressure has been on toy companies to cut costs by producing cheaper toys in China.", "With exceptions like Mattel, which estimates that about 50 percent of its production in China is made in company-owned plants, many toy companies turn to contract factories, a cheaper alternative.", "Thursday's toy recall follows the June recall by RC2 Corp. of 1.5 million wooden railroad toys and set parts from its Thomas &amp; Friends Wooden Railway product line because of lead paint.", "Those toys were also made in China.",

as a role model in how to do business in China, remained in crisis control Thursday.", "The company contends the recall was \"fast-tracked,\" allowing it to quarantine two-thirds of the toys before they even made it to stores.", "Still, executives are trying to find out how this situation happened.", "\"There is an extreme sense of urgency,\" said David Allmark, general manager of Fisher-Price.", "Jim Walter, senior vice president of worldwide quality assurance for Mattel, is heading to China to meet with vendors.", "China also moved to clear up another blot on its reputation.", "\"China has always conducted international trade in the spirit of being responsible to its trade partners and itself,\" China's Commerce Minister Bo Xilai said in a statement published Thursday on the ministry's Web site.", "\"Ninety-nine percent of China's exports are good and safe.", "\" There is also increasing pressure for government regulation of the U.S. toy industry.", "Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin introduced a bill last month that he contended would dramatically expand the Consumer Product Safety Commission's ability to protect the public.", "Another piece of legislation, introduced by Durbin and Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson would require third-party testing of imported and domestic toys and goods designed for children 5 years old or younger.", "The CPSC now allows manufacturers to inspect and approve their own children's products.", "\"We need better regulation of the toy industry.", "Until then, parents are going to have to be the watchdogs,\" said Joanne Oppenheim, president of Oppenheim Toy

Hasbro-owned factories as well as factories that are contracted to produce Hasbro-branded product.", "\" Sesame Workshop, the nonprofit group that produces the \"Sesame Street\" TV program said Thursday it plans independent audits and other steps in an attempt to hold licensees to the highest health and safety standards.", "Retailers including KB Toys Inc., Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Toys

largely relies on companies to report problems themselves, consumer groups, analysts and lawmakers said Thursday.", "Like the 1.5 million Thomas and Friends trains and accessories recalled by RC2 Corp. in June, the Chinese-manufactured toys contained too much lead, Mattel said.", "The recall was announced as safety problems with other Chinese products, such as seafood and tires, have put in doubt the U.S. government's ability to oversee imports.", "``The Consumer Product Safety Commission does not have the resources to catch this type of problem,'' Mark Pryor, D-Ark., chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee's consumer affairs subcommittee, said in an interview.", "``We're seeing this over and over.", "This is an agency that is withering on the vine.", "'' Four senators, including Majority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., sent a letter Thursday to the commission's acting chairman, Nancy Nord, requesting an assessment within seven days of whether the United States should detain and inspect all children's products from China that contain paint.", "About 80 percent of the toys bought in the United States and about 65 percent of Mattel's toys are made in China, according to the Toy Industry Association and the company.", "``Toys were one of the first consumer products to go to China in a big, big way,'' said Eric Johnson, a management professor at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College, who has studied the toy industry's migration to China.", "About 60 percent of all product recalls this year have been for goods manufactured in China, according to the safety commission.", "Lead has been a particular problem.", "The agency has issued 18 recall notices for 6.7 million pieces of jewelry for children this year because of dangerous levels of lead, and nearly all of them were from China.", "There were 10 lead-related recalls in 2006, according to the agency.", "Mattel said that it learned of the problem with its toys -- products marketed by the company's Fisher-Price division, including toys shaped like Big Bird, Elmo and Dora the Explorer -- from a European retailer and confirmed it with its own tests.", "The Chinese manufacturer, which the company refuses to identify, has worked for Mattel for 15 years and ``to the best of my knowledge'' had not had problems in the past, said David Almark, general manager and senior vice president of marketing of Fisher-Price.", "Mattel is investigating the incident and stopped using the Chinese plant in early July.", "Of the 1.5 million products affected, 967,000 were distributed in the United States, including about 300,000 that made it onto retail shelves, Almark said.", "The recall was particularly surprising to some analysts because Mattel is known for having strict safety standards.", "``It is just unfortunate -- having those standards, yet one was breached,'' Almark said.", "``It shows that those (rules) were not infallible and we have to do even more.", "'' The toy industry is generally considered diligent and cautious, industry analysts said.", "Companies are required to report any potential problems to the safety commission, which sets industry standards and does some sample testing.", "``I really think the CPSC is extremely strict as is,'' said Jim Silver, a toy industry analyst and editor of Toy Wishes magazine.", "``The significance of that is that we're seeing a breakdown of that system.", "It raises a question of whether the industry can continue to be self policing,'' said Christopher Byrne, an independent toy analyst known as the Toy Guy.", "``If something like this can happen to Mattel, which has some of the most stringent standards, what does that mean for the industry?", "'' The safety commission has begun an investigation into the Mattel recall and how such problems can be prevented, Nord said in a written statement.", "Officials at Mattel ``lived up to their reporting obligation,'' agency spokeswoman Julie Vallese said.", "But the incident could amplify scrutiny of the agency, which has 85 to 100 field investigators.", "The three-person commission has been without a permanent chairman and a quorum since last year, which means that it cannot sue manufacturers, set civil penalties or write new rules.", "The agency has proposed legislation to give it more legal authority, to make it illegal to sell recalled products, and to raise the maximum civil penalty for violations from $1.8 million to $10 million.", "``The agency is running at full speed, and is also running more efficiently than it has run in the past, but would welcome additional resources that Congress may choose to provide,'' Vallese said."]}, {"headline": "Toy Recall Leaves Customers Spooked", "id": "LTW_ENG_20070803.0053", "wordCounts": {"limited": 1,

Fisher-Price unit because of possible lead paint contamination, a trip to the toy store is leading Brahams and other consumers to think twice before making a purchase.", "``How can I know if this is going to be safe?", "'' asked Brahams, 56.", "``Companies that manufacture to children need to be held to a higher standard.", "'' There have been a spate of recalls of Chinese-made products, from tires to pet food, but the Mattel recall stands out in part because it involves a long-trusted brand name and because Mattel is known for setting strict production standards.", "The episode shows how even the most diligent companies can run into problems as they farm out production, said Dara O'Rourke, an assistant professor of labor and environmental policy at the University of California, Berkeley.", "``If it can happen to Mattel, it can happen to anybody,'' said O'Rourke, who has studied toy and other consumer goods factories in China.", "``These supply chains right now are neither transparent enough nor well-managed enough even for a company that is trying very hard to be able to guarantee the safety and quality and healthfulness of their products.", "'' Mattel said it was

happened, and I apologize.", "The trust of our consumers is deeply important to Mattel and to me,'' said Mattel Chief Executive Robert Eckert in an interview Thursday.", "``In the long term, I think we won't be judged by the fact that a mistake was made in a vendor's plant, but instead we'll be judged on how we respond.", "'' Edmund Mierzwinski, the national consumer program director for U.S.

are at risk from lead, and are commonly exposed by breathing in lead dust as a result of remodeling of older homes.", "But lead in toys is especially pernicious because young children tend to put their toys in their mouths.", "Dr. Robert Adler, vice chairman of pediatrics at Children's Hospital in Los Angeles, said children who have simply played with toys made with lead paint are probably at little risk of suffering health problems.", "``The actual amount of lead they get from a limited exposure to the toy, while not desirable, is probably not dangerous,'' he said.", "But if parents are worried that their child has been exposed to lead, Adler said they can contact their physician and request a lead test.", "Results should be available within a week.", "Mattel, which also makes Barbie dolls and Matchbox cars, said it was able to stop two-thirds of the 967,000 toys recalled in the United States before they hit store shelves.", "But that left about 300,000 Fisher-Price toys,

83 different Fisher-Price toys were made, a contractor the company has used for 15 years, on July 6 or 7 and began conducting tests.", "Jim Walter, Mattel's senior vice president of worldwide quality assurance, said subcontractors are required to obtain their paint from certified suppliers.", "But in this case, the factory bought its paint from an unmonitored source, Walter said.", "After it confirmed the problem, which Walter said was likely just with one batch of bad paint, Mattel decided to recall any products produced in the plant at the time the paint was in the factory, he said.", "The company informed the Consumer Products Safety Commission of the need for a recall on July 26.", "(End optional trim) Shoppers, meanwhile, expressed concern that toys with lead paint had somehow

them.", "'' The Post last week gave the Army six days to respond to the paper's investigation into decaying, cockroach-infested facilities and an overwhelmed patient-care bureaucracy at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Northwest Washington.", "The Army's public affairs office used the time to summon journalists from other news organizations to a briefing at which Walter Reed's commander responded to the findings -- in an article that had not yet been published.", "``It made us feel very uncomfortable that we were being set up to be the Army's public affairs arm,'' said Los Angeles

of who says they had the right of discovery.", "'' Priest first contacted the Army on Monday, Feb. 12, and provided a list of 30 questions about conditions at Walter Reed.", "She said Weightman was responsive during a two-hour interview Thursday, Feb. 15, but she initially thought he was joking when he said he would be briefing other news organizations on Walter Reed's problems the following day.", "At the Friday briefing, reporters were told that Weightman's remarks were embargoed until late Saturday afternoon, around the time The Post's story was expected to be posted online.", "That, said Baggio, was done as a ``courtesy.", "'' After an internal debate, said Spiegel of the Los Angeles Times, ``it seemed to us pointless to try to cobble something together'' without The Post's findings.", "But the Army succeeded in putting its stamp on some stories.", "An AP report Saturday evening began: ``The commander of the Army's leading medical facility acknowledges problems in outpatient treatment but said the hospital is working to address the concerns of patients and their families.", "'' Spiegel's Times piece Sunday said Weightman ``has acknowledged that the staff responsible for tracking patients after they receive treatment was overwhelmed by the number of wounded when violence spiked in Iraq two years ago.", "'' Both reports said Weightman spoke in advance of The Post's stories.", "Army officials are now questioning the paper's handling of the probe.", "In a letter to Walter Reed's staff this week, Weightman said that ``information for this article was covertly obtained over more than two years by reporters who did not wish to bring their findings to the leadership for action.", "'' Priest, saying the inquiry lasted four months, not two years, declined to explain how she and Hull repeatedly signed into Walter Reed without the knowledge of the Army brass.", "Every patient or family member quoted by name, she said, had agreed to be on the record.", "``We never lied to anyone about who we were,'' Priest said.", "``We just tried not to be in a position to identify ourselves to anyone who would report us to public affairs and have us kicked off the base.", "'' As for Weightman's complaint that the paper should have notified the Army of its conclusions earlier in the process, Priest called that ``ridiculous,'' saying: ``You find wrongdoing and you don't report it to the public first?", "You report it to them first?", "That's not our role."]}, {"headline": "bc-walterreed", "id": "LTW_ENG_20070224.0090", "wordCounts": {"our":

in the scuffle over scarce resources.", "For Arizona water managers, the $280 million desalter represented a way to stretch the Colorado River a little further, hedging against drought and growing demand.", "Up and running, the desalter could convert billions of gallons of agriculture wastewater each year into a usable resource, preserving long-term storage in Lake Mead and protecting Arizona from shortages.", "For environmental groups, the plant embodied a destructive \"use-it-up\" attitude about water and a direct threat to a thriving wetland 90 miles south in Sonora.", "The agriculture wastewater intended for desalination feeds the wetland, providing habitat for birds and fish, and supports a small local economy.", "Without the water, the wetland would dry up.", "Not quite three years ago, on a beach in the bottom of the Grand Canyon, a water manager and an environmentalist struck up a conversation.", "Before long, they were working on a plan that would ultimately recast the desalter as a symbol of two disparate interests finding common ground.", "The plan faces its first test in early March, when the federal government restarts the plant for a 90-day, low-power test run.", "Officially, the test will help determine whether the desalter still works, how much operating it full time would cost and how it would affect the wetland known as the Cienega de Santa Clara, a critical habitat for migratory birds.", "But the test will provide more than just technical data.", "It also will bring together the West's water buffaloes - the use-it-up gang - and the increasingly influential conservation movement for a grand experiment in the management and the politics of water.", "\"The Colorado River is absolutely a finite resource, and we have to be careful in how we manage it,\" said Jennifer Pitt, a senior resource analyst for the advocacy group Environmental Defense who was part of that first campfire conversation.", "\"But the truth is there's a lot of water there.", "We've seen time and time again that the law of the river can be flexible enough to meet the needs of water users in the basin.", "There can be benefits for everybody.", "\" The history Standing on the main floor of the Yuma Desalination Plant, surrounded by long rows of fiberglass membranes stacked more than 7 feet high, Jim Cherry can't help but smile.", "\"These are exciting times here,\" said Cherry, Yuma area manager for the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, which operates the desalter.", "\"Crews are busy checking pipes, checking pumps, checking for leaks.", "People have been working here 15 years or more, and we've never really operated the plant.", "\" The desalter's original purpose was to help the United States meet the terms of a water-quality treaty with Mexico, which protested the increasing levels of salt and other nutrients in the Colorado River by the time it reached the border.", "The bureau decided to divert water drained from farm fields in the nearby Wellton-Mohawk Valley, remove the salt and send it down the river.", "After floods washed away one of the diversion canals in 1992, the bureau mothballed the plant, just nine months after turning it on.", "A series of wet years rendered it unnecessary.", "Since then, Cherry has presided over a group of caretakers, who kept the plant in working condition, and a group of scientists who developed a water-treatment research center using a one-hundredth scale version of the plant.", "Cherry said the researchers used the time well.", "They increased the plant's efficiency from a 73 percent recovery rate, when 10 gallons of raw water produced slightly more than seven gallons of treated water, to about 85 percent.", "They also tried desalting local groundwater to see if the plant could produce drinking water someday for small communities on either side of the border.", "\"The plant was authorized to do one thing,\" Cherry said, \"but we can study whether we could do other things.", "\" It's the one thing - stretching the over-allocated Colorado River - that stuck in the minds of Arizona water managers.", "When drought struck the river in the early years of this decade, lowering reservoir storage by half, state officials brought up the idea of restarting the desalination plant.", "To meet the Mexican treaty terms without the desalter, the bureau had been drawing water from Lake Mead at the rate of about 100,000 acre-feet a year, more than 32 billion gallons.", "From the day the plant stopped running in 1992, water continued to flow over the border down the delivery channels, which meant, on paper, Mexico was receiving more than its share of river water.", "The solution, Arizona officials argued, was clear: Turn the desalter back on.", "That is when the birds flew into the picture.", "The conflict All that water flowing past the desalter into Sonora didn't just vanish into the desert.", "It collected in a geological depression formed by a branch of the San Andreas Fault and revived a wetland that had nearly dried up.", "Inside of a decade, the marshy area grew from a few hundred acres, derisively called the Santa Clara Slough, to the 40,000-acre Cienega de Santa Clara, a wetland that harbors some of the rarest species in the hemisphere.", "\"It's the most biologically significant wetland in the Sonoran Desert,\" said Karl Flessa, a University of Arizona geosciences professor.", "\"It is a remnant wetland of what was once an enormous complex of wetlands that were either converted to ag land or have simply dried up.", "The idea here is we better hang on to what we've got.", "It's the last stand for wetlands on the Mexican side.", "\" Conservation groups rallied against restarting the desalter because, as designed, it would take most of the water feeding the wetland and return only the sludge left from the desalination process.", "Environmentalists attacked the desalter as a waste of money, a white elephant that would trample a delicate slice of desert life.", "For many activists the wetland also helped support arguments for restoring water to the larger Colorado River Delta, a 1.9 million acre expanse from the U.S.-Mexican border to the Gulf of California, the river's historic endpoint.", "The river rarely reaches the delta anymore, its flow sucked dry by dams, canals and other diversion points along its final miles.", "The Santa Clara offered on-the-ground proof that a little water could help revive the delta.", "\"One of the reasons the delta is so interesting is that simply adding water will get you a quick response,\" said Michael Cohen, a senior researcher at the Pacific Institute, an environmental research group.", "\"In the early 1990s, floods flowed through the river and the cottonwoods and willows came back.", "It happened naturally, not because some manager decided to release water.", "\" The solution Which brings us to the campfire along the Colorado River in the bottom of the Grand Canyon.", "In the spring of 2004, Bennett Raley, then a deputy Interior secretary, took a group of water managers, environmentalists and journalists on a rafting trip on the Colorado, hoping to spark conversations about the river's future.", "Among the rafters were Pitt, the Environmental Defense analyst who wanted the desalter kept silent, and Sid Wilson, general manager of the Central Arizona Project, who was leading the charge to restart the plant.", "Pitt had recently signed a letter to Gov.", "Janet Napolitano, asking her to block the desalter's operation, and everyone on the trip knew it.", "For Wilson, the issue was basic: In the event of a shortage on the Colorado, the CAP canal, which delivers river water to Phoenix and Tucson, takes the first and biggest hit.", "Anything to keep water in Lake Mead could forestall a shortage.", "\"When we started talking about it, the U.S. position was that it cost too much,\" Wilson said.", "\"The governor had letters from the environmental organizations opposing it.", "Pitt and Wilson continued talking after the trip, and inside of a few months, they hatched an idea to organize a working study group.", "That group produced a plan to operate the desalter in a way that could still protect the Cienega de Santa Clara.", "\"I'd invested a lot of energy in simply trying to tell the world what a problem the plant would be,\" Pitt said.", "\"That didn't put me in a space where it made sense to think about how it could operate without harming the cienega.", "\" The group proposed a series of ideas, most based on finding other water sources to meet the treaty terms and still support the wetlands.", "The other sources could include groundwater or runoff from other farm fields.", "The group also proposed expanding the mission of the plant so it could offer the desalted water to communities in short supply.", "Both water managers and environmental groups see a broader picture in this debate.", "Arizona considers the plant critical to the success of a seven-state Colorado River drought plan, a document that relies on augmenting the river's flow.", "Conservationists say the Santa Clara's continued health will boost efforts to restore wider swaths of the river delta.", "\"A little bit of water goes a long way,\" UA's Flessa said.", "\"The whole Colorado River is a story of using and reusing water.", "This is an example of where at the grass-roots level, these agencies and the other groups got together and said, 'Let's see what we can do.", "' And with a remarkably small amount of money, they got this thing going.", "I think

Colorado River, a key water source for several western states, according to a report released Wednesday.", "The study, prepared by a National Research Council committee, paints a sobering picture as the water needs of a rapidly expanding population test the limits of a river system strained by the effects of climate change.", "``The basin is going to face increasingly costly, controversial and unavoidable trade-off choices,'' said Ernest Smerdon, who chaired the panel of academicians and scientists who wrote the report.", "``Increasing demands are impeding the region's ability to cope with droughts and water shortages.", "'' Such measures as conservation, desalination and water recycling would be helpful, the authors said, but wouldn't offer a panacea.", "The report, which examined climate modeling and tree ring data, reaffirms a more pessimistic assessment of river hydrology that has emerged in recent years.", "Scientists have concluded that the Colorado river system, which supplies water to 25 million people and several million acres of crop and ranch land, has been drier and more prone to severe drought than was the case in the early 20th century, when the river's flows were divvied among the seven basin states.", "It turns out that period was unusually wet, prompting an overly generous estimate of how much water would be available to farms and cities.", "Ancient tree rings, which provide graphic evidence of past precipitation patterns, indicate it had been three centuries since the basin was last awash with that much water.", "The most recent drought began in 2000 and has left the river's biggest reservoirs, Lake Mead and Lake Powell, roughly half empty.", "``Now that is not a happy picture,'' Smerdon said.", "``What we want people to do is to be aware of these scientific facts and take them into account as they plan for development, for drought-contingency plans.", "'' Global warming will only make matters worse, said Connie Woodhouse, a University of Arizona associate professor of geography who helped write the report.", "``It's going to enhance the droughts'' that are part of the natural climate cycle.", "Although the river's flows returned to normal in 2005 after five years of dramatic lows, they fell again last year.", "Federal scientists say that if they remain below average or even average, Lake Mead might never completely refill.", "The study, which was sponsored by the National Academies, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation and several water agencies, notes that temperatures have risen in the western United States over the past century and are expected to keep climbing.", "``All of the models are predicting very significant warming in the future,'' said Smerdon, a former engineering college dean at the University of Arizona in Tucson.", "The report acknowledges some uncertainty over whether climate change would alter the amount of precipitation in the basin.", "But as the mercury rises, water demands would increase.", "There would be more evaporation from croplands and reservoirs, and wild land vegetation would suck more moisture from the soil, reducing runoff.", "``I think a reasonably savvy person would have to say you're going to see less water in that river,'' said Brad Udall, director of Western Water Assessment at the University of Colorado in Boulder, who was not a member of the report committee.", "``The real question is how much less.", "Is it 5 percent less or is it 40 percent less and by when?", "'' The U.S. Department of Interior, which oversees the Colorado's management, is reviewing a drought plan the states put together last year.", "Because California holds some of the most senior rights to the river, Arizona, Nevada and Mexico would experience cuts in deliveries before California, said Roger Patterson, assistant general manager of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California.", "The river is a major source for Metropolitan, Southern California's major urban water supplier.", "Last year about 30 percent of the agency's water deliveries came from the Colorado, which provides about 10 percent of California's overall urban and agricultural supplies.", "Most of the state's river allotment -- the biggest in the system -- goes to the Imperial Irrigation District, which distributes water to the croplands of the Imperial Valley, one of the nation's biggest lettuce producers.", "Noting that farms remain the dominant water user in the Colorado basin, the report called agricultural water ``the most important and perhaps final large reservoir of available water for urban use in the arid U.S.", "'' But that supply is also finite, the authors emphasized, and shifting water from farm to city could have negative impacts.", "Transfers could hurt rural economies, lower food production and rob wildlife of leaking irrigation water that nourishes important habitat."]}, {"headline": "WESTERN STATES EXPAND THEIR QUEST FOR WATER RANDY

research hydrologist at the U.S. Geological Survey who studies the relationships between water and climate.", "Dettinger said warmer temperatures have pushed the spring snowmelt and runoff to about 10

reservoirs and diverted to farms and cities from Las Vegas to Mexicali, Mexico.", "For more than a decade, conservation groups in the U.S. and Mexico have tried unsuccessfully to restore North America's largest desert estuary.", "Now the Sonoran Institute is warning that unless restoration is undertaken before a prolonged dry spell, which many scientists are predicting, it could be too late.", "In its forthcoming analysis of the delta, the nonprofit Arizona institute paints a dire picture of the once-vibrant ecosystem.", "But it also puts forth a proposal for replenishing much of the area by replacing a fraction of the river water that once flowed through the delta, saying it would be enough to restore much of the area's natural wealth.", "Under the institute's plan, the delta would get about three-tenths of a percent of the river's historic annual flow, making it one of the more modest claims on a river that serves 30 million people.", "But even that amount could be a hard sell.", "Eight years of drought in the Colorado watershed have raised the likelihood of shortages in the near future, and as officials in the U.S. and Mexico look for creative ways of limiting future cutbacks, every drop will count.", "The river's annual flow has fallen as low as 25 percent of normal since 2000, and some scientists have predicted that with the growing influence of climate change, flows will average 50 percent to 60 percent of normal over the next 50 years.", "Later this year, Interior Secretary Dick Kempthorne is expected to announce the first-ever guidelines for managing reduced water deliveries from the Colorado in the event of shortages.", "Officials say a shortage will be declared when the water level at Lake Mead drops 36 feet below its current level, a change that is expected within the next few years.", "As the government draws up plans for dealing with a reduced water supply, environmentalists believe restoration must be made a priority or the delta will be doomed.", "\"If we fail right now, we might really fail, as the shortage becomes a reality and discussions about saving water for conservation become a lot harder,\" said Jennifer Pitt, a policy analyst with the group Environmental Defense, which works closely with the Sonoran Institute.", "Advocates for the delta have little legal leverage.", "Neither the 1944 treaty that allocates Colorado River water to Mexico nor any environmental law in that country mandates water for the delta.", "Late last year, in support of efforts by California to reclaim water that has been seeping across the border and nourishing crops and wetlands in the delta, Congress passed legislation barring the use of U.S. environmental laws to protect Mexico's interests.", "But the Sonoran Institute contends that there is still nearly enough unclaimed water in the river to revive the delta without impinging on any existing rights on either side of the border.", "\"What we are talking about is the slop, leakage and waste discharges, \" said Peter Culp, a lawyer who represents the institute.", "It's the water that slips past Mexico's Morelos Dam after an upriver storm or that trickles back to the river from irrigated fields.", "For 30 years, the crown jewel of the delta's remaining wetlands, the 40,000-acre Cienega de Santa Clara in Sonora, Mexico, has relied entirely on brackish discharges from a nearby irrigation district.", "The problem with such releases, however, is that they can't be counted on forever and don't always occur when nature needs them.", "To ensure timely flows, the institute has proposed amending the 1944 treaty to allow Mexico to bank water in the U.S. and participate in a bi-national water market.", "\"There are significant human benefits to the proposal,\" said Mark Lellouch, one of its authors.", "About 200,000 people live in scattered communities in the delta, Lellouch said, and restoration would provide more sustenance and more jobs.", "Even now, nature tourism is a going concern.", "Visitors from the U.S. and Mexico are drawn to the Cienega de Santa Clara and other destinations by the estimated 350,000 birds that still nest and feed in the delta.", "\"There are a number of stakeholders in Mexico interested in that environment,\" said Steve Smullen, principal engineer for the International Boundary and Water Commission, the agency that

Colorado River, the lifeline for several Western states, federal officials have reached a new pact with the states on how to allocate water if the river runs short.", "State and federal officials praised the agreement, which Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne was expected to sign Thursday, as a landmark akin to the Colorado River Compact of 1922 that first divvied up how much water the seven states served by the river -- California, Nevada, Arizona, Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, and Wyoming -- receive annually.", "The new accord, outlined by federal officials in a telephone news conference Friday, spells out how three down-river states, California, Arizona and Nevada, will share the pain of river shortages.", "It puts in place new measures to encourage conservation and manage the two primary reservoirs, Lake Mead and Lake Powell, which have gone from nearly full to just about half empty since 1999.", "The accord is expected to forestall litigation that was likely to have arisen as fast-growing states jockey for the best way to keep the water flowing to their residents and businesses in increasingly dry times.", "It would be in effect through 2026 and could be revised during that time.", "Some environmental groups said the pact did not go far enough to encourage conservation and discourage growth.", "But federal officials said they took the best of several proposals by the states, environmental organizations and others and emphasized the importance of all seven states agreeing with the result.", "\"I think for the first time in 85 years we are on the same page,\" said Herb Guenther, the director of water resources in Arizona, which had initially balked at some terms of the agreement and was threatening legal action over it.", "But with water levels in reservoirs dropping, a record eight-year drought, the prospect that climate change could bring more dry spells and new scientific analyses suggesting the West could be drier than has been traditionally believed, the states were pushed to act.", "These factors \"forced the issue to the head and we decided to do something unique and different,\" Guenther said.", "The agreement, the product of two-and-a-half years of negotiation and study, establishes criteria for the Interior Department to declare a shortage on the river, which would occur when the system is unable to produce the 7.5 million acre-feet of water, enough to supply 15 million homes for a year, that the three down river states are entitled to.", "Water deliveries would be decreased based on how far water levels drop in Lake Mead and Lake Powell.", "The Bureau of Reclamation, which manages the river system, predicts about a 5 percent chance of such a shortage being declared by 2010, but it all depends on how much the states are able to conserve and, of course, the weather.", "The probability projection \"does not imply it can't happen,\" said Terry Fulp, a bureau official involved in managing the river.", "Water districts, anticipating an eventual cutback of Colorado River water, have been storing large amounts of water and the accord encourages them to continue to do so.", "The pact includes a bundle of agreements with the states, including approval for water managers in the Las Vegas area, which gets 90 percent of its water from the Colorado, to get a greater share of Lake Mead water in exchange for financing a reservoir in California to capture large amounts of river water destined for Mexico but beyond that country's entitlement by treaty.", "\"It's hugely important for us,\" said Scott Huntley, a spokesman for the Southern Nevada Water Authority.", "\"This really does provide the bridge for us to get into the next decade.", "\" But John Weisheit, conservation director for Living Rivers, a Utah-based environmental group, said the agreement sends the message to the states that growth trumps sensible water management.", "Weisheit said the conservation should have been stressed and the government's computer modeling was overly optimistic about future water supply.", "\"There is more water on paper than there actually is on the landscape,\" he said.", "\"They are looking at this in a way that will allow more development even though the water is not theoretically there."]}, {"headline": "Government Adopts Colorado River Guidelines", "id": "LTW_ENG_20071214.0121",

Dolan said more bodies were in the water.", "As many as 30 people were reported missing, and the rescue effort had shifted to recovery.", "Hospital officials said 79 people were injured.", "A strong current and low visibility hampered the search, and divers were pulled out of the water Thursday afternoon so it could be lowered, said Inspector Jeff Storms of the sheriff's department.", "Twelve vehicles had been located in the river, officials said.", "\"We have a number of vehicles that are underneath big pieces of concrete, and we do know we have some people in those vehicles,\" Dolan

hour.", "Dozens of cars plummeted more than 60 feet (18 meters) into the Mississippi River, some falling on top one of another.", "A school bus sat on the angled concrete.", "The bridge was Minnesota's busiest, and carried approximately 141,000 vehicles per day.", "President George W. Bush, who will travel to the scene of the disaster on Saturday, said the federal government would help rebuild the bridge in the city that will host next year's Republican National Convention.", "\"We in the federal government must respond, and respond robustly, to help the people there not only recover, but to make sure that lifeline of activity -- that bridge -- gets rebuilt as quickly as possible,\" Bush said.", "Still stung by harsh criticism of the government's sluggish response to Hurricane Katrina, Bush talked with state and local officials in Minnesota, and the administration dispatched officials to the scene.", "First lady Laura Bush will visit Minneapolis on Friday to console victims of the disaster.", "The U.S. House Transportation Committee quickly approved legislation Thursday that would direct $250 million (euro183 million) to Minnesota to help it replace the bridge.", "But in the Senate, Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Democrat, said it was too soon to approve emergency funding for a new bridge because it is unclear how much will be needed.", "Congress recesses for its August vacation on Friday.", "The White House said a U.S. inspection of the 40-year-old

unsafe,\" Transportation Secretary Mary Peters said.", "Earlier, at the White House, press secretary Tony Snow said while the inspection did not indicate the bridge was at risk of failing, \"If an inspection report identifies deficiencies, the state is responsible for taking corrective actions.", "Tim Pawlenty on Thursday ordered an immediate inspection of all bridges in the state with similar designs, but said the state was never warned that the bridge needed to be closed or immediately repaired.", "Another inspection was scheduled for completion in September.", "\"There was no call by anyone that we're aware of that said it should be immediately closed or immediately replaced,\" Pawlenty said.", "\"It was more of a monitor, inspect, maintain, and potentially replace it in the future.", "\" Later Thursday, officials alerted states to immediately inspect all steel-deck truss bridges similar to the one that collapsed in Minneapolis bridge.", "There are approximately 700 such spans, according to U.S. Transportation Department spokesman Brian Turmail.", "Governors across America scrambled Thursday to conduct bridge inspections, ordering engineers to review the safety of thousands of structures.", "Nearly 13 percent of America's bridges were classified as \"structurally deficient\" in 2004, meaning they are deteriorating, according to a report issued by the Federal Highway Administration.", "That was 75,422 bridges out of about 600,000 nationwide.", "In the Mississippi River, divers took down license plate numbers for authorities to track down the vehicles' owners.", "Getting the vehicles out was expected to take several days and involve moving around very large, heavy pieces of bridge.", "Relatives who could not find their loved ones at hospitals gathered in a hotel ballroom Thursday for any news, hoping for the best.", "As many as 50 vehicles tumbled into the river when the bridge collapsed, leaving those who could escape to scramble to shore.", "Some survivors carried the injured up the riverbank, while emergency workers tended to others on the ground and some jumped into the water to look for survivors.", "Fire and black smoke rose from the wreckage.", "\"People who were pinned or partly crushed told emergency workers to say 'hello' or say 'goodbye' to their loved ones,\" Dolan said.", "Aron Dahlgren, 23, a University of Minnesota graduate student, was driving to his girlfriend's home when the bridge began to fall.", "He noticed overhead road signs in front of him start to sink -- and then his car plummeted.", "\"That's the longest two or three seconds of your life,\" Dahlgren said.", "\"That was the scariest place.", "I kept on thinking -- I kept on questioning, was this how I was going to die.", "If I'd have left 30 seconds earlier, I'd have been over the water.", "\" The first step of the federal investigation will be to recover pieces of the bridge and reassemble them, much like a jigsaw puzzle, to try and determine what happened, NTSB Chairman Mark Rosenker said.", "Investigators also want to review video of the collapse.", "Engineers spotted structural problems in the bridge as far back as 1990, but state officials thought patches and yearly inspections would be enough to keep it together, Minnesota's top bridge engineer said.", "This year's inspection started in June and would have been finished in September after $2.4 million (euro1.76 million) worth of maintenance on the deck, joints, guardrails and lights.", "\"We thought we had done all we could.", "Obviously something went

plainly: They're dangerous.", "'' After several such iterations of the threat, the Times' Rutenberg asked Bush to be philosophical about bin Laden.", "``What do you think your own reaction would have been five years ago had you been told that toward the end of your term he would still be at large with that kind of capability, from Iraq no less?", "'' The answer went back to another restatement of the threat.", "``We are under threat,'' the president said.", "``Now some may say, `Well, he's just saying that, you know, to get people to pay attention to him, or try to scare them for some

a valedictory visit to Iraq, the country that will largely define his legacy, but the trip will more likely be remembered for the unscripted moment when an Iraqi journalist hurled his shoes at Bush's head and denounced him on live television as a \"dog\" who had delivered death and sorrow here from nearly six years of war.", "The drama unfolded shortly after Bush appeared at a news conference in Baghdad with Prime Minister Nouri Kamal al-Maliki to highlight the newly adopted security agreement between the United States and Iraq.", "That agreement includes a commitment to withdraw all American forces by the end of 2011.", "The Iraqi journalist, Muntader al-Zaidi, 28, a correspondent for Al Baghdadia, an independent Iraqi station, stood up about 12 feet from Bush and shouted in Arabic: \"This is a gift from the Iraqis; this is the farewell kiss, you dog!", "\" He then threw a shoe at Bush, who ducked and narrowly avoided it.", "As stunned security agents and guards, officials and journalists watched, al-Zaidi then threw his other shoe, shouting in Arabic, \"This is from the widows, the orphans and those who were killed in Iraq!", "\" That shoe also narrowly missed Bush as al-Maliki stuck a hand in front of the president's face to help shield him.", "Chaos immediately ensued as a scrum of al-Maliki's security agents jumped on the man, wrestled him to the floor and hustled him out of the ornate room where the news conference was taking place.", "They kicked him and beat him until \"he was crying like a woman,\" said Mohammed Taher, a reporter for Afaq, a station owned by the Dawa Party, which is led by al-Maliki.", "Zaidi was then detained on unspecified charges.", "Other Iraqi journalists in the front row of the news conference publicly apologized to Bush, who was uninjured and tried to brush off the incident by making a joke.", "\"All I can report is it is a size 10,\" he said, continuing to take a few questions and noting the apologies.", "He also called the incident a sign of democracy in the country, saying, \"That's what people do in a free society, draw attention to themselves,\" as the man's screaming could be heard outside.", "But the moment clearly unnerved the aides of al-Maliki and some of the Americans in Bush's entourage, partly because it was televised and may have revealed a security lapse in the so-called Green Zone, the most heavily secured part of Baghdad.", "Dana Perino, the White press secretary, was visibly distraught, and NBC News reported she had been struck in the face by a microphone in the chaos.", "The shoe-throwing incident also punctuated Bush's visit -- his fourth -- in a deeply symbolic way, reflecting the conflicted views in Iraq of a man who had toppled Saddam Hussein, ordered the occupation of the country and brought it the kind of freedoms unthinkable under Saddam's rule but at enormous costs.", "Hitting someone with a shoe is considered the supreme insult in Iraq.", "It means that the target is even lower than the shoe, which is always on the ground and dirty.", "Crowds of people hurled their shoes at the giant statue of Saddam that once stood in Baghad's Firdos Square before helping U.S. Marines to pull it down April 9, 2003, the day the capital fell.", "More recently, a far bigger crowd comprised of Iraqis who had opposed the security agreement did the same with an effigy of Bush in the same square, flinging their shoes at it before burning it.", "Al-Zaidi's motivations in carrying out a potentially career-ending act were unclear, but friends described him as a devoted journalist.", "\"He was committed to his job and after training in Lebanon became chief of correspondents about a month ago,\" said Haider Nassar, who worked with him at Baghdadia.", "\"He had bad feelings about the coalition forces,\" said Nassar, referring to the U.S.-led foreign military forces in Iraq.", "Nassar also said al-Zaidi had asked to cover the news conference, since he was the chief correspondent.", "Another friend said al-Zaidi often ended his reports by saying \"Reporting from occupied Baghdad, this is Muntader al-Zaidi.", "\" Like many Iraqi reporters at the news conference, Nassar said he did not think this was an effective way for al-Zaidi to make his points.", "\"This is so silly; it's just the behavior of an individual.", "He destroyed his future,\" he said.", "The television channel broadcast a request for al-Zaidi's release in the name of democracy and freedom of speech.", "\"Any procedure against Muntader will remind us of the behavior of the dictatorship and their violent actions, random detentions and mass graves,\" the channel said.", "\"Baghdadia TV channel also demands that the international and Iraqi television organizations cooperate in seeking the release of Muntader al-Zaidi.", "\" Shortly before 10 p.m., Bush left the Green Zone by helicopter to Camp Victory, where he was greeted with cheers and whoops from hundreds of troops inside the enormous rotunda of the Al Faw palace.", "Speaking at a lectern beneath an enormous American flag that nearly reached the domed ceiling, he praised this generation of soldiers and reflected on the sacrifice of those who had died.", "He called the increased deployment of U.S. troops in Iraq last year, a strategy known as the surge, which is credited with helping reduce violence here, \"one of the greatest successes in the history of the United States military.", "\" Bush's arrival in Iraq during daylight hours had been one measure of progress; his first visit on Thanksgiving Day 2003 took place entirely at night.", "As with previous visits -- in November 2003, June 2006 and September 2007 -- preparations for the visit were secretive and carried out with ruse.", "The White House schedule for Sunday had Bush attending the \"Christmas in Washington\" performance at the National Building Museum in downtown Washington.", "Instead, he left the White House by car Saturday night, arriving at Andrews Air Force base at 9 p.m. to board Air Force One.", "A dozen journalists accompanying him were only told of the trip Friday and allowed to tell only a superior and a spouse -- and only in person.", "At his news conference with al-Maliki, Bush described the security agreement as a landmark, signaling a new era in the war he began in the spring of 2003.", "\"There is still more work to be done,\" the president said about the war, but with the security agreement and the \"the courage of the Iraqi people, and the Iraqi troops and the American troops and civilian personnel, it is decisively on its way to be won.", "\" Al-Maliki's partnership with Bush and his backing of the security agreement are unlikely to help him much once Bush leaves office.", "Although a majority of the Iraqi parliament approved the agreement, on the street, Iraqis have mixed views.", "Many distrust any agreement made with an occupying power and while Bush is appreciated for having

blood mean the heart is working too hard.", "Common heart disease drug therapies such as ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, and diuretics can decrease the levels, making BNP and NT-proBNP effective markers for cardiac conditions.", "Until now, however, doctors have limited the test's use to confirmation of heart failure, a progressive illness in which the heart can no longer efficiently pump blood to other organs and muscles.", "A patient who comes into the emergency room with shortness of breath, for example, may be given the test to rule out other causes of the symptom, such as asthma.", "Bibbins-Domingo and her colleagues wondered whether the test also could be used to determine the long-term prognosis of patients with a history of heart problems.", "\"So we studied 1,000 people who already had heart disease, and we were interested in determining whether we could predict who would go on to have another heart attack, stroke, heart failure, or die,\" she said.", "After four years they found that the higher the level of the peptide in the blood at the outset, the higher their chances were for having an adverse cardiac event.", "For example, patients whose heart peptide levels put them in the top quarter of those tested, had a nearly 8-fold increased rate of cardiovascular events or death compared with those whose peptide levels were lowest.", "The most

catheterization laboratory at Sutter Medical Center.", "That test, which uses sonography, measures the ejection fraction, or the percentage of blood squeezed out by the heart each time it beats.", "The lower the percentage, the higher the risk of death, he explained.", "\"The (peptide test) properly identified people at high risk for dying, even with ejection fraction was OK,\" he said.", "\"That is a surprise.", "\" Roberts said he would put the peptide test in the same category as calcium scoring, a cardiac testing approach that uses an X-ray to determine the amount of calcium buildup on artery walls.", "\"This gives us more markers to help identify high-risk individuals,\" he said.", "\"If it is high, you better take a close look at that person and maybe do some more testing.", "\" Study authors emphasized, however, that the test should not replace others used to determine cardiac risks and that it will not likely be used routinely until additional research is done.", "Specifically, Bibbins-Domingo said, researchers need to determine whether the assessment tool can lead to better, more appropriate therapies and ultimately improved outcomes for patients.", "The heart peptide test might help decide, for example, whether a patient needs coronary artery bypass surgery, considered a highly effective, but risky approach to cardiovascular disease.", "\"This might be a way to help inform the discussion between a doctor and patient about whether their risk of developing another heart attack or failure in the future is so high that they are willing to undergo an intervention like a bypass surgery,\" she said."]}, {"headline": "Heart disease: chromosomes show the long and the short of it ATTENTION - EMBARGO, RELEASABLE Friday at 0001 GMT ///", "id":

moderately raised cholesterol and from 1058 control subjects, and compared the telomere lengths in their white blood cells.", "The researchers eventually found both patients and controls with the shortest telomeres were twice as likely to have developed serious heart disease, They also found that statins, which are better known for their cholesterol- lowering properties, appeared to alleviate the effects of telomere damage and may even protect telomeres against degradation.", "But the protective effect of statins was only seen in patients with comparatively short telomeres.", "\"In patients whose telomeres were wearing away at a normal rate, statin treatment didn't make any difference.", "This suggests that statins were protecting against the worst cases of telomere degradation.", "Without statins they might have been even shorter,\" Leicester University cardiologist Nilesh Samani, who led the research, was quoted as saying.", "For years, doctors and scientists have suspected that another property of statins, unrelated to their cholesterol-lowering ability, explained how they protected patients from heart disease and stroke so effectively.", "The discoveries made by Samani's team provide important new insights into the causes of arterial disease.", "Samani said exactly how statins might limit the damage caused by telomere shortening or even directly protect telomeres was \" speculation at this stage,\" but his group has already begun laboratory studies to test how the drugs interact with telomeres."]}, {"headline": "Update on Major Health

Jan. 26, 2005, came seconds after he noticed an odd reflection on the tracks, about a quarter mile dead ahead.", "As his train with three passenger cars zoomed straight for the reflection at nearly 80 mph, he soon realized it was coming from an SUV straddling the tracks.", "\"He ran down the aisle and told people to 'Hold on!", "\"' Deputy District Attorney John Monaghan told jurors Monday in opening remarks at the trial for the Metrolink train crash in Glendale, in which 11 passengers and crew died.", "About 180 other people were injured.", "Prosecutors portrayed Juan Manuel Alvarez, the man accused of murder, as an egomaniac meth user who wanted to kill people as a way to get attention from his estranged wife.", "Playing a slide show featuring photos of the victims when they were alive, followed by shots of their bodies in the wreckage, Los Angeles County prosecutors said there is no doubt that Alvarez is guilty of murder for dousing his SUV with gasoline, leaving it on railroad tracks in Glendale and watching the carnage unfold.", "\"On that day, Mr. Alvarez murdered 11 people,\" Monaghan said.", "The defense argued that Alvarez's only intent that morning was to kill himself.", "While he's responsible for setting off a \"perfect storm\" of escalating events that resulted in the death of 11 people, that doesn't make him a murderer, said Thomas Kielty, Alvarez's defense lawyer.", "\"Juan Alvarez was looking for a place to light himself on fire,\" said Kielty about the reason Alvarez initially drove his Jeep south, well past the legal traffic barrier at the train crossing at Chevy Chase Drive, between Los Angeles and Glendale.", "He then decided that getting hit by a train would be a more efficient way to kill himself, his attorney said.", "\"Juan Alvarez never imagined that a train would derail or that anybody would die other than himself,\" Kielty said.", "Alvarez, 29, with shorter hair and a goatee, wore a cream-color suit at the opening of his trial.", "He is charged with 11 counts of murder and one count of arson and train wrecking, along with special-circumstance allegations of multiple murders and train wrecking stemming from the crash.", "About 6 a.m. on Jan. 26, 2005, Metrolink train 100, heading southbound, smashed into Alvarez's SUV before derailing and hitting two more trains, including the northbound Metrolink 901.", "\"Don't let me burn!", "don't let me burn!", "\" Monaghan said passengers on board the trains screamed in the fiery aftermath.", "\"The evidence will clearly show beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Alvarez is the individual that parked a jeep that had been doused with gasoline on the southbound tracks.", "\" Alvarez's methamphetamine use was so bad and he was so delusional that he thought the CIA was following him and that his wife had a slew of lovers, including one who secretly slept with the couple in their bed, prompting Alvarez to sleep with a knife, Kielty said.", "After a series of incidents and suicide or \"pretend-suicide\" attempts, as the prosecutors called them -- such as when Alvarez inflicted wounds on himself or took pills -- his wife kicked him out of their home.", "She got a restraining order in late 2004 to keep him away from her, their children, as well as his mother and brother, whom Alvarez allegedly threatened to kill.", "The defense contends that after hearing the voices of his estranged wife and \"her lover\" calling him stupid, coming from the back seat of his dark-green Jeep Cherokee, Alvarez, who was on his way to work at about 5:30 a.m., decided to kill himself.", "He filled up two water bottles with gasoline and went to look for a place to light himself on fire.", "But prosecutors said they believe the evidence will show that Alvarez didn't intend to kill himself, just others.", "\"Mr. Alvarez used Metrolink 100 as a match to light his vehicle on fire,\" Monaghan said.", "Cathryn Brogham, deputy district attorney, said Alvarez's actions that day were part of a consistent pattern in which he tried to get his estranged wife's attention, this time by killing people.", "\"He could have simply walked in front of that train,\" Brogham said.", "\"He didn't just go jump off a bridge.", "He did not go drive his vehicle off a mountain.", "\" The defense claims that Alvarez changed his mind about the suicide and tried unsuccessfully to back the jeep off the tracks, but the vehicle was stuck.", "For Henry Romero, whose uncle Leonardo Romero was killed in the crash, there's nothing the defense can say to convince him of Alvarez's innocence.", "\"Blatant murder is what I think it is,\" Romero said.", "The family is involved in a lawsuit against the Metrolink, saying that the push method used to propel the Metrolink 100 -- where the engine is behind the passenger cars -- was unsafe.", "Metrolink is fighting the suit on the grounds that the federal government certified the push-pull method as safe.", "And in 2006, a Federal Railroad Administration report found there was not enough evidence to justify always having a locomotive out front, and Metrolink says it would be impractical and expensive."]}, {"headline": "Murder

Wednesday during cross-examination in his murder trial.", "Deputy District Attorney John Monaghan pounded Juan Manuel Alvarez for details about threats he admitted making to kill or injure his then-estranged wife, his cousin and others before he parked his SUV on railroad tracks in Glendale, causing the Jan. 26, 2005, collision.", "\"So you were mad,\" Monaghan said.", "\"So you said you were going to kill somebody, is that what you're telling this jury?", "\" Alvarez shot back that it appeared that Monaghan was trying to say he intended to kill people on the train, which he denies.", "Alvarez, 29, faces 11 counts of murder, one count each of train wrecking and arson, as well as special-circumstance allegations of multiple murder and train wrecking.", "If convicted, he could face the death penalty.", "The prosecution's cross-examination is scheduled to continue this morning.", "During his second day of testimony in Los Angeles Superior Court, Alvarez said he was in good spirits when he woke up that January morning, even taking time to water his landlord's roses before driving off for a meeting about a job.", "Alvarez was an admitted methamphetamine user at the time of the crash, although he testified that it had been three or four days since he had used the drug, even though he initially told a doctor it had been longer because he was ashamed and afraid it would make him look bad.", "That morning, Alvarez, a man who defense witnesses have testified hallucinated that his wife's phantom lover slept in their bed and could fly, thought his wife and her lover were in the back seat of his vehicle, mocking him.", "Under earlier questioning Tuesday from defense attorney Thomas Kielty, Alvarez said that's when he decided to douse himself with gasoline and kill himself.", "He said he ditched that plan because he thought it would be \"too painful,\" and decided to kill himself by parking his SUV on the train tracks instead.", "But he changed his mind again, he testified Tuesday, and wanted to live for his children, but couldn't get the stuck SUV off the tracks.", "Wednesday, he admitted to Monaghan that he has repeatedly lied to people, and the prosecutor noted that in recent months, Alvarez told a doctor he thought that January morning about killing his wife at work \"and everybody else.", "\" \"I probably meant everybody else that was spying on me, the people that were following me,\" he said.", "The day began with Kielty continuing his direct examination, in which Alvarez admitted that while in custody, he has illegally stored razor blades, sold prescription medicine and made a batch of \"pruno\" -- a homemade alcoholic brew.", "Alvarez also admitted passing a friend heroin that had been smuggled in by a new inmate, as well as using extortion and threats against another inmate, a man he said was in custody for child molestation.", "In his questioning, Kielty pointed out that Alvarez had been recorded in jail saying he was drug-free and didn't intend on using drugs, in part, because they caused him to hallucinate and \"get crazy.", "\" \"I think I'm better now and I'm afraid to take anything,\" Alvarez said.", "But just Wednesday morning, Alvarez took anti-depression medication, he admitted under cross-examination.", "And Monaghan highlighted Alvarez's jailhouse problems as proof that he hasn't changed, quoting from a recorded phone conversation in which Alvarez told someone he extorted two $10.75 phone cards and a bag of coffee from another inmate under threats of harm.", "\"Didn't you tell this inmate if he didn't pay you, he would get 'f----- up,'?", "\"Are you still dangerous?", "\" Alvarez's response: \"I don't consider myself dangerous."]}, {"headline": "PROSECUTORS SEEK DEATH PENALTY IN TRAIN

brought to tears as the prosecution pushed its case forward.", "\"Life without parole is not justice for the 11 victims,\" Deputy District Attorney Cathryn Brougham told the nine women and three men who will decide Alvarez's fate.", "As prosecutors continued, the jury could hear the sobs and wails of relatives of Leonardo Romero of Newport Beach.", "Romero, 53, was one of the 11 killed when Alvarez drove his SUV onto the tracks in Glendale on Jan. 26, 2005, causing a disaster in which a Metrolink train derailed and smashed into another commuter train.", "When prosecutors showed a photograph of Romero -- a former Marine and father of three, taken shortly after his death -- the family was overcome with emotion.", "One juror wiped tears streaming down her cheeks with a tissue and calmed herself by cooling her face with an Asian-style fan.", "Alvarez, 29, sitting dispassionately next to his attorneys, looked at the witnesses during their testimony and occasionally glanced at the photographs that prosecutors displayed on a large screen hanging from a wall in the courtroom.", "The jury appeared equally moved later when prosecutors presented their first two witnesses -- the mother and younger brother of James Tutino, 47, a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy who was among the victims.", "Maureen Tutino narrated a slide show of her family's photographs that prosecutor John Monaghan presented to jurors, showing the central role James Tutino had occupied in the lives of his loved ones and the void his death had created.", "\"He was kind of the sunshine of our life,\" said an emotionally wrought Maureen Tutino, \"and we miss that.", "\" Tutino said one of James' sons, Nick, will be sworn in as a sheriff's deputy July 17 and will be given his father's badge

go say goodbye to my brother.", "\" \"Because of the injuries he suffered, I had to say my goodbyes through a coffin, and that's the most difficult thing for me.", "I'll regret that for the rest of my life.", "\" Later in the penalty phase of the trial, Alvarez's wife, Carmen, and his brother Beto are expected to ask jurors to spare his life.", "The jury is not expected to reach a verdict on whether to recommend life in prison or death for Alvarez until at least late next week.", "Alvarez was convicted June 26 of 11 counts of first-degree murder and one count of arson.", "The jury also found true the special circumstance of multiple murders, which makes Alvarez eligible for the death penalty.", "The train derailment also injured 180 people.", "Prosecutors want the jury to recommend that Alvarez be executed instead of spending the rest of his life in prison without the possibility of parole.", "\"Life without parole is not an adequate, appropriate punishment,\" Brougham told jurors.", "\"The defendant deserves the greater punishment.", "\" In her closing argument, Brougham presented profiles of each of the 11 people who died, saying family members and friends would attest to the loss and tragedy caused by their deaths.", "\"You can only begin to imagine the damage that this man has caused,\" Brougham said of the victims.", "\"Each was a unique individual with a future, with a family, with hopes, with dreams.", "\" Alvarez's attorneys deferred their argument until they begin presenting the defense case, possibly later this week.", "In addition to Alvarez family members, defense attorneys are expected to elicit testimony from psychiatrists in an attempt to portray the convicted killer in the sympathetic light of a troubled man who was abused as a child by his father and uncle.", "Possibly preparing for that, prosecutors reminded jurors that Alvarez's brother and sister had also been abused as children, but that they, like most children who have been abused, did not wind up as mass murderers.", "\"He told you himself he had homicidal thoughts that morning,\" Brougham reminded jurors about Alvarez's testimony.", "\"It's not an accident that these people were murdered by him.", "\" Alvarez, according to Brougham, had acted as a man bent on destruction with no sense of conscience about the havoc he would cause.", "Brougham also reminded jurors of testimony that while in jail, Alvarez had dealt drugs, intimidated prisoners and engaged in other behavior inconsistent with a person truly sorry for his actions.", "\"That is not a remorseful,

that she had tried, but failed, to abort her unborn son using folk-medicine brews of herbs and leaves as well as traditional medications.", "The nine women and three men on the jury will decide whether the 29-year-old Compton handyman will get the death penalty or spend the rest of his life in prison.", "The testimony of family members came on the first day of closing arguments for Alvarez's defense team.", "The sentencing phase of the trial follows his conviction last month on 11 counts of first- degree murder.", "\"Before you sentence the man, you take into account not just the offense, you take into account the man,\" court-appointed lead defense lawyer Michael Belter told jurors at the outset of his closing argument.", "Jurors did not seem as moved emotionally as they were during the prosecution's presentation of testimony from family and friends of the victims of the Jan. 26, 2005, Metrolink train derailment.", "But they were visibly gripped by the accounts of sexual molestation, beatings, emotional abuse and abject family life described by the defense and family members.", "Belter asked jurors to recommend life in prison without the possibility of parole for Alvarez, while acknowledging the gravity of his client's deadly actions that irrevocably devastated the victims' families.", "\"We are not here to offer any excuses or justifications,\" he said.",

unspeakable acts of extreme machismo and dominance over loved ones.", "From the time he was a child, Alvarez was mercilessly beaten for no apparent reason by his father, using fists, belts and electrical cords, several relatives testified.", "As children, Alvarez, his sister and others in the family were sexually molested by an uncle, relatives said on the witness stand.", "Alvarez's cousin, Otilia Guevara, testified that the same uncle raped her often, even while she visited her grandmother and with the knowledge of her grandmother and several family members.", "And in the most emotional testimony of the day, Alvarez's mother spoke tearfully about being a battered wife for more than two decades at the hands of an alcoholic, drug-addicted husband whose beatings caused the miscarriage of one of her unborn children.", "And no one protested or reported the crimes.", "\"This was Mexico,\" Ayala said through a translator.", "Even after her husband abandoned her and her young daughter, Ayala said, she crossed the border from Mexico into the United States illegally on foot -- five months pregnant with Juan -- to be near the man who regularly physically abused her.", "She said she tried to abort her unborn son in Mexico prior to her U.S. journey.", "When her husband was deported, Ayala said, she followed him back to Mexico with young Juan, who had been born in the U.S.", "In Mexicali, the battering continued and it took its toll on Juan to the point that his reticence to communicate led some teachers to believe he was a deaf-mute.", "Young Alvarez, loved ones testified, was withdrawn and quiet -- possibly from the physical abuse, to which relatives said he had grown so accustomed that he no longer cried.", "\"He would never cry,\" said his mother.", "\" asked her son's lawyer.", "\" Prosecutors challenged parts of the testimony of Alvarez's family members, except for his mother, whom they chose not to cross-examine.", "Less moving were the testimony

win back when he caused the disaster in which a Metrolink train derailed and smashed into another commuter train.", "Carmen Alvarez told jurors she is now involved in another romantic relationship and plans to move on with her life.", "Moments before she took the stand, Alvarez had turned to look at her and smiled -- his only show of emotion to any of his loved ones.", "Beto Alvarez was on the stand as defense lawyers introduced a message recorded on his home answering machine just minutes after Juan caused the derailment and carnage.", "\"I didn't mean to do this, Beto,\" Juan Alvarez said in the message.", "\"A lot of innocent people died.", "I don't deserve to live, Beto.", "I apologize for everything.", "Please pray for me."]}, {"headline": "Man faces life for California train crash

2004.", "Taylor has had other run-ins with the law.", "In 1992, he received a two-year sentence in the Bronx on a drug-trafficking charge.", "He served seven months in a New York state prison before

group.", "Despite the industry's recommendation, many companies -- including such giants as Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson -- continue to sell cough and cold medicines with \"infant\" in their titles and pictures of babies on their labels.", "Mark Boston, a spokesman for a Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson subsidiary that sells pediatric cough and cold medicines, said the company \"supports the materials\" that the trade association submitted to the FDA, but declined to say why the company continues to sell such products as \"Concentrated Tylenol Infants' Drops Plus Cold.", "\" Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, Baltimore's commissioner of health and an author of a petition that led the FDA to conduct its current review, cheered its new report, saying it raised serious questions about why anyone would give cough and cold medicines to young children.", "\"These products are used by hundreds of thousands of kids every year, but no one can say that they're safe or effective,\" he said.", "The petition followed a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that found that more than 1,500 children under the age of two had suffered serious health problems between 2004 and 2005 after being treated with common cough and cold medicines.", "Current figures on the medicines' sales and use are not available, but in 1994 researchers reported in The Journal of the American Medical Association that more than a third of all three-year-olds in the United States were given over-the-counter cough and cold preparations in one 30-day span.", "The petition noted that in 1990, Americans spent nearly $2 billion on these medications, and it said that in a typical drugstore, over 30 separate cough and cold preparations are marketed to parents for use in children.", "Also on Friday, the FDA warned the makers of nearly 200 unapproved prescription medicines containing the pain-and-cough-relief drug hydrocodone that by Oct. 31 they must stop making these products for children under six.", "Makers of all other unapproved hydrocodone products have until Dec. 31 to stop making them.", "Hydrocodone is a narcotic that is widely used to treat pain and suppress cough.", "There are seven FDA-approved prescription cough products containing hydrocodone, and doctors can continue to write prescriptions for those.", "The agency's safety review and its decision to ban unapproved hydrocodone products both result from gradual but significant changes in the standards used for drug approvals.", "In the case of pediatric over-the-counter medicines, the agency decided decades ago that drug makers could market the medicines for children even though they had only been tested in adults.", "Back then, it was assumed that children's bodies were simply smaller versions of adult ones.", "That assumption has proven untrue.", "Indeed, a growing number of studies suggest that cough and cold medicines work no better in children than placebos.", "Despite this, there are 800 such products on the market and sales have long been strong.", "Most major pharmacies carry a dozen or more brands.", "The medicines are popular largely because children have an average of six to 10 colds each year, far more than adults.", "Similarly, hydrocodone has never been shown to be safe and effective in children, and its dangers as a powerful and potentially addictive narcotic are clear.", "Even more broadly, 200 hydrocodone-containing products never won approval from the modern-day FDA.", "There are thousands of such unapproved drugs on the market.", "Indeed, an estimated 2 percent of all prescriptions are written for unapproved products.", "Most have been around for decades, and the FDA is gradually forcing their makers to either get official approval or stop selling them."]}, {"headline": "MAKERS

the ship, the captain feared it would sink.", "So to save the crew, he ran the ship aground.", "Fourteen years later, scientists from the Florida Aquarium in Tampa are still trying to repair the damage caused that night not to the freighter, but to the delicate coral reef it smashed into.", "The scientists have nursed dozens of tiny coral fragments in a lab in Ruskin, and transported them to Western Sambo Reef in the Keys.", "It's all part of a complicated experiment to find a new way to save Florida's vast coral reefs, which lately have been dying from everything from shipwrecks to pollution to climate change.", "The idea is to grow coral in labs, kind of like fish farms, so they can be returned to their natural settings in Florida's struggling coral reefs.", "Ilze Berzins of the Florida Aquarium, who is in charge of the effort, said it's more than an interesting scientific pursuit.", "Because of all the dangers facing Florida's coral reefs today, she said, doing something to restore them is urgently needed.", "\"If we can't come up with answers to our environmental problems,\" she said, \"we're not being good stewards.", "\" Coral are animals related to sea anemones and jellyfish, whose skeletons can form rocklike structures that make up reefs.", "They have tiny mouths that they can open to swallow plankton, and also get nourishment from algae in the surrounding water.", "But two species of coral last year were listed as \"threatened\" under the Endangered Species Act.", "Reefs are not only a big attraction for divers and tourists, but they also are the backbone of an ecosystem that supports a wide diversity of fish and other undersea life.", "Scientists want to protect the coral to save the surrounding environment.", "This project has its roots in a conversation about the state's coral that Berzins had with Craig Watson from the Tropical Aquaculture Laboratory in Ruskin, and an official from the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary.", "They developed a plan: Take some tiny bits of coral from a construction site in the Keys.", "Study the coral in a lab, watch it grow, make sure it's healthy.", "And then find a way to return it to the wild in hopes that it will flourish.", "A look around Berzins' office it's one of those nooks you can't see on a normal tour of the Florida Aquarium shows what makes her a good candidate to lead this effort: posters from academic conferences and pictures of seascapes, just as you would expect from a marine biologist with a doctorate.", "But her shelves also contain books with titles such as Goat Medicine and Zoo and Wild Animal Medicine.", "That's because she also is a veterinarian.", "She specializes in aquatic medicine a fish doctor, you could say.", "After obtaining government grants, she and colleagues studied the coral and developed health certificates for the tiny animals a way of determining whether they were healthy enough to be put back in the wild.", "Scientists from the University of South Florida, Florida Atlantic University and Mote Marine Laboratory in Sarasota have assisted in the research.", "Some of the tiny corals from the Keys came to the aquarium.", "Others went to Hillsborough County, to the Tropical Aquaculture Lab in Ruskin.", "This University of Florida lab works closely with the tropical fish industry, which has a large presence in Tampa Bay.", "Still others went to Mote.", "Challenging process Scientists at the Hillsborough lab went to work with equipment similar to what you might get from Lowe's or Home Depot.", "They cut the corals with a tile saw, and used epoxy to glue them onto small concrete disks.", "They monitored the different species of brain coral, boulder coral and others.", "In December, scientists went to Western Sambo Reef and used more epoxy to glue the disks in place.", "\"I like the challenge,\" said Ryan Czaja of the aquarium, who dives to place and inspect the coral.", "\"It's something I always felt, why can't it be done?", "\" Everyone in the project stressed that growing coral in \"farms\" and placing it in the wild is a complicated process that may take years to accomplish and study.", "But they have high hopes.", "\"If restoration of coral reefs is going to occur, you need corals,\" Watson said of the aquaculture lab.", "\"If we can't grow them outside of the coral reef, you're not going to get them.", "\" TED McLAREN Times photos Great star coral, or Montastrea cavernosa, at the University of Florida Tropical Aquaculture Laboratory in Ruskin is being raised in an effort to restore reefs in

pillars -- countless travelers have come nose to nose with a thriving undersea universe while on vacation.", "But increasingly, divers and snorkelers are swimming over bleached hunks of coral devastated by shore runoff or overfishing.From the South Pacific to the Caribbean, coral reefs -- which are among the most delicate of marine ecosystems -- are bearing the brunt of climate change and other human-driven activities -- including coastal development, deforestation, and unrestricted tourism.", "Now, many in the tourist industry are trying to halt the damage.", "And it is no wonder.", "The dollars involved in reef-based tourism are significant: Australia's Great Barrier Reef alone draws about 1.9 million visitors a year, supporting a $4.2 billion industry.", "According to the Nature Conservancy, the annual economic value of coral reefs to world tourism is $9.6 billion.", "Growing awareness of environmental issues means that the tourism industry has lately been a partner to conservation efforts in major reef areas.", "Though the Great Barrier is the most famous reef, it is not the most threatened; its extensive marine management program is widely regarded as a model for conservation.", "It includes eco-certification programs for tourism operators within the boundaries of the marine park, environmental tourist fees, large no-take zones, species monitoring, and tourism industry contributions to the Great Barrier Reef's main research center.", "But the world's second-largest barrier reef, the Mesoamerican Reef in the Caribbean, is seriously endangered by coastal development, runoff, and pollution.", "The reef system stretches nearly 700 miles from the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico to the Bay Islands of Honduras.", "And reefs in the Coral Triangle in Southeast Asia -- which reaches from Malaysia to the Philippines, Indonesia, and the Solomon Islands, encompassing some of the planet's most diverse marine habitats -- have been severely damaged by overfishing and destructive practices, including the use of cyanide and dynamite to capture fish.", "In 2004, the nonprofit group Conservation International began a program called the Mesoamerican Reef Tourism Initiative, which aims to address the threat that mass tourism poses to the Mesoamerican Reef by engaging hoteliers, developers, cruise lines, and local governments in Mexico, Belize, and Honduras.", "There is special emphasis on the Riviera Maya of Mexico, where, less than nine miles offshore, the island of Cozumel is the world's second most-visited cruise destination after Miami, according to the International Council of Cruise Lines.", "Last year, as part of the Mesoamerican Reef initiative's efforts, the cruise line council began an effort to avoid wastewater discharge by cruise ships in environmentally sensitive areas.", "\"This program will ensure that cruise line wastewater is discharged at least four miles from any of the sensitive marine ecosystems within the Mesoamerican Reef system, thereby minimizing the chance such discharges will have negative impact on the long-term health of the reef,\" said Jamie Sweeting, who oversees Conservation International's work with the travel industry.", "The cruise industry is a particular area of concern, since ships regularly disgorge crowds of passengers into fragile coastal areas that strain to absorb the impact.", "Conservation International estimates that cruise passengers typically make about 2,000 scuba dives in and around Cozumel's surrounding reefs in a single day.", "\"We're working with the municipal government, the local dive and water sports association, and the cruise lines themselves, because they all have a vested interest to look after this coral reef,\" Sweeting said.", "Areas being addressed include the creation of a dedicated snorkeling zone in Cozumel to limit visitor impact to one section of the reef, and ensuring that park management fees are collected and put toward protection and management of marine areas.", "The Mesoamerican Reef Tourism Initiative has also begun a program to evaluate and implement good business practices for conserving water and energy, reducing solid waste, and managing chemicals at coastal hotels along the Riviera Maya and in southern Belize.", "Crucial partnerships between conservation groups and the tourism industry have also taken root in the Coral Triangle.", "In developing nations like Indonesia, where human and financial resources are slim, the cooperation of private tourism businesses has been instrumental in accomplishing reef conservation goals.", "For example, Bunaken National Park, in north Sulawesi, is today managed in large part by a local association of dive operators who saw the declining quality of coral (and their livelihood) in the mid-1990s.", "The Nature Conservancy's Coral Triangle Center works at several sites in Indonesia, including the Raja Ampat Islands in Papua and Komodo National Park, a major protected marine area in the Lesser Sunda Islands.", "Komodo is now run by a nonprofit joint venture between the Nature Conservancy and a local tourism company.", "The joint venture, PT Putri Naga Komodo, was established in 2005.", "Founded in 1980, the park is a World Heritage Site and protects the habitat of the Komodo dragon, as well as important whale migration routes between the Indian and Pacific Oceans.", "The reefs are rich in coral species and home to up to 1,000 species of fish.", "\"After a decade supporting conservation in Komodo National Park, the Nature Conservancy recognized the need for self-sufficiency,\" said Marcus Matthews-Sawyer, director of tourism communications for the joint venture.", "Tourism has helped raise awareness of the destination and of the reefs' biological importance.", "Blast fishing -- using explosives to stun or kill fish -- is now prohibited within the park.", "The ban is credited with a 60 percent increase in hard coral coverage between 1996 and 2002, according to the Coral Triangle Center.", "The collection of conservation fees from tourists, about $15 a stay, is vital to sustaining park management.", "The partnership plans to have Komodo self-financed by park fees by 2012.", "Though Komodo is one of Indonesia's greatest tourism assets -- it is one of the most frequently visited nature reserves in the country -- conservation work there is also necessary to protect young fish that are a source for surrounding fishing grounds.", "Enforcement of the park zoning system, which restricts access to certain parts of the reefs, continues to be a challenge because of limited resources.", "But a major goal of the tourism partnership is supporting sustainable community use of the reef area, which includes providing alternative livelihoods to destructive fishing.", "All three reef systems -- the Great Barrier Reef, the Mesoamerican Reef and the Coral Triangle -- are jeopardized by the threat of global warming, which kills coral and leads to a bleaching effect.", "And while tourism cannot solve the problem of rising sea temperatures, the industry's cooperation to eliminate specific pressures -- by establishing a well-enforced no-take zone, or reducing wastewater pollution, for example -- helps reefs recover from bleaching and disease.", "The contribution of conservation fees to support the protected areas, which many businesses have long resisted, is also important.", "To keep coral reefs from disappearing as quickly as they have in recent years, people need to be involved and educated on every level from local government to hotel developers to cruise lines, said Sweeting of Conservation International.", "\"It took Cancun 35 years to develop to this massive size, and it took less

investigation under strict Greek privacy laws.", "Brad Wiggins, chief operating officer at U.S. security products maker CompuDyne Corp., which supplies U.S. embassies, including the one in Athens,

to U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to promise full cooperation in efforts to find the attacker, but the conservative government was criticized in Greece over the attack at Athens' most heavily guarded site.", "\"How is such an attack on the American embassy possible, when the site is the No.", "1 target in the country?", "\" said Alekos Papadopoulos, spokesman for public order at the main opposition Socialist party.", "\"This points to problems with the police's capabilities.", "\" A police task force to investigate the attack will be headed by a former counterterrorism chief

Species Act because of the loss of its sea ice habitat from global warming.", "This proposal marks the first legally binding admission by the Bush administration of the reality of global warming.", "The significance of the polar bear decision has not been missed by those who stand to benefit from a continuation of the administration's head-in-the-sand approach to global warming.", "Once protection for the polar bear is finalized, federal agencies and other large greenhouse gas emitters will be required to ensure that their emissions do not jeopardize the species.", "And the only way to avoid jeopardizing the polar bear is to reduce emissions.", "Predictably, opponents of emissions cuts are doing what they always have done: claim a scientific dispute where none exists and urge that no action be taken until the science is ``conclusive.", "'' Singing this tired tune, an editorial in the Wall Street Journal last week called the proposal to protect polar bears a ``triumph of politics over science,'' arguing that polar bears are ``overly abundant'' and that the species cannot be considered threatened until its population has declined further.", "The Journal got it wrong in every respect.", "What is remarkable about the polar bear decision is that it is a rare case of science actually triumphing over politics, not the other way around.", "From burying the National Assessment of Climate Change Impacts on the United States to trying to gag top NASA climate scientist James Hansen, the Bush administration systematically has attempted to suppress science on global warming.", "However, the ``best available science'' standard required by the Endangered Species Act forbids political and economic considerations.", "That was the basis for the strategy of my organization, the Center for Biological Diversity, when, on Feb. 16, 2005 (the same day the Kyoto Protocol entered into force without the participation of the U.S.), we filed a petition requesting protection of the polar bear.", "The Bush administration could refuse only by denying the science of global warming.", "So protecting the polar bear was the only decision it could legally make.", "Unfortunately for the polar bear, the ``best available science'' -- in fact, the only available science -- paints a grim picture.", "The bear is entirely dependent on sea ice, using it as a platform on which to travel, hunt and give birth.", "Yet each year, as the Arctic warms, the sea ice shrinks.", "Polar bear populations are already suffering from drowning, starvation and lower cub survival.", "Absent cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, the summer sea ice, and the polar bear, might disappear entirely in less than 40 years.", "All this has been documented in peer-reviewed scientific journals.", "Notwithstanding the scientific consensus that polar bears are threatened with extinction because of global warming, there always will be fossil fuel-addicted naysayers misrepresenting reality.", "Just as the tobacco industry always could find a ``scientist'' to claim that there was no link between smoking and lung cancer, climate-change deniers such as Sen. James M. Inhofe, R-Okla., always will find polar bear population numbers and trends that purport to prove that the species is doing fine.", "More polar bears are being seen near human settlements in Canada, they say, therefore polar bear populations must be increasing.", "A study by NASA and Canadian Wildlife Service scientists published in September 2006 in the journal Arctic demonstrated that more polar bears were indeed being seen on land -- not because the species was ``overly abundant'' but because the bears had nowhere else to go.", "They should be out on the ice hunting seals, but earlier breakup of sea ice means the bears are stuck on land, where they are more likely to be spotted.", "Inhofe and the Wall Street Journal would take no action to protect polar bears until their population has declined significantly.", "But five of the 19 distinct polar bear populations are already known to be declining.", "And given the undisputed trajectory of sea ice retreat, the species must still be considered threatened even if there were not yet any evidence of population decline.", "If a ship starts taking on water, you don't wait until the first passenger drowns before issuing a mayday; the passengers are clearly ``threatened'' as soon as the water starts pouring in.", "But polar bears are not the first species (nor will they likely be the last) for which we have sought the protections of the Endangered Species Act because of global warming.", "The first, in 2001, was the Kittlitz's murrelet, a small seabird that feeds at the mouth of tidewater glaciers and whose decline corresponds to the global-warming-induced retreat of those glaciers.", "Alas, the eyes of the world did not turn to the plight of the Kittlitz's murrelet, as we had hoped, and the administration quietly refused to protect it, a decision we are challenging in court.", "In 2004, we filed a petition seeking protection for the staghorn and elkhorn corals, species that have declined by more than 90 percent because of a host of threats, including global warming.", "The corals were listed as threatened species in May, but with far less fanfare than the polar bear and without an explicit recognition of global warming as a cause of their decline.", "In November, we petitioned to protect 12 penguin species, including the ice-dependent emperor penguin.", "These species are, unfortunately, just the tip of the extinction iceberg.", "One study estimates that a third of the Earth's creatures will be condemned to extinction by 2050.", "Polar bears might not be extinct until 2040, but that doesn't mean we have 30 years to do nothing.", "Hansen, the NASA climate scientist, repeatedly has warned that merely keeping up the current pace of emissions for 10 more years will irreversibly alter the Earth's climate.", "If sea levels rise 18 feet or more, a large proportion of the world's human population will be displaced -- or worse.", "Polar bears are not the only species threatened by global warming.", "Absent political action from the United States and the world, the rest of us might be as well.", "Siegel is a staff attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, which is dedicated to the conservation of imperiled plants and animals."]}, {"headline": "Greenland cuts polar bear hunting quota", "id": "AFP_ENG_20070118.0496", "wordCounts": {"september": 1,

on top of a second support nine stories below, shearing it free and creating a fatal imbalance that sent the 22-story crane toppling across a two-block swath of Turtle Bay, officials said Sunday.", "Officials were focusing their investigation in part on the way the steel piece -- called a \"collar\" -- was being installed, including whether a series of hoists and nylon straps used to hold it temporarily in place were strong enough to sustain its weight, said Patricia J. Lancaster, the buildings commissioner.", "Building officials estimated the weight at 12,000 pounds.", "Meanwhile, work crews and rescuers swarmed over the site of the disaster, on 51st Street and 50th Street just east of Second Avenue.", "They began to remove portions of the broken crane's white lattice tower, one leaning against a 19-story building on 51st Street and another, which had broken off and tumbled through the air, lying across a demolishedfour-story town house on 50th Street.", "Four construction workers -- a crane operator and three riggers who were helping to \"jump\" the crane, or increase its height -- were killed.", "Three people were missing.", "On Sunday, as hope dwindled, firefighters, including a unit that specializes in building collapses, continued to search for signs of life.", "\"We're still calling it a search operation, though with each passing hour, things are getting more grim,\" said Nicholas Scoppetta, the fire commissioner.", "Speaking at a news conference near the scene, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said 24 people were injured.", "Buildings Department officials said construction on the building had been halted while the investigation continued.", "\"As far as we can tell, all procedures that were called for were being followed, but it's much too early to make a definitive decision,\" Bloomberg said.", "\"We will look to see whether or not there was human error or mechanical error or whether or not our procedures just aren't adequate.", "At this point in time, we don't know, and we don't want to rush to any judgment.", "\" On Saturday, hundreds of workers boiled about the site, and several other cranes were brought in to help lift heavy sections of latticed steel from the toppled crane.", "Meanwhile, dozens of onlookers gazed from behind metal barricades on Second Avenue.", "At the site of the demolished town house, which had a bar called Fubar in the ground floor and apartments above, ironworkers cut up sections of the toppled crane and removed pieces of the building.", "Each time they cleared a section of the rubble, rescue workers descended on a ladder and then crawled farther into the collapsed ruins, armed with listening devices to search for signs of life.", "Red Cross workers handed out coffee to rescue workers at the site while a Starbucks at the corner of 50th Street and Second Avenue gave out free coffee.", "Seventeen buildings were evacuated, and most people were still not able to get inside.", "One man, however, was given 10 minutes to dash into his apartment in the building at the corner of 50th Street and Second Avenue, which was damaged in the disaster, to retrieve his pet guinea pig.", "The man, Seth Shearer, 24, said he persuaded officials to let him inside because he was scheduled to leave town on vacation and would not be able to get the animal until later.", "Most people who had been displaced found lodging with relatives or made other arrangements.", "Several streets in the area remained closed, and officials said they hoped to have at least one lane of Second Avenue opened by Monday morning.", "The disaster occurred at 2:22 p.m. on Saturday, a day workers on the high-rise condominium under construction at 303 E. 51st St. had spent adding two or more 13-foot sections to increase the crane's height, a process known as \"jumping\" or \"climbing\" the crane.", "By the time they were done, the crane's tower had reached a height of more than 200 feet, or about 20 stories.", "That structure was topped by a cab and jib extending farther.", "At that point, the workers turned to the process of bracing the crane by positioning a steel collar around the outside of the crane's tower at the building's 18th floor.", "The collar, which officials said weighed about 12,000 pounds and was made of two U-shaped pieces of steel joined together, was to be secured to the tower and then tied by steel struts to the building.", "As the work progressed, the collar was suspended high above the ground from metal hoists, known as chain blocks, connected to a higher section of the steel tower with slings made of thick nylon webbing, according to a person involved in the recovery.", "But as workers were maneuvering the collar into place, it broke free and plummeted down the crane's tower, like a ring around a steel tube sliding down.", "It slammed into another collar already in place at the ninth floor, shearing it from the struts that held it to the building and carrying it down to smash into yet another collar at the third floor.", "Unmoored and unbalanced, the spindly structure teetered and fell, the heavy cab and counterweights at the top pulling it down onto the buildings to the south.", "Lancaster said investigators were looking at how the collar was being maneuvered into place just before it fell and whether theslings might have broken.", "She said investigators would try to determine whether the slings were worn or damaged or if they were strong enough to hold the collar's weight.", "The person involved in the recovery provided a photograph of the collapsed collar showing one of the nylon straps still attached with what appeared to be a frayed and broken end.", "Lancaster also said the position of the cab, with its approximately 40 tons of counterbalances, might have contributed to the disaster.", "\"The counterweight was pointing south, and so it pulled the crane away from the building,\" she said.", "\"If it had been pointing north, it would have pulled the crane into the building.", "\" Scrutiny Sunday was also on the developer and the contractors involved in the work.", "The crane was owned by New York Crane &amp;amp; Equipment Corp., but it had apparently been leased to one of the contractors involved in the project.", "Lancaster said the company in charge of the crane was an Elizabeth, N.J., subcontractor on the construction project known as Joy Contractors Inc., identified as JCI in Building Department documents.", "Lancaster said her agency was still determining what other construction jobs JCI was involved in.", "The crane installation was designed and approved by Peter J. Stroh, an engineer based in West Babylon, N.Y., according to a permit issued for the equipment in January.", "Stroh's company was helping Sunday with the removal of a crane piece that lay tilted against an apartment house on 51st Street, opposite the construction site, according to officials.", "The lead developer on the project was James P. Kennelly, a retired firefighter with a law degree who branched out into real estate.", "He has done about two dozen projects since he opened his own development company in the mid-1980s, but the building on East 51st, which is to rise to 43 stories, with 180 condominium apartments, was by far the largest.", "The biggest building he had built before was a 14-story apartment building on East 30th Street in Manhattan.", "Kennelly issued a statement Saturday saying he had instructed his construction manager, Reliance Construction Group, known as RCG, to cooperate with investigators.",

construction fatalities fell to 12 in 2007 from 18 in 2006.", "There were at least five fatalities this year before the crane collapse Saturday.", "James Conway, political director of Local 14 of the
