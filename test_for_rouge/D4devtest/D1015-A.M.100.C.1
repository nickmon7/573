The RSSs will monitor 2,200 square kilometers of the Amazon rain forest, which it will pass over every 105 minutes, said Brazil's National Institute of Space Research.
Xishuangbanna, one of China's largest tropical rain forest reserves, will almost double its area to bring more wild plants and animals under protection.
Satellites currently monitoring the region cannot see clearly through the thick clouds which cover the region for several months annually, but the RSSs can do that.
Malaysia, also endowed with rich tropical rain forest, will build bases on its territory to pick up and analyse data from the satellites.
