Fighting broke out Thursday after the heavily-armed renegade clansmen, who want more autonomy and increased benefits from the area's natural resources, ambushed paramilitary Frontier Corps soldiers.
Lasi said they had dug more trenches about 500 to 1,000 meters (yards) from the base.
More than 3,000 government employees and their families escaped Saturday in vehicles under paramilitary escort from Dera Bugti after a 16-hour battle in the town last week.
