Magne Ognedal, director general of the safety authority, said his staff is working intensely on reviewing a startup proposal submitted by Statoil this week, but needs more information.
Statoil has proposed resuming full production on Vigdis (75,000 bpd), and partial production on Snorre A, by pumping up oil through underwater extensions while repairs continue on the platform itself.
Norway's oil production has been reduced by some 205,000 barrels per day.
Statoil ASA said Tuesday it expects to restart its Snorre A offshore petroleum platform later this week, almost a month after a natural gas leak shut down operations.
