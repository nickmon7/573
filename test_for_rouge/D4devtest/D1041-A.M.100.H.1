For some time, scientists have predicted that the world's coral reefs will be among the first ecosystems to suffer devastating damage from global warming.
COA officials said the artificial reefs not only function to prevent the deterioration of fishing grounds but also help increase fish stocks.
But this kind of adaptation may not be enough "to let corals off the hook," as Knowlton of the Scripps Institution put it in an interview.
If something isn't done soon, it will be too late for many reefs to recover.
