Grasonville, Md., in front of W.H.", "Harris Seafood.", "Heaped like a pile of rocks in the middle of the boat was the morning's haul -- oysters, the rough and craggy bottom dwellers that have been the shining jewels of the Chesapeake Bay for generations.", "From the dock, Jason Ruth, a worker at Harris', began culling the pile with an expert's eye, selecting those to keep and shuck and those to return to the bay.", "Taking handfuls at a time, Ruth flung the oysters back into the water.", "\"See,\" he said, picking up one in a fluid motion and knocking it with a quick tap against the pile, making a hollow thunk.", "\"There's nothing there.", "It's dead.", "Gone.", "\" The shell landed back in the water with a splash.", "Similar scenes are unfolding these days up and down the Chesapeake Bay, where the annual oyster season is becoming an endangered tradition.", "For centuries, the Chesapeake has been synonymous with oysters.", "For early settlers, oyster reefs were so abundant that they posed a hazard for navigation, and with the introduction of canning in the 1800s, the Chesapeake became the source for oysters around the world.", "But the annual good cheer surrounding the season is waning.", "That is because Chesapeake watermen pulled an all-time low of about 25,000 bushels of oysters from the bay last year, compared with 80,000 in 1993 -- and a staggering 15 million back in the glory days of 1885.", "From 1920 to 1970, before the oyster began its rapid decline, the industry contributed $65 million annually to the state of Maryland, a figure that didn't include the tourism it attracted.", "The annual figure has fallen to $500,000.", "Overharvesting and pollution have taken a toll on the native oyster, but far bigger threats to the species are two parasites that attack them, Dermo and MSX, which were first detected in the bay in the 1960s.", "Harris' is a holdout in a devastated industry; one of the last oyster-packing companies on the Chesapeake, where once there were hundreds.", "Just a few miles across the Chesapeake Bay Bridge from Annapolis, the waters of Kent Narrows, which leads to the bay, were home to 13 oyster packing houses at about the time Harris' opened in 1947.", "Now, it stands alone in the shadow of the Kent Narrows Bridge.", "But some oysters do survive in the bay.", "Harris' shucks, packs and sells them at its packing company and serves them in its dockside restaurant overlooking the narrows.", "At the height of oyster season, which began Oct. 1 and runs through the end of March, Harris' rolls out an all-you-can-eat buffet, featuring oysters served seven different ways.", "Indeed, fall oyster celebrations still abound in bayside communities on the Chesapeake, where old traditions die hard and the oysters remain as much a symbol of the season's arrival as cider, apples and pumpkins.", "Here, the mighty oyster is toasted in the wood-paneled oyster bars of Annapolis -- McGarvey's, O'Brien's and the Middleton Tavern -- and honored along the bay's shores at festivals, shucking contests and skipjack races.", "The events spotlighting oysters in October and November unfold like oysters on the half shell -- by

federal fur research project in 1943.", "For the nutria, which resemble waddling beavers with naked tails, the area turned out to be a garden spot.", "There were huge expanses of a marsh plant they love, called three-square bulrush.", "For the bulrush, and the numerous species of birds, fish and mammals that lived in the bulrush marshes, the news wasn't so good.", "Nutria act like a ``mammalian lawn mower,'' in the words of scientist Robert Thomas, a professor at Loyola University in New Orleans -- eating the plants, roots and all, and leaving huge stretches of bare mud.", "Without roots to hold it, in many places the mud simply washed away.", "About half of the refuge's marshland, a crucial pollution filter that scientists call the ``kidneys'' of the Chesapeake, had become open water by the 1990s.", "Authorities first offered rewards to trappers who caught nutria: $1.50 apiece.", "But when nutria became difficult to find, trappers decided the rodent wasn't worth their time.", "Any remaining animals -- blessed with an ability to produce more than 10 young in a year -- would then quickly repopulate.", "``It's sort of like a whack-a-mole game,'' said Steve Kendrot, the Department of Agriculture official in charge of Blackwater's trapping efforts.", "Government officials also tried to make nutria into a dinner-table delicacy.", "That, too, failed: People who will eat nutria are pretty much the same people who eat muskrat -- not much of a mass market.", "``There's just not a lot of people out there who can stomach them,'' said Dan Murphy of the Fish and Wildlife Service's Chesapeake office.", "Including him: ``I don't eat rat,'' Murphy said.", "The idea behind the recent eradication effort was to use full-time trappers, paid by the hour and not by the nutria.", "The trappers would act like a conquering army, slowly taking territory in a west-to-east march that was guided by GBS equipment.", "In the summer, the trappers had to fend off mosquitoes and biting greenhead flies.", "There were also spiders and the danger of the occasional bite from a nutria's inch-long orange buckteeth.", "Winter in the marsh, while often frigid, turned out to be the easy season.", "Once the water froze, the nutria couldn't swim away, and trappers could shoot them by the dozens on the ice.", "``There's really about two months of the year when this is a pleasant occupation,'' Kendrot said.", "This September, the anti-nutria team got the news they were waiting for: Surveys showed they had effectively cleared the animals from more than 35,000 acres in and around Blackwater.", "As it turned out, the nutria death toll had been much lower than they expected, since early speculation was that 50,000 ``nutes'' were in the refuge.", "Scientists say the rest were killed by recent cold winters or by a decline in food, as so much of the marsh already was eaten.", "With the nutria gone, the marsh is starting to look the way it did 70 years ago, officials said.", "(Begin optional trim) Officials in Maryland said they hope their success can be a model for the roughly 16 other states with nutria problems.", "But in Louisiana, the only state with a bigger nutria population than Maryland's, authorities said they doubted whether a similar eradication was possible there.", "Millions of nutria are in that swampy state, and trappers routinely match the catch at Blackwater, about 8,300, in a couple of days.", "In Maryland, authorities say they want to slowly expand their nutria-free zone to include the rest of the Eastern Shore, where tens of thousands more nutria lurk between the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and Ocean City.", "The whole effort will require millions more in funding and many more trappers, officials said.", "``It was a major battle that has, for the most part, been won,'' said Jacoby Carter, a national expert on nutria for the U.S. Geological Survey.", "``But you've got to worry about the guerrilla warfare.", "'' "]},

say, have left the bay no cleaner than it was when the ``Chesapeake 2000'' pact was signed.", "A Maryland congressman is contemplating legislation to replace the voluntary cleanup strategy with strict regulatory requirements.", "Governors are pledging to walk the halls of Congress lobbying for $12 billion in needed support.", "And scientists are exploring the mass introduction of a Chinese oyster to replace the vanishing native breed.", "``Business as usual won't work,'' said former Virginia Gov.", "Gerald Baliles, who led a committee that studied the bay cleanup last year.", "``More of the same is asking for trouble.", "'' The agreement to clean the bay in 10 years promised twice as much underwater grass, 10 times as many oysters, and water as pristine as in the 1950s.", "It was touted as ``America's premier watershed restoration partnership,'' supported by the Environmental Protection Agency and representatives from Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C. Thirteen years before, the same entities had pledged to reduce the pollutants nitrogen and phosphorus in the bay by 40 percent.", "When the deadline came in 2000, they had fallen short.", "The new agreement, an attempt to jump-start the effort, made more sweeping promises.", "The idea was, ``if we can do this ... nobody else in the world has an excuse,'' said William Matuszeski, who was then overseeing the bay cleanup for the EPA.", "It was a daunting task: to reduce pollution spewing from a multitude of city sewers, farms and factories across a 64,000-square-mile watershed.", "The tools were unwieldy, including several federal agencies and an array of state governments that eventually included Delaware, West Virginia and New York.", "Even so, cleanup officials say, they expected to accomplish more by now than they have.", "``We've made only modest progress,'' Rebecca Hanmer, head of the EPA bay program, conceded in a recent interview.", "Consider: -- The 2000 agreement targeted the problem of low dissolved oxygen, a condition in which fish and crabs can't breathe.", "This would mean reducing nitrogen and phosphorus, found in suburban lawn fertilizer, processed sewage and animal manure.", "These pollutants, when washed downstream to the bay, feed algae blooms that suck oxygen out of the water.", "But at the current rate, the nitrogen goal won't be met until 2038, and problems with oxygen-poor areas haven't changed.", "The summer of 2003 was one of the worst on record, as nearly 40 percent of the Chesapeake became a suffocating expanse that environmentalists dubbed the ``dead zone.", "'' -- The agreement promised to increase the number of oysters tenfold.", "Instead, their numbers have fallen off sharply because of pollution, low oxygen and endemic disease.", "In five years alone, the Maryland oyster harvest has dropped 92 percent, hitting a record low last year with 26,000 bushels.", "-- Underwater grasses are supposed to grow to 185,000 acres by 2010.", "But algae and sediment cloud the water, blocking sunlight.", "A survey of the bay's grasses in 2003, found about 64,000 acres -- 35 percent of the goal.", "Some scientists and watermen say the bay shows few signs that anybody has spent five years trying to save it.", "``There really hasn't been a noticeable improvement,'' said Denise Breitburg, a senior scientist at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center in Edgewater, Md.", "``The major problems that the Chesapeake Bay agreement was designed to diminish are still there.", "'' The Chesapeake Bay Foundation assesses the bay's overall health annually and rates it on a 100-point scale.", "In 2000, the foundation rated the bay a 28.", "Since then, the rating has changed -- to 27.", "``I wouldn't hold it up as a success story, put it that way,'' said ecologist Robert Howarth of Cornell University.", "(Begin optional trim) The consequences are even more troubling for watermen, for whom the bay provides both a livelihood and cultural touchstone.", "Douglas Jenkins Sr., 70, of Virginia's Northern Neck, said he's seen the signs both on land -- where the number of watermen has dropped because of low oyster harvests -- and in the water.", "For instance, boat anchors used to come up with a menagerie of tiny bottom-dwelling animals crawling on them: sand fleas, worms, snails.", "Those animals are gone, and probably dead, Jenkins said.", "``The little shells or carcasses are about all you see,'' Jenkins said.", "(End trim) How did the bay get to this condition?", "Experts say the problem was a desire to plan all pollution efforts in minute detail while keeping major changes on hold.", "Matuszeski, the bay program's leader from 1991 to 2001, said officials knew their work would revolve around renovating sewage plants and keeping farm manure out of streams.", "But first, the bay cleanup bureaucracy worked on official water standards -- figuring out exactly how clean the bay should be.", "That process was supposed to take one year.", "It took three, with Washington, the states and the federal government spending a combined $1 billion a year.", "Then individual jurisdictions were to write detailed plans for cleaning up each tributary.", "The plans, due by 2002, still aren't finished.", "``We could have gotten to work,'' Matuszeski said.", "``It didn't happen because people were afraid that we didn't have the numbers right.", "'' Some environmentalists say this planning marathon was actually stalling to allow politicians to avoid changes that would anger farmers and sewage customers.", "Hanmer, the EPA's bay director, defended the work, saying it's been slow but necessary for all the cooperating agencies to buy in.", "``Now people cannot say, 'Rebecca, we don't know what needs to be done,' '' she said.", "Hanmer pointed to some recent successes, including Maryland's passage of a ``flush tax'' to reduce pollution from sewage plants and the EPA's requirement that plants must further clean the water they dump into the watershed.", "But even she wouldn't say the cleanup effort is on pace to meet the 2010 deadline.", "``I'm certainly not going to tell you that we can't meet it,'' Hanmer said.", "``I don't think it's the right message to send.", "'' Rep. Wayne Gilchrest, R-Md., doesn't want to wait for 2010.", "Gilchrest wants legislation that would force the cleanup to spend less time on bureaucracy, as well as stronger regulations and punishment for those who pollute, he said.", "``What we want to do is lock in a better bay program that will be a hundred times more effective,'' Gilchrest said.", "Still, he said, it might be two years before the changes go through.", "State governors from around the watershed have approved a proposal that would create a massive new pool of funding for the bay, with $12 billion from the federal government.", "But many observers wonder how the states will get the money since the federal government is already tightening budgets.", "Then there is the Chinese oyster, which governors in Maryland and Virginia believe might resist disease and provide a natural pollution filter.", "Already there is no shortage of opposition to this plan.", "Scientists worry it will bring in disease; based on their concerns, Maryland state legislators are trying to block it.", "The failures leave a bewildering disconnect for those who are removed from the nitty-gritty of environmental policy.", "On paper is the bay as national treasure, on the way to resurrection.", "Then there's the bay they know -- sickly and murky and perhaps getting worse.", "(Begin optional add end) It's made Jenkins, the Northern Neck waterman, skeptical of all deadlines for the Chesapeake's comeback.", "``It was going to be the '90s ... then the year 2000, then it was the year 2010,'' he said.", "``When 2010 gets here, I guess

Island and Sri Lanka for many years.", "Both areas were hard hit by the tsunami.", "Now based in Rhode Island, Hale said the tsunami may have caused lasting environmental damage that may take decades or longer to recover from.", "\"This is a massive, massive erosion event,\" she said.", "A UN task force based in Geneva will assess two things: environmental damage that threatens human health, and the toll on the ecological resources -- many of which support tourism and the fishing industry.", "The Indian Ocean region, with its aqua, shallow seas, hosts some of the most beloved and famous coral reefs in the world that support scores of fish species found nowhere else.", "Mangroves are critical nurseries for many of these fish.", "And the beaches of Sri Lanka, the Andaman and Nicobar islands,

Thursday said they expect marine life from shore to about a mile out to have suffered the worst damage.", "However, some biologists speculated that marine mammals such as whales and dolphins swimming near shore when the tsunami struck may have sensed the strange seas and headed for deeper waters, where the giant waves were barely noticeable.", "Land animals may have had the same \"sixth sense\" to

comprehensive historical data about marine damage that tsunamis can cause, especially one of this magnitude.", "They do know that in 1883, when the Krakatoa volcano exploded and sent a giant tsunami washing over Indonesia, coral heads that weighed hundreds of tons were tossed hundreds of feet inland.", "And in 1964, when a tsunami hit Alaska, news reports noted that baby salmon were killed, although it's unclear how many.", "This week, dive operators and researchers began sending e-mails to the WorldFish Center in Malaysia, an international fisheries research center, painting an early bleak picture of the region's treasured coastal waters.", "On Phuket Island, one popular beach was piled with dead staghorn coral, starfish, gulper eels, sea cucumbers, and sea grasses.", "In the Maldives, dive operator Norbert Schmidt said the eastern part of the island was hit the worst, with dead coral and sand covering the runway at Hulule International Airport.", "In Sri Lanka and Thailand, coral damage is reported to be severe, and trees have crashed down onto reefs, ripping many of the corals, some hundreds of years old, apart.", "\"Many fish washed ashore, trees that were knocked down (smashed) into the reefs,\" Michiru Main, a researcher who was conducting a reef survey at Mu Ko Surin, a popular dive spot in Thailand, when the tsunami struck, said in an e-mail.", "\"I can definitely say there is damage in the area.", "\" Already stressed from fishing and tourism, many of the reefs may be covered in mud, which can block sunlight that fish and other organisms below them need.", "Meanwhile, corals, which only grow a fraction of an inch each year, may be excreting mucus as a defensive mechanism against the mud -- \"expensive in terms of energy (that) weakens the coral,\" e-mailed Marco Noordeloos of the WorldFish Center.", "Noordeloos said fish populations have probably been damaged, too, although it's far too early to get a complete picture.", "Some

Wednesday about the safety of Pfizer's bestselling Celebrex.", "Writing in the medical journal, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, chief of pharmacology at the University of Pennsylvania, said studies suggest the same mechanism that makes the drugs easier on the stomach than traditional painkillers also blocks a substance that prevents heart problems.", "\"I believe this is a class effect,\" he said, meaning the problem that caused Vioxx to be removed also could apply to Celebrex and Pfizer's newer and similar drug, Bextra.", "Meanwhile, the European Medicines Agency in London announced it would review drugs similar to Vioxx.", "And a congressman requested the U.S. Food and Drug Adminstration answer questions about the medications used to treat arthritis, diagnosed in more than 49 million people.", "Pfizer said both Celebrex and Bextra will remain on the market and that there's no reason they shouldn't.", "Company spokeswoman Maryann Caprino described FitzGerald's article as \"an interesting hypothesis\" but said that \"in terms of the real world, we totally disagree.", "\" The FDA said last week after Vioxx was withdrawn that the problems were unique to that drug.", "But FitzGerald suggested that by selectively blocking one of the two substances called prostaglandins that lead to inflammation, these Cox-2 inhibitors were sparing the stomach at the expense of the heart.", "Dr. W. Hayes Wilson, chief of rheumatology at Piedmont Hospital in Atlanta, urged people taking the drugs not to panic.", "He said he sees no reason for people using Celebrex to stop.", "\"We all take reasonable risks in our lives,\" the physician said.", "Five years ago, FitzGerald published research \"revealing a mechanism\" in both Vioxx and Celebrex that could \"predispose people .", ".", ".", "to the risk of heart attack or stroke,\" he said in an interview.", "\"Over the years, evidence has slowly accumulated consistent with that hypothesis.", "\" Merck officials said last week its latest research showed an increased risk of heart attack and other cardiovascular complications in patients who took Vioxx for at least 18 months.", "FDA urged to weigh in Vioxx, Celebrex and Bextra are the only three drugs in a class known as Cox-2 inhibitors.", "The Cox-2 inhibitors cause fewer gastrointestinal side effects, including upset stomach, heartburn and ulcers, than other pain-relieving drugs.", "Merck took the drastic step of pulling Vioxx because its research showed it caused increased risk of heart attack.", "The drugmaker's colon cancer study of 2,600 people was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the standard 25-milligram dose in preventing a recurrence of colon polyps.", "But the study was halted when it indicated a heightened risk of cardiovascular complications.", "FitzGerald said the Food and Drug Administration \"has a responsibility to provide informed, unbiased information rapidly to advise doctors and their patients as to how to respond to the withdrawal of Vioxx.", "\" So far, he said, that information has come almost entirely from Merck and Celebrex.", "\"The question for the FDA is whether there should be a general warning, particularly for patients who are at high risk of cardiovascular disease,\" the doctor said.", "\"I'm trying to prompt guidance from an unbiased source, and it should come urgently.", "\" The FDA had no comment Wednesday on the report.", "But U.S. Rep. Tom Davis of Virginia, Republican chairman of the House Government Reform Committee, sent a letter to FDA's acting commissioner, Dr. Lester Crawford, giving him two weeks to answer questions about how FDA tracks problems with drug safety, how it dealt with issues surrounding Vioxx and whether the agency will study potential risks in similar drugs.", "\"I am concerned whether FDA has been sufficiently aggressive in monitoring drug safety,\" Davis said.", "Along with the FitzGerald piece, The New England Journal of Medicine also posted a second article on the Internet, two weeks ahead of scheduled publication, signaling a more immediate concern.", "The second article in the medical journal, by Dr. Eric Topol of the Cleveland Clinic, criticizes the FDA for not requiring Merck to do studies investigating heart problems with Vioxx even though hints of danger appeared years ago.", "Topol also criticized the FDA for letting Merck blitz consumers with TV ads pushing the drug.", "Twenty-seven million prescriptions have been written for Celebrex since 1999, Caprino said.", "Celebrex earned $1.5 billion in the first six months of this year, she said.", "By contrast, Vioxx made $2.5 billion for Merck last year.", "Celebrex and Vioxx have become household names in recent years.", "Rich Tomaselli of Advertising Age Magazine said Merck spent $78 million advertising Vioxx last year, compared to $96 million for Celebrex, the 10th most popular drug in the country.", "Long-term studies on Bextra, which was approved by the FDA in 2001, are not yet available.", "Wilson at Piedmont Hospital pointed out that there are alternatives to such medicines, like weight loss and exercise prescribed by a therapist.", "\"Most people want a pill to make them better,\" he said.", "\"But there are other things they can learn that are nonpharmacological.", "\" He thought the concerns, however, would result in more conversations between doctors and patients.", "\"I think it's good we are looking at safety,\" Wilson said.", "\"But we need to understand that anything strong enough to help you is potentially strong enough to have a side effect.", "\" For people too worried about the risks to continue taking prescription medications, he suggested over-the-counter drugs like Tylenol, at least until they have time to consult with their doctor.", "\"I did have a patient who said, 'I've heard about Vioxx, I hear Celebrex is next.", "' Then I gave her the facts,\" he said.", "\"(And) I offered one of the older anti-inflammatories, and she said, 'I think I'd rather stay on

regulators said they feared such drugs might raise the risk of heart problems like those blamed on the arthritis medicine Vioxx.", "Heavily advertised as an arthritis drug, Vioxx was pulled from the market last week after its maker said a study showed it doubled the risk of heart attack and stroke.", "But the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said similar prescription drugs were safe.", "On Wednesday, the European Medicines Agency in London announced it would review all drugs of this type.", "And researchers writing in the New England Journal of Medicine voiced their concerns as well with such drugs as Pfizer's popular Celebrex.", "The medical journal published two reports on the issue Wednesday on the Internet _ more than two weeks ahead of their planned print publication _ to help inform doctors and patients considering whether to stop using the drugs.", "Studies done five years ago when Celebrex and Merck &amp; Co.'s Vioxx were approved suggest that the same mechanism that inhibits inflammation and makes the drugs easier on the stomach than traditional painkillers also blocks a substance that prevents heart problems, according to Dr. Garret FitzGerald, a University of Pennsylvania cardiologist.", "FitzGerald led the studies, which were designed by him but funded by the drug companies.", "\"I believe this is a class effect,\" he said, meaning that the problem also applies to Celebrex and Pfizer's newer, similar drug, Bextra, which remain on the market.", "He called on the FDA to change its advice to patients and doctors to reflect the new safety concerns.", "Pfizer's medical director, Dr. Gail Cawkwell, insisted that its drugs are safe.", "\"The data for Celebrex is robust and exceeds, in the length of patients in studies and in the size of studies, the data Vioxx has,\" she said.", "She called FitzGerald's contention \"an interesting theory,\" but said, \"there is no evidence\" of increased risk of heart problems among the 75 million Americans who have taken Celebrex.", "Long-term studies are not yet available on Bextra, which was approved in 2001.", "Celebrex is the 10th most popular drug in the United States, with annual sales of $2.7 billion, up 5 percent in a year, according to IMS Health, a company that tracks drug industry trends.", "In a separate report also released by the medical journal, Dr. Eric Topol of the Cleveland Clinic chastises the FDA for not requiring Merck to do studies investigating heart problems with Vioxx when hints of them first appeared years ago, and for allowing the company to blitz consumers with TV ads touting the drug.", "Vioxx was the largest prescription drug withdrawal in history, \"but had the many warning signs along the way been heeded, such a debacle could have been prevented,\" Topol wrote.", "\"Neither Merck nor the FDA fulfilled its responsibilities to the public ...", "I believe there should be a full Congressional review of this case.", "\" An FDA official said the agency would have no immediate comment.", "When Merck voluntarily withdrew Vioxx, FDA officials said heart problems were unique to that drug and that the mechanism underlying them wasn't known.", "But FitzGerald and colleagues published two studies in 1999 and another in 2001 suggesting that by selectively blocking one of the two substances called prostaglandins that lead to inflammation, these so-called cox-2 inhibitors were sparing the stomach at the expense of the heart.", "\"There's a good prostaglandin and a bad prostaglandin as far as the heart is concerned,\" he explained.", "Suppressing both, as older painkillers like aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDS do, helps the heart.", "But shutting down just the \"good\" one raises the risk of high blood pressure, hardening of the arteries and clotting, he reports.", "FitzGerald also challenged Pfizer's contention that no science shows increased risk from Celebrex.", "The original report from one study involving Celebrex found no increased risk of heart problems, but it covered only six months of a year-long study, according to the cardiologist.", "A look at the full data \"reveals signs of increased cardiovascular risk,\" he writes.", "The medical journal will publish the new reports in its Oct. 21 print edition.", "Meanwhile, Republican Congressman Tom Davis of Virginia, who chairs the House Government Reform Committee, sent a letter to FDA's acting commissioner, Dr. Lester Crawford, giving him two weeks to answer questions about how FDA tracks problems with drug safety, how it dealt with issues surrounding Vioxx, and whether the agency will study potential risks in similar drugs.", "\"In light of Merck's withdrawal of Vioxx from the market and other recent news stories examining FDA's review of the safety and efficacy of anti-depressant drug use by children, I am concerned whether FDA has been sufficiently aggressive in monitoring drug safety,\"

"The turbulence outside the aircraft was an echo of the corporate tempest leading up to their trip.", "For five days Merck had been struggling with what to do with frightening new data that showed that long-term use of their $2.5 billion arthritis drug Vioxx doubled the risk of heart attacks and strokes, confirming concerns raised by earlier studies.", "Now research lab director Peter Kim and general counsel Kenneth Frazier were flying to Boston to tell one of the men most responsible for Vioxx's success that Merck would be pulling the drug in two days.", "As they sat at the former lab director's dining table that night, they watched Edward Scolnick, who had been a champion of the drug before he retired, take in the implications of the data and become ``despondent,'' they said.", "Scolnick was the one who had thrown Merck's resources behind the creation of Vioxx, a painkiller with fewer gastrointestinal side effects than traditional drugs.", "Backed by a $195 million ad campaign, featuring testimonials from former skater Dorothy Hamill and music by the Rascals to appeal to aging baby boomers, Merck had sold Vioxx to more than 20 million Americans since its approval in 1999 and millions more worldwide.", "Now their wonder drug was suddenly under a cloud and Merck officials faced a difficult decision about how to handle the catastrophe.", "On Sept. 30, the company took the dramatic step of withdrawing the drug, sending the price of its stock into a steep slide that wiped out a quarter of the company's value, a slide from which it has not yet recovered.", "An examination of how and why Merck reacted offers an unusual look at how safety issues are handled in clinical trials once a drug is on the market and the complex business of weighing risks against benefits.", "Even as Merck was deciding to withdraw the drug, there were medical experts arguing that it should not.", "It also shows that federal regulators often rely on drug companies to tell them that a product is dangerous.", "The whole saga, industry experts said, raises unsettling questions about aggressive consumer marketing of drugs before their long-term safety has been proven.", "Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, who has launched an investigation into the Food and Drug Administration's handling of Vioxx said one of the questions will be whether ``a too cozy relationship between the FDA and drug companies is getting in the way of public safety.", "'' Over the past two weeks The Washington Post had interviewed independent researchers who collected and reviewed the Vioxx data, company officials who decided how Merck would respond, critics of the drug industry and regulators who, in the end, played almost no role in its recall.", "With Vioxx, researchers had been warning about the drug's possible cardiovascular risks since 2000, only a year after it was approved by the FDA.", "Data from a company study found then that users had four times as many heart attacks and strokes as those who used another painkiller.", "But the data was not definitive, and Merck, which even critics say is one of the most responsible drug companies, repeatedly reassured the medical and financial communities that Vioxx was safe.", "Independent studies of Vioxx users continued to add to the questions, and the FDA began its own review.", "The safety officer who conducted it concluded this summer that the drug posed a serious risk.", "But he said that the results were ignored and that the FDA made efforts to silence him.", "When the recall occurred, it came about because of a major clinical study sponsored by Merck that tracked 2,600 patients for almost three years to find out if Vioxx helped prevent colon polyps.", "Merck launched the effort hoping to create new markets for Vioxx, while also laying to rest questions about the drug's connection to heart attacks and strokes.", "Far from it, the trial confirmed the predictions of Merck's harshest critics, who had long complained that the New Jersey manufacturer was closing its eyes to Vioxx's problems and improperly pushing a dangerous drug onto consumers with aggressive ads.", "Vioxx and other Cox-2 inhibitors like Celebrex had been promoted as wonder drugs, since they provided pain relief to arthritis sufferers without causing stomach problems, but now Vioxx is off the market and the others are under a cloud.", "Cleveland Clinic cardiologist Eric Topol, an early critic of the drug, estimates Vioxx may have caused 30,000 to 100,000 heart attacks and strokes, many of them ``preventable'' because patients could have taken other drugs.", "``Why didn't they stop the DTC (direct to consumer) marketing?", "'' that was a major factor in increasing sales, he said.", "``That's the tragedy here.", "'' The last days of Vioxx began with FedEx deliveries on Sept. 14.", "That was when the four members of the colon polyp trial's Data and Safety Monitoring Board, an independent panel of specialists hired to catch harmful developments in the trial, received heart attack and stroke data for the previous six months.", "Most clinical trials include independent safety monitors, and their role is little understood but crucial.", "The four monitors, along with a Merck statistician were the only ones with full access to information about the trial, including which patients were getting Vioxx and which were getting the placebo.", "As a result, they alone were in a position to conclude the drug had proven too dangerous for the trial to continue.", "The same team also was monitoring another Merck trial to see if Vioxx might help protect against prostate cancer.", "A third trial was studying the drug's effect on colon cancer was also underway.", "All three trials were placebo-controlled and ``blinded'' to investigators, making them the most trusted kind of drug research.", "These studies also were designed to answer questions about cardiovascular risk raised by earlier less conclusive research.", "From the beginning of the colon polyp study, the safety monitors had noted an increased rate of hypertension among the Vioxx group.", "In addition, in 2003 and earlier this year, they found that more people in the Vioxx group were having cardiovascular events than in the placebo group.", "The numbers were small, in part because people with heart disease had been screened out of the trial, but the trend had been worrisome and the latest data were striking: After 18 months on the drug, the Vioxx group was clearly having more heart problems than the placebo group and the rate of difference was accelerating.", "``When I saw the last set of data, I knew we had a tough decision to make,'' said James Neaton, a University of Minnesota biostatistician, who had monitored a dozen other studies but seldom had seen such troubling data.", "``There was so much at stake for everyone involved.", "... You have to have data that the scientific community will accept.", "'' Neaton and the three safety committee members spent several days studying the data, then held their regularly scheduled phone conference Sept. 17.", "They talked first with Merck representatives and the principal investigator for the colon polyp trial, John Baron of Dartmouth Medical School.", "Then Baron and the Merck people left the call, freeing the four safety panel members to talk openly about the latest unsettling data.", "The experts agreed unanimously that the trial had to stop.", "``Coming to that conclusion, it took our breath way,'' Neaton said.", "Vioxx was Merck's fourth top seller, and they knew their decision would be extremely harmful to the company.", "Neaton immediately called Baron, who was conducting the trial with a grant from Merck, and explained the problem.", "When Neaton faxed him the ``unblinded'' data, the signal was clear: Within the small population of people suffering from cardiovascular disease, the number from the Vioxx group after 18 months of study was twice as high as the placebo group -- 15 heart attacks or strokes per 1,000 patients per year, versus 7.5 for the sugar pill.", "``I looked at it and concurred immediately that the trial should stop,'' Baron said.", "But first, Baron needed to get the approval of his steering committee of others involved in the trial.", "This took nearly a week, during which Baron took precautions to guard against leaks of negative information and insider trading of Merck shares.", "On Sept. 23 the full committee agreed to halt the trial.", "That afternoon, Baron called his contact at Merck to say that the drug presented an unacceptable risk of cardiovascular damage.", "Baron said in the next few days, as he presented the data to company officials and some outside Merck advisers, he experienced ``no pushback at all.", "'' But then again, he said, ``if an independent committee makes a recommendation like ours, only a fool would tell us to buzz off.", "'' Merck lab director Kim heard the news on when he dialed into his voice mail while driving to work, 7:30 a.m. on Sept. 24.", "``I was stunned,'' said Kim who had expected positive results.", "He and other Merck scientists pored over the data, looking for flaws but finding none.", "At midday, Kim got the general counsel Frazier on the line and called Raymond Gilmartin, Merck's chairman, president and chief executive.", "``The drug held up for three years.", "When you've been going this long you don't expect this kind of phone call,'' Gilmartin remembered in an interview soon after the drug was pulled.", "Merck critics, and there are many, say the company had plenty of warning.", "Yet Merck continued advertising.", "``There was so much denial over there,'' said David Moskowitz, senior pharmaceutical analyst for Friedman, Billings, Ramsey Co. Last week, Gilmartin and Kim still said that none of the earlier Vioxx studies, by either the company or others, convincingly showed increased heart and stroke risk from the drug.", "As a result, they said, there was no reason to stop the advertising campaign.", "``We were acting totally consistent with the data we had,'' Gilmartin said.", "``We undertook right away to ask the right questions.", "'' The company was trying to get at cardiovascular risk, he said, by initiating three clinical trials that would together give important new information on the issue.", "Many doctors and patients liked Vioxx's track record on gastrointestinal problems, a major source of worry for arthritis patients.", "But, on the phone call, when Kim delivered the new, more damaging results, Gilmartin's choices were bleak.", "Even if the painkiller stayed on the market, sales would almost certainly plummet because its advertising would be restricted and would have to carry a ``black box'' warning about the heart attack risks.", "Gilmartin was clear that the trial should be halted and that the drug might have to be taken off the market.", "``Look Peter, we're going to make this decision based on what's in the best interest of science and patient safety,'' Gilmartin recalled saying.", "``It's not that we're unaware of the consequences, but it's a deep-seated belief that if you do the right thing, rewards will follow,'' he said of the decision to pull the drug.", "The decision was also sound litigation strategy.", "The company was already facing two class action lawsuits alleging patient harm from Vioxx.", "Anything that smacked of a cover-up would have strengthened the plaintiffs' hands.", "``Running away from your problems, denial, is the worst possible choice,'' said Anthony Sabino, professor of business law at St. John's University.", "Over the next three days, Kim and his researchers convened three teleconferences with about 15 outside medical experts to get their advice.", "By then, Kim said, he was leaning toward pulling the drug.", "But the outside experts, most of whom had done previous work with Merck and were offered a fee for their consultation, had surprisingly mixed opinions.", "A sizable group were reluctant to give up a painkiller proven to have fewer gastrointestinal side effects than others and were not convinced the available alternatives were any safer, participants said.", "(On Friday, Pfizer Inc. issued a warning that its Cox-2 drug Bextra may increase cardiovascular risk for some patients.", ") Duke University cardiologist Robert Califf argued strenuously on one teleconference for keeping the drug on the market with a much stronger warning label.", "He had been railing publicly for some time about the absence of long-term cardiovascular risk studies on painkillers, a situation that he said made selecting the right drug a ``total crapshoot.", "'' In his view, the new Vioxx data quantified the risk and made it manageable.", "``The curves show not even a hint of a detrimental effect for 18 months,'' and even after that the risks did not appear that large.", "``I thought the risk was going to be larger than it was,'' he said.", "But Northwestern University rheumatologist Thomas Schnitzer argued for ditching Vioxx entirely because Merck's scientists could not explain why the drug started causing heart attacks after 18 months.", "Furthermore, Merck's carefully cultivated image would go out the window if Vioxx stayed on the market, he said, because Merck ``prides itself on its ethical approach.", "I couldn't see Merck saying we're going to market a drug with a safety problem.", "'' At lunchtime on Monday, Sept. 27, it was time to make a final decision.", "Kim, Frazier and Gilmartin gathered in the chief executive's conference room at the Whitehouse Station, N.J., campus.", "The lab director's message came in two parts: the experts were divided over whether Merck had to pull Vioxx off the market, but Kim thought they should do it anyway.", "Gilmartin said he agreed the drug should be pulled but wanted to take a decision of that magnitude to his board of directors who concurred when they met the next day.", "By then, Merck had notified the FDA that it needed an emergency meeting that afternoon, and asked that top officials be present.", "In the meeting, top FDA officials were shown preliminary slides from the colon polyp study and were told by Merck that the drug would be withdrawn.", "The FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research director Steven Galson said there was discussion of keeping the drug for short-term use, but the company did not think it was practical.", "Fearful of a leak, Merck officials waited until the next day, Wednesday, to tell international affiliates of the planned withdrawal and asked them to hold off on telling their regulators until the news was made public.", "Three Merck officials sat up all night Wednesday answering e-mails and phone calls from the foreign medical directors.", "Withdrawal day started early, with a 4 a.m. e-mail to Merck's 60,000 employees alerting them to a major announcement.", "At 9 a.m. on Sept. 30, Gilmartin and Kim took the stage at the Hilton Times Square and faced a room packed with reporters and television cameras.", "``This morning Merck is announcing a voluntary worldwide withdrawal of Vioxx,'' Gilmartin began.", "Since the Merck decision, public health advocates and some congressional leaders have asked pointedly why the FDA, the nation's arbiter of drug safety, did not act sooner itself.", "Galson said that his agency met often with Merck to discuss earlier troubling Vioxx studies, and said that ``we insisted that we needed more information about the cardiovascular risks.", "'' In 2001, the agency formally warned the company against misleading doctors about those risks, and in 2002, the FDA required stiffer wording on the drug label.", "Nonetheless, the agency had agreed with Merck that the 2000 study had too many confounding aspects to be definitive.", "The national adverse event reporting system that helps the FDA flag dangerous side effects was of little use in

coached.", "By the time the meetings broke off in August 2004, the two had engaged in sexual activities more than 50 times, the girl, now 17, told Tampa police.", "They would meet in Wallace's car, in her Tampa Palms apartment, and near a running trail at the University of South Florida, the girl said.", "\"The student was convinced the two of them were in love,\" said Tampa police spokeswoman Laura McElroy.", "Wallace, 28, was charged this week with one count of lewd and lascivious battery, a second-degree felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison.", "State law makes it illegal for anyone 24 or older to engage in sexual activity with a person under 18.", "Wallace posted $7,500 bail within hours of her arrest and left the county jail Monday afternoon.", "Her attorney, Joe Bodiford of Tampa, said his client maintains her innocence.", "\"We're going to have tons of people come forward to give glowing reviews about her and her coaching,\" he said.", "The arrest is the

she had an affair with a student, is scheduled to stand trial in December on two counts of lewd and lascivious battery.", "Like Lafave, Wallace was newly married at the time of the alleged

questions from Wharton officials in the spring.", "\"The victim denied it.", "The victim's mother said this didn't happen,\" said school district spokesman Stephen Hegarty.", "\"Everybody who would know about this said it wasn't happening.", "\" Kansas State University professor Bob Shoop, an expert witness in cases involving sexual abuse between teachers and students, said students usually

guilty about the lies.", "Detectives started interviewing fellow students, including the player's sister.", "The sister told detective Melanee Holder that she found a \"love note\" from Wallace in the back of her sister's pants pocket in 2003.", "She said she once saw the two lying naked on Wallace's bed.", "In August, the student's mother gave police notes she found, addressed to her daughter from fellow students.", "\"Is you the first girl she messed with?", "\" one girl wrote.", "\"You my dawg and I love you NO MATTER WHAT, but I think coach should be punished!", "\" The student said Wallace ended the relationship in August 2004 because she wanted to have children and felt guilty about betraying her husband, Craig Wallace, a math teacher and girls soccer coach at Wharton.", "She married Wallace, a native of Jamaica, in a ceremony conducted June 7, 2003, by the Rev.", "Susan Baron at St. Andrew's United Methodist Church in Brandon, according to county records.", "She joked with some players that Craig Wallace, 28, was suspicious of her relationship with team members, former student and player Nikki Kelley told police.", "McElroy said detectives have found no evidence of other victims.", "Wallace graduated from the University of Tampa in May 1999 and has been at Wharton since the 1999-2000 school year, when she started as a substitute teacher.", "She became varsity basketball coach in spring 2003, after having coached the junior varsity team.", "Under Wallace, Wharton had one of the county's top programs.", "Last season, the Wildcats won their district, finished 21-8 and reached the second round of the Class 5A playoffs, where they were defeated by Haines City, 62-57.", "The previous season, Wharton went 23-8 with a district title and state playoff appearance.", "Wallace isn't coaching or teaching this year.", "Hegarty said she was transferred to the school district's Office of Professional Standards, where she has no contact with students.",

Tuesday to a plea deal that will keep the former Greco Middle School teacher out of prison.", "\"I couldn't imagine sitting there and looking at my son and then looking at him surrounded by the whole courtroom as well as looking at Lafave talking about things that shouldn't have happened to him,\" the mother said.", "Her name is being withheld to protect her son's identity.", "\"It would come out and be written about again and again and again in all of the media.", "At what point would he have had a normal life in high school, much less be tagged with it the rest of his life?", "\" Nearly 18 months after her case sent the tabloids into a tizzy, Lafave, 25, pleaded guilty to two counts of lewd and lascivious battery as part of a plea agreement with prosecutors in Hillsborough and Marion County.", "Under the terms of the deal, Hillsborough Circuit Judge Wayne Timmerman sentenced her to three years of house arrest and seven years' probation.", "The last-minute move spared Lafave the possibility of as much as 30 years in prison and saved her victim, who was 14 when the sexual encounters occurred, from the crush of a media frenzy.", "As part of the agreement, Lafave will also plead guilty to three sex charges in Marion County, including one count of lewd and lascivious exhibition.", "Hillsborough prosecutor Mike Sinacore said media attention played a big part in the state's decision to head back to the bargaining table.", "He reached a deal with Lafave attorney John Fitzgibbons shortly before the two were due back in court to argue over a gag order Timmerman imposed last week.", "On Tuesday, the victim was set to answer attorney questions at a formal deposition.", "But early that morning, Sinacore asked a judge for a meeting in his chambers to discuss a possible resolution.", "Several tense minutes later, the plea deal was announced.", "\"The victim's family indicated they wanted this case over with,\" Sinacore said.", "The announcement sent a ripple through the courtroom as reporters hurriedly scribbled in note pads and scrambled for cell phones.", "But the room fell silent as Lafave stepped to the podium to face her punishment.", "\"I want to apologize to the court and to the young man involved and his family for my actions.", "I accept full responsibility for my actions and I'm very sorry,\" Lafave said.", "Now classified as a sex offender, the former teacher can no longer work with or near children and cannot live within 1,000 feet of a school, church or playground.", "She will have a 10 p.m. curfew.", "She must undergo psychological therapy for four years and submit to a polygraph test once a year to verify that she is abiding by the rules.", "If she successfully completes her first two years on house arrest, also known as community control, a judge could waive her last year of home confinement.", "\"It allows the young man involved here to go on with his life, just as Debbie can go on with her life.", "He does not have to go through depositions and a trial,\" Fitzgibbons said.", "Sinacore said he had pressed for three years' prison time during plea negotiations early this year.", "Those negotiations foundered in October.", "For months afterward, the victim's family held fast to the idea that Lafave should do time.", "But in the weeks leading up to the high-profile trial, the fortitude of the family seemed to wane.", "Although the teenager had agreed to detail the relationship on the witness stand, it was unclear how his testimony about his feelings for Lafave might impact a jury, Sinacore said.", "\"He did not from the get go want to harm Debra Lafave.", "This was someone that he liked,\" Sinacore said.", "In the end, the boy's mother decided not to gamble on a trial and to save her son the

Tuesday afternoon after the State Attorney's Office released hundreds of pages of documents that could have been aired at trial.", "The papers include interviews with Lafave's former husband, Kristian Owen Lafave, 27, as well as a woman she dated in high school and a co-worker.", "Some supported Fitzgibbons' claims about her battle with mental illness and the trauma she suffered when she was raped at 13.", "Lafave's former East Bay High schoolmate and lover, Casie Diana Martinez, told prosecutors that the teenage Lafave had struggled with her sexuality and self-image.", "\"Really, that was from her mom pressuring her to a music career and trying to fit that mold of being thin, being a star, you know, fitting that role of being on stage,\" Martinez said.", "Last year, Lafave's attorney said he planned to raise an insanity defense.", "A psychologist hired by the state concluded Lafave was sane when she had sex with the boy.", "But several psychiatrists have since evaluated her and several, Fitzgibbons said, determined that trauma she suffered after she was raped at 13 and her subsequent mental illness may have led her to actions.", "\"If we were at trial, the doctors would be explaining how trauma over the years has affected Debbie.", "These traumatic events have an effect on her bi-polar illness.", "It was my feeling that any juror who listened to the testimony of all the difficulties Debbie has gone through would have found it a very sad and compelling story,\" Fitzgibbons said.", "As in the case of Mary Kay Letourneau, the Washington state school teacher who had a baby with a 13-year-old student, Lafave's case has generated much scrutiny.", "Pundits and reporters across the country have picked through every last detail, from her recent divorce to a judge's decision barring access to police photos of her genitals.", "All along her attorney has turned the spotlight to his advantage.", "He nearly lost that strategic edge last week when Timmerman issued a gag order barring attorneys on both sides from talking publicly about Lafave.", "But Fitzgibbons said the temporary ruling would not have stopped the runaway train of attention aimed at the client he once hinted was too pretty for prison.", "\"If Debbie was not considered attractive by almost every societal standard,\" he said, \"no one would have been paying any attention to this case.", "\"

states, making 2004 the worst year for grizzly mortality since the animal was added to the endangered species list in 1975.", "The death rate here, where the grizzly population is estimated at 600, was 2 1/2 half times greater than the 15-year average.", "Most worrying to wildlife biologists was the fact that females made up 60 percent of the dead.", "Nonetheless, the U.S.", "Fish and Wildlife Service is preparing to remove Yellowstone's grizzly bears from the endangered species list later this year.", "Moreover, new management plans might allow hunting of the bears outside the park.", "The Yellowstone contingent is the largest of a handful of remnant grizzly populations in the lower 48 states and the only one facing imminent removal from the endangered species list.", "Their range encompasses Yellowstone, Grand Teton National Park and nearby lands in Wyoming, Montana and Idaho.", "The law protects the bears in Yellowstone, part of Grand Teton and in a circle of land outside, known as the ``primary recovery area.", "'' A formidable symbol of American wilderness, and a hugely popular public attraction in Yellowstone, the grizzly bear would be the biggest animal to come off the endangered species list since the California gray whale was delisted in 1994.", "Despite the record number of dead bears last year, the Fish and Wildlife Service believes the grizzlies, whose population has more than doubled in the three decades it has been on the list, no longer need the special protection afforded by the law.", "``We're victims of our own success,'' said Chris Servheen, Fish and Wildlife's grizzly bear coordinator.", "``The bears are expanding their numbers and their range.", "They are now in places they haven't been in 80 or 100 years.", "These mortality rates are to be expected when bears punch out into areas where there are more people.", "'' But Servheen stresses the bears will be monitored closely after they are delisted.", "If their numbers drop below 500, a management review will be triggered.", "An overall decline of more than 4 percent or a 1.2 percent annual drop in the female population will trigger a review, Servheen said, and that could lead to an emergency re-lisiting.", "Bear experts believe that an isolated population of fewer than 500 is in danger of losing its genetic diversity and becoming vulnerable to disease and birth defects.", "Some biologists, notably Dave Mattson, a specialist on population assessment who has been studying the Yellowstone grizzlies since 1979, are wary of managing by numbers.", "``We really don't have any precise ways to count bears or track their growth and decline,'' Mattson said.", "``Even if you start with 500 bears, an annual decline of 2 percent to 5 percent over 15 to 30 years could take them down to 200.", "'' According to estimates at the time, there were between 150 and 220 Yellowstone grizzlies when they were placed on the endangered species list.", "Mattson, who works for the U.S. Geological Survey, said he has not taken a position on delisting, but he worries that not enough is known about comparatively new threats such as climate change and the proliferation of non-native species that could deplete some of the bears' food sources by 90 percent in the future.", "Some opponents of delisting contend that last year's mortality rate underscores the bear's vulnerability to encroaching development.", "They contend that once exempt from the highest level of federal protection, the bears will be safe only inside Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks, areas too small to sustain a viable population of grizzlies.", "In 2001, the Bush administration shelved a plan to reintroduce grizzlies in a wilderness area along the Idaho-Montana border, despite strong public sentiment in favor of the move.", "Many experts believed it would have been a major step in assuring the long-term survival of grizzlies because the isolated Yellowstone bears would have been able to intermingle with the introduced population.", "How the Yellowstone bears fare could well be the most conspicuous test case of the Bush administration's policy toward endangered species.", "The administration wants to reform the Endangered Species Act to make it harder to add to the list and easier to remove species from it.", "It also wants to make it harder to set aside ``critical habitat'' -- in effect, wildlife sanctuaries covering millions of acres where commercial and industrial development is restricted.", "Even if the Yellowstone grizzlies are delisted, federal and state officials point out that protections will remain in place on more than 9,200 square miles of the grizzlies' core habitat in the parks and adjacent federal lands.", "But about 2 million acres of federal and private land where about one-third of the bears are believed to live will be more open to logging, recreation and development.", "That concerns Louisa Willcox, who heads the Montana-based Wild Bear Project for the Natural Resources Defense Council.", "The new plans don't allow for a fallback when food sources in bear habitat diminish or change, said Wilcox who has worked for conservation causes in Wyoming and Montana for more than 20 years.", "(Begin optional trim) In the 19th century, an estimated 50,000 grizzlies roamed across one-third of the Continental United States.", "Now, an estimated 1,200 bears occupy 2 percent of their original land base.", "Wandering grizzlies can terrorize rural neighborhoods, chew up a rancher's calves and occasionally maul people.", "In Yellowstone Park, about 30 people have been injured and two killed in bear attacks since 1975.", "Much has changed in the mountains and forested valleys of the Yellowstone region since the bears were placed on the endangered species.", "Some counties bordering the park have grown by nearly 30 percent.", "Traditional conflicts between bears and livestock are compounded by exurban sprawl creeping up open valleys across the intermountain West.", "Today, when a grizzly fords a stream to forage, it can find itself confronted with an obstacle course of swing sets and patio furniture.", "(End optional trim) The burgeoning ranchettes outside of Cody along the North and South Fork of the Shoshone River are in prime bear habitat.", "One, a high-end development of about 150 homes, will be the county's first gated community.", "Charles Preston, the curator of Cody's Buffalo Bill Historic Center, is developing educational programs that teach about bear-human conflicts.", "Preston, an ornithologist, says folks here are not quite at the ``torch and pitchfork stage'' in response to the grizzly, but there is concern.", "''We happen to live in the last great place.", "It's a cliche, but its true,`` he said.", "''The Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem is the last intact predator ecosystem in the world, with the full complement of wildlife that existed at the time of Christopher Columbus.", "It's a vignette of pristine America.", "'' Preston envisions a program that helps residents to embrace the region and all of its wildlife, enough to be moved to protect it.", "It will be a tough sell in some places, especially in counties where the bears have been scarce until recent years.", "Last month, commissioners in Fremont County, southeast of Yellowstone declared the bears ``socially unacceptable.", "'' In all, four Wyoming county commissions have passed anti-grizzly resolutions.", "Servheen of the Fish and Wildlife Service who is a strong advocate of delisting the Yellowstone grizzlies dismissed the resolutions as ''colorful but meaningless,`` saying that ''a majority of people want bears around.`` But Wilcox pointed out that in Wyoming county resolutions have the force of law and could trigger a rash of grizzly killings once the federal government has ceded authority over the animals to the states.", "Before delisting can occur, state and federal agencies in Wyoming, Montana and Idaho must establish bear management plans.", "While the plans are in various stages of development, the states are expected to authorize grizzly hunting for the fist time in decades, although it would not be allowed in the national parks.", "Even with the strict protections now afforded by the Endangered Species Act, grizzlies can be destroyed if they kill domestic livestock or make a nuisance of themselves in areas where people live.", "Bears also have died after being shot by hunters claiming self-defense or saying they mistook a grizzly for a black bear.", "Some experts make the case that legal hunting will bolster support for the grizzlies' survival.", "''In some ways I see hunting of grizzly bears in the future as positive tool,`` said Kim Barber, the U.S. Forest Service's grizzly bear and wolf coordinator for the Rocky Mountain region.", "''The only way the bear is going to survive in the Yellowstone Ecosystem is to have public support for it.", "Hunting will help.`` But Chuck Neal, an ecologist and bear expert retired from the U.S. Bureau of Land Management in Wyoming, said an anti-bear hysteria drives the hunting discussion He's particularly concerned that state and local officials -- susceptible to citizen pressure -- will establish bear management plans that permit bear killing in a broad array of circumstances.", "''They are the kind of people whose idea of wildlife management is to kill anything that looks at them crossways.", "It's a 19th-century approach,`` Neal said.", "''I don't support state control of the grizz.", "I fear bears are headed into a wall of lead.`` "]}, {"headline": "Nine-year study shows grizzlies near Canadian park have lowest birth rate ever in North America", "id":

backing the delisting of the grizzly bear, other environmental groups including the Sierra Club and the Natural Resource Defense Council are opposed and threaten to sue the federal government to block the move.", "Once Endangered Species Act protections are removed, a host of new safeguards will ensure grizzly populations will not decline, Servheen said.", "For example, new roads will be banned in national forests around the park, Servheen said.", "State and federal agencies will monitor the bears and their habitat and responsibility for managing bears will be turned over to Montana, Idaho and Wyoming.", "If bear numbers drop, the population could be returned to the endangered species list, Servheen added.", "The fact that the bears have rebounded, critics say, doesn't necessarily mean they are recovered.", "Female grizzlies mate only every second or third year.", "Only the shaggy musk ox -- like the bear a relic of the Ice Age -- breeds more slowly.", "That means if grizzly deaths spike, it could tip the species into an \"extinction vortex,\" said Michael Scott, director of the Greater Yellowstone Coalition.", "\"You cannot take the second-slowest reproducing species in North America, manage it on a knife-edge and expect that in the long term it will survive,\" Scott said.", "\"Nature will always throw you a curve.", "\" The combination of blister rust and the beetle outbreak is such a curve.", "About 24 percent of Yellowstone area whitebarks were found to be infected with rust in a 2004 Forest Service survey.", "\"The history of blister rust is clear: it spreads and intensifies,\" said Diana Tomback, a professor at the University of Colorado at Denver who directs the Whitebark Pine Ecosystem Foundation.", "\"I am very fearful about the future of the whitebark pine.", "\" Some whitebarks have genetic resistance to blister rust.", "By identifying those trees and cultivating their seeds, researchers hope to grow new rust-resistant forests in the future.", "Whitebarks, however, have no defense against the invading mountain pine beetles, which have exploded into Yellowstone.", "Federal bear biologists contend the rust is moving more slowly in Yellowstone than in northwest Montana and that the trees have co-evolved with mountain pine beetles for thousands of years.", "\"We don't know if whitebark pine will decline,\" said Chuck Schwartz, a U.S. Geological Survey researcher leading the Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team.", "Forest pathologists take a much different view.", "\"A lot of trees are going to be killed,\" said John Schwandt, national whitebark pine coordinator for the Forest Service.", "\"A lot of the seeds that grizzly bears really like are going to be greatly reduced, and not over decades but in the next 10 years,\" Schwandt said.", "Federal managers contend the bears eat just about anything around Yellowstone, including grasses, roots, ants, miller moths, trout and elk.", "\"We're not saying things will always be stable,\" said Servheen.", "\"We're saying we'll be able to respond to changes to make sure the bear's OK.\" In late summer and fall, grizzly bears follow an urge to gorge in order to store enough fat to survive hibernation, a condition called hyperphagy.", "A 350-pound female needs to average 18,000 kilocalories, or the equivalent of 30 Big Macs a day, according to Mattson.", "Big males and sows with cubs need even more food.", "Given a chance, the bears will even eat the trash.", "Until the 1970s, watching dump-diving grizzlies was a popular attraction at Yellowstone.", "When the dumps were closed, hungry bears invaded park campgrounds and more than 225 had to be killed.", "That, critics of delisting say, serves as a cautionary tale.", "There are already fewer native cutthroat trout swimming up spawning streams, where bears hunt them, because they're being gobbled up in Yellowstone Lake by illegally introduced lake trout.", "In years when whitebarks naturally produce fewer nuts, more Yellowstone grizzlies move to the park's edges, where they find hunters' elk carcasses.", "Foraging on the edge of the park is dangerous for bears because that's where people live.", "Humans are responsible for 85 percent of Yellowstone bear deaths, said Schwartz.", "At least 25 bears died in the greater Yellowstone area last year, including eight breeding-age females killed by people.", "In fact, the six-year average of female bear deaths exceeded the maximum allowed by the recovery plan in 2004 and 2005, according to federal data.", "The deaths fall within new mortality limits that are based on more thorough population estimates now being substituted for the old ones, federal managers say.", "Dealing with bears near the recovery zone boundary will be the toughest challenge for state and federal biologists, Schwartz said.", "Problem bears have to be removed quickly so the public will accept living with the rest.", "\"The Yellowstone ecosystem has a fixed amount of habitat,\" Schwartz said.", "\"Once bears fill that habitat, the excess bears will probably wind up where they don't belong and are going to die.", "\" Grizzlies don't recognize recovery area boundaries, forest management plans or endangered species politics.", "All they care about is finding food -- a lot of it.", "And the reddish crowns of dying whitebark pines continue to advance across Yellowstone.", "This summer, Tom Reed, a former Wyoming Game and Fish spokesman, rode horseback through dead whitebark stands in Yellowstone that were healthy just three years ago.", "\"As a guy on the ground, I

list.", "The spike in grizzly killing is concentrated here in a rapidly growing, spectacularly scenic but culturally disjointed corner of the West.", "Affluent outsiders have overrun Flathead County

comeback of the grizzlies, estimated at between 500 and 800 bears, has gained momentum.", "Grizzlies now frequent areas where they had not been seen for at least two decades.", "Lack of investigative

environmentalists, highlights the contrasting views of the 32-year-old Endangered Species Act.", "Proponents of the government's move say the grizzly's recovery marks a rare victory for the controversial law; others say the decision may undermine protections for a still-vulnerable group of animals.", "If the administration goes ahead with dropping the bears' current ``threatened'' status -- a move that would not take place until the end of 2006 at the earliest -- officials in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming would be free to allow limited hunting of grizzlies and would not have to maintain the same level of protection on the grizzlies' habitat.", "The government would continue to monitor how state and federal authorities manage the land where the bears live to ensure their survival.",

in 1982 to more than 600 today, ``recovered.", "'' He added that federal biologists have informed him ``adequate habitat and adequate habitat protections are in place'' for the bears.", "``We know

growing at a rate of 4 to 7 percent a year for several years -- in part because state and federal officials abolished trash dumps that used to lure bears and bring them into dangerous contact with humans.", "But the recent revival has also sparked conflict with nearby residents as the bears venture out of the national park.", "Dominic Domenici, the Fish and Wildlife Service resident agent in charge of enforcement for Montana and Wyoming, said there ``are more conflicts now between elk hunters and bears,'' in part because the whitebark pine seeds grizzlies need are in shorter supply now due to a beetle infestation induced by warming climate.", "Some environmentalists say the decline of whitebark pine is yet another reason why the grizzlies should remain listed as threatened, since the seeds are closely linked to female bears' fecundity.", "But National Wildlife Federation senior wildlife biologist Sterling Miller, who spent 21 years studying grizzlies in Alaska, said the time has come to take Yellowstone's bears off the list.", "``You can't immunize them against everything bad that can possibly happen,'' Miller said.", "``That's a prescription for a permanent listing.",

dollars helping promote the bears' recovery.", "While the state plans to allow hunting ``as a management tool,'' he added, officials would ensure it does not hurt the grizzly population, and hunting

ended in 1975.", "Then they had children.", "The area where they fought had been heavily sprayed with the herbicide Agent Orange in a wide-ranging, decade-long campaign by the United States to deprive its enemy of forest cover and food crops.", "Officials here are convinced that the five teen-agers _ along with tens of thousands of other deformed children of war veterans and exposed civilians _ are the victims of the herbicide and its poisonous residue, dioxin.", "Reunions like the one in the hospital are not uncommon, the officials say.", "But Vietnam's scientific studies have been sketchy and its evidence is often anecdotal.", "Until there is firm proof that chemical herbicides are to blame, the United States says it cannot take responsibility.", "Vietnam has raised the issue only glancingly in talks with the United States, said Ambassador Douglas Peterson.", "But it arises repeatedly among people here who say it is one of the most painful remnants of a war that ended 24 years ago.", "In a country where Americans are generally welcomed with friendship, the absence of aid from the United States for deformed children is one issue that still rankles.", "It is a subject that the government-controlled press keeps alive with occasional reports and that is sometimes placed on the agendas of foreign delegations, who are shown shelves full of glass bottles with labels like ``Deformed baby with two heads, one body.", "'' ``You talk so much about human rights and humanity,'' said Dr.", "Le Cao Dai, who runs the Agent Orange program of the Vietnamese Red Cross.", "``No

Western-based scientists, we can hardly recommend less be done in Vietnam.", "'' The study was careful not to draw conclusions about the contentious question of human victims of the chemical spraying.", "But David Levy, vice president and senior scientist of Hatfield, said in an interview that logic would suggest that there were victims.", "Over the years, tests conducted by Vietnamese and foreign researchers in certain localities here have documented high levels of contamination of breast milk and blood.", "Though the methodology may not be as rigorous as that in more-developed

these children are innocent of the war.", "They are a generation of victims who are the children of victims.", "'' The chance reunion of the children of battlefield comrades included Nguyen Thi Thoa, 15, whose body is covered with black blotches and whose younger brother died of heart disease.", "Hien described the blotches simply as a melanin disorder and said: ``It is a very serious case.", "We are confused about how to treat it.", "'' Sitting by her were two sisters, Nguyen Thi Thuong, 15, and Nguyen Thi Khuyen, 13, both of whom have mild mental retardation and whose growth has been severely stunted.", "Hien said the sisters' father had been unable to bear their ailments and had fled their home.", "After their mother brought them to live at the hospital, the doctor said, the parents reunited and had another baby, who was also born deformed.", "That story is not unusual, said Dai of the Red Cross.", "Parents often consider such births to be punishments for their sins and keep trying for healthy children, only to produce more sick ones.", "In some cases, the parents are ostracized by fellow villagers for these presumed sins and exiled to live at the edges of rice

begin to fall, forcing Dai to move his hospital deeper into the forest for concealment.", "Only later did he come to believe that the spraying had done long-term health damage to Vietnamese soldiers and civilians.", "That belief is shared by leading Vietnamese doctors who were interviewed on a recent trip through Vietnam.", "None would hazard a guess to this writer as to how extensive the damage had been, but one was later quoted in the Vietnamese press as asserting that some 70,000 Vietnamese are now suffering from illnesses caused by Agent Orange.", "The evidence to support these beliefs is weak, for it is a sad irony of the Vietnam War that those most likely to have been affected by the spraying _ the Vietnamese themselves _ have been the least effectively studied.", "The United States has put enormous effort into assessing possible harm to American soldiers but found only limited damage, perhaps because most soldiers had relatively little contact with the chemicals during their short tours of duty.", "Meanwhile, the Vietnamese troops directly under the spray and civilians who lived in the sprayed areas for years or moved in later, have been studied primarily by Vietnamese scientists whose results are not generally accepted by scientists from more advanced nations.", "American herbicides, of which the most prominent was Agent Orange, were widely dispersed to defoliate trees over supply routes, clear away brush from roadsides, riverbanks and base camps, and kill food crops that sustained guerrilla bands.", "More than 10 percent of the land area of South Vietnam was sprayed at least once, and some areas were sprayed repeatedly.", "The herbicides themselves would generally dissipate within weeks but would leave behind a toxic contaminant, dioxin, that was inadvertently created during the manufacturing process.", "Journalists who inquire about Agent Orange are routinely taken to ``peace villages'' to see malformed children, to an exhibit on health consequences at the medical school in Hanoi or to a collection of malformed fetuses at an obstetrical hospital in Ho Chi Minh City.", "All three sites make a powerful case that there is appalling illness in Vietnam, but all fall short of demonstrating that Agent Orange was the culprit.", "The birth defects, cancers and other illnesses that the Vietnamese attribute to Agent Orange can be caused by a wide range of factors, and Agent Orange may not be prominent among them.", "The epidemiological and laboratory studies that offer the best hope of teasing out answers are difficult for even the most advanced scientific countries to perform.", "Vietnamese studies that purport to find excess cancers, birth defects and other illnesses in soldiers and civilians from areas that were sprayed are discounted by Western experts for lack of stringent methodology.", "Vietnamese and American scientists once started a collaborative research effort, but it fell apart three years ago when Vietnamese authorities confiscated research samples before they could leave the country.", "Now, however, the Vietnamese and the American Embassy in Hanoi are both suggesting a joint study of the effects of the herbicides.", "The U.S. National Academy of Sciences has been asked to consider whether it is feasible to do a study so long after the spraying, in a nation where health records and disease measures are notoriously incomplete.", "The research seems well worth doing, if it is technically feasible.", "An authoritative study would add to the growing literature on the health effects of herbicides and dioxin, could help the Vietnamese decide how to allocate scarce health resources and might shed additional light on the effects of Agent Orange in American veterans.", "Most compelling of all, it

disaster.", "He said the pilot had mentioned a problem with the plane's air-conditioning system before losing contact.", "But other experts said a sudden loss of pressurization would not have caused

enforcement agency and that he had not been under surveillance.", "Before fleeing, the man left a note on the body of the victim, said Eric Vermeulen, a spokesman for the Amsterdam police.", "The police declined to describe the contents of the message.", "The Dutch news media reported that it contained passages from the Quran.", "Van Gogh, 47, a distant relative of the 19th century painter

extremists, many were left wondering what happened to the Netherlands' famed tolerance and fear a society deeply divided.", "\"The murder could be the start of a spiral in which different communities come to view each other as enemies,\" the Christian Trouw daily warned Wednesday.", "Theo van Gogh, who had received threats over a controversial film he made about Islam, was shot and stabbed to death Tuesday while cycling on an Amsterdam street.", "His alleged assailant, identified as having dual Dutch and Moroccan nationality, was arrested shortly after the attack.", "Public prosecutor Leo de Wit told a news conference in Amsterdam that the motive was believed to have been his radical Islamic views, basing the assumption on the content of two papers, one stuck on the dagger used to attack the director, the other found on the suspected killer during a search.", "The judicial authorities declined to give further information on the content of the papers, with the prosecutor declining to confirm a report that the one found on the suspect's body was a farewell letter.", "The suspect is being held in isolation and cannot receive anybody except his lawyer.", "Late Tuesday Dutch Interior Minister Johan Remkes said the suspect had ties with Islamic extremists in the Netherlands but did not belong to the hard core group of some 150 extremists being monitored by the intelligence services.", "Amsterdam police chief Bernard Welten said late Wednesday that a total of eight men aged between 19 and 27 had been arrested in connection with the murder.", "They were six Moroccans, one Algerian and a man having dual Moroccan and Spanish citizenship.", "The arrests were made after police searched five apartments and seized computer equipment and fundamentalist writings.", "All eight people had already been arrested for suspected terrorist activities in October 2003 but were later released.", "Van Gogh's killer was said to have had contacts with the group and allegedly stayed at each of the five homes searched.", "By Wednesday night some 100 witnesses had been questioned by police.", "After it became known that van Gogh's alleged killer was of Moroccan descent, politicians and commentators feared ethnic tensions and called for calm.", "Later Wednesday an Internet condolence register set up for van Gogh was closed down because it was flooded with racist remarks.", "Van Gogh, 47, was widely known for his outspoken criticism of Islam and recently caused uproar with a short film linking domestic abuse with the perceived subservient position of women in the Islamic faith.", "Van Gogh, the great great nephew of 19th-century Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh, was a staunch critic of multicultural society as a whole.", "Many Jewish organisation branded him an anti-Semite and he was generally known as a arch provocateur.", "Out of a population of 16 million the Netherlands has some 900,000 Muslims and of those some 300,000 are of Moroccan descent.", "In the Moroccan community there is a growing fear that they will be singled out for revenge.", "\"Everybody is shocked by the murder.", "On the other hand ... there are people who wonder if there will be a war against Moroccans,\" Abdou Menabi, chairman of the Urban Assembly of Moroccans in Amsterdam said, voicing the concerns of many.", "At a short memorial gathering for Van Gogh in Amsterdam, attended by some 20,000 people, many Muslims showed up especially to demonstrate that they condemned the killing.", "Ikram, a 31-year-old mother, came to the rally with a sign saying 'Muslims against violence'.", "\"I was debating whether or not to come, but I decided that as a Muslim and as a Moroccan I should take up my responsibility to show that we do not support this act,\" she told AFP.", "On Wednesday many papers compared the killing of van Gogh to the assassination of rightwing populist politician Pim Fortuyn on May 6, 2002.", "Both men had outspoken views on Islam and many other issues and were always trying passionately to stir public debate.", "\"After Pim Fortuyn, another person has been killed who held strong views on controversial issues and did not hide them,\" the popular daily Algemeen Dagblad said.", "\"A mass demonstration of Dutch Muslims could be the symbolic start of a necessary cleansing,\" it suggested.", "In Amsterdam several Moroccan organisations held a protest rally.", "Van Gogh's film production company announced Wednesday that he would be cremated next week Tuesday in a memorial service open to the public.

and grand juries.", "``Alex has gotten what many people feel he didn't have _ extremely competent grand jury prosecutors, prosecutors with a great depth of homicide experience,'' Bob Grant, district attorney for Adams County, said Tuesday.", "Noting that he had lent his chief trial deputy, Bruce Levin, to the case, Grant added, ``There really isn't any way to predict how long an investigative grand jury will go on.", "'' As the grand jury has proved leak proof and as the murder case has grown cold, interest among news organizations has tapered off.", "``Starting in January 1997, at least

Sought.", "'' Five members of the Ramseys' extended family agreed to give Boulder police palm prints and DNA samples last week.", "As part of the ongoing investigation, detectives reportedly are trying to identify a mystery palm print found in the Ramsey basement and stray bits of DNA found under the little girl's fingernails.", "Knowing that unidentified DNA could bolster the theory that his daughter was murdered by a mysterious intruder, Ramsey wrote in a public letter Sept. 28: ``We have been told that the authorities have your DNA.", "They will know it is you.", "'' ``If the DNA is not identified, it does weaken the prosecution's case,'' said Scott Robinson, a Denver defense lawyer who follows the case for several Denver news outlets.", "JonBenet's parents have already provided police with DNA samples, largely snippets of hair.", "The five family members who were scheduled to provide samples last week all have alibis placing them far from Boulder on the night of the murder.

length.", "The Ramseys have agreed to continue to cooperate and to provide certain documents.", "'' In addition, investigators from Hunter's office traveled two weeks ago to the Ramsey's new home in

the night of the murder, 18 months ago.", "Although the Ramsey's have long declined to be interviewed by police, whom they characterized as biased in the case, their attorney said recently the couple would cooperate with the grand jury.", "A new grand jury was impaneled here two months ago.", "Early this month, Boulder police spent two days detailing the case to Hunter.", "At the end of the closed-door sessions, Hunter indicated that he would decide whether or not to call a grand jury by early July.", "On Thursday, he said: ``I do not know when I will make this decision.", "'' On

head off grand jury appearances later this summer.", "When talking with prosecutors, the Ramseys are not under oath, can refuse to answer questions, can benefit from considerable advice from their defense attorneys, and can avoid running a media gauntlet to enter a courthouse.", "These conditions do not generally apply in a grand jury setting.", "``You only use a grand jury to compel evidence:

By contrast, reefs off Mauritius, where waters remained cooler, had fewer symbiont D algae.", "They resembled the reefs of the Red Sea, Baker said.", "Baker said these findings, reported in the journal Nature in August, suggested that when corals lost algae in a bleaching event, heat-tolerant algae could move in to replace them.", "Symbiont D \"is becoming more common on reefs that are experiencing bleaching events,\" Baker said.", "He said the findings were the first \"real-world evidence\" that corals might adapt to warming.", "But this kind of adaptation may not be enough \"to let corals off the hook,\" as Knowlton of the Scripps Institution put it in an interview.", "For example, according to a report issued this month by the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network, scientists do not know exactly what conditions must exist for corals to acquire new strains of algae.", "They do not even know if changes occur when corals recruit different algae from the water around them, or if something somehow changes the ratio of algae strains growing within them.", "Also, Knowlton said, it is not yet known whether corals colonized with new varieties of algae will grow as well as they once did with other strains.", "For example, she said, it could be that heat-tolerant algae strains devote more of their energy to reproducing and less to providing sustenance to their coral hosts.", "And though symbiont D is widespread among the world's corals, Knowlton said, scientists do not know whether all of them can support the strain.", "Answers to those questions await more research, and she said the study of corals was still developing.", "\"If it were birds it would be 18th- or 19th-century science -- who's living with whom, where,\" she said.", "History suggests that the coral bleaching and mortality associated with the severe El Nino phenomenon of 1997-98 was a thousand-year event, according to the monitoring network's coral report.", "That means, in theory, that there is only a 1-in-1,000 chance that similar effects would be seen in a given year.", "But, the report says, evidence strongly suggests that global warming will turn severe bleaching into \"a regular event\" by the middle of the century.", "So evidence of coral recovery since 1998 is encouraging, the report says.", "\"Some people would argue that global climate change is their biggest long-term threat,\" Knowlton said, \"and it's the one we have the least ability to do anything about.", "So good news on the global warming front is very welcome.", "\" About half the reefs that were left badly damaged after the 1997-98 El Nino event have bounced back, Baker said.", "\"So even from a major event there can be recovery,\" he said, if overfishing, habitat destruction and other

many of these fish.", "And the beaches of Sri Lanka, the Andaman and Nicobar islands, and other countries hit by the tsunami host prime nesting spots for some of the world's rarest sea turtles, such

the giant waves were barely noticeable.", "Land animals may have had the same \"sixth sense\" to move to safety: Wildlife officials in Sri Lanka's Yala National Park said they have not seen evidence that many animals died, despite the preserve's closeness to the ocean.", "Scientists don't have comprehensive historical data about marine damage that tsunamis can cause, especially one of this magnitude.", "They do know that in 1883, when the Krakatoa volcano exploded and sent a giant tsunami washing over Indonesia, coral heads that weighed hundreds of tons were tossed hundreds of feet inland.", "And in 1964, when a tsunami hit Alaska, news reports noted that baby salmon were killed, although it's unclear how many.", "This week, dive operators and researchers began sending e-mails

dead coral and sand covering the runway at Hulule International Airport.", "In Sri Lanka and Thailand, coral damage is reported to be severe, and trees have crashed down onto reefs, ripping many of the corals, some hundreds of years old, apart.", "\"Many fish washed ashore, trees that were knocked down (smashed) into the reefs,\" Michiru Main, a researcher who was conducting a reef survey at Mu

probably been damaged, too, although it's far too early to get a complete picture.", "Some scientists this week said human activity in the coastal zone contributed to the immense damage on shore -- such as building tourist hotels too close to the water and tearing out mangrove forests to put in shrimp aquaculture farms throughout Asia.", "But others say that while the lack of mangrove forests probably exacerbated the destruction, it's unlikely that they would have slowed the tsunami's enormous volume of water.", "\"Maybe in East Africa where the waves weren't as high, but I'm not sure when

from the fringes of health care with an astonishing flourish and now shows clear signs of joining the medical mainstream.", "Despite many cautionary tales about adulterated and even dangerous products, herbs formulated as capsules, tinctures, extracts and teas _ and increasingly as additions to common foods like potato chips and fruit drinks _ are now routinely used by a third of American adults seeking to enhance their health or alleviate their illnesses.", "Each day the herbal realm wins new converts, particularly among those who have become disillusioned with the cost and consequences of traditional drugs, distrustful of conventional physicians and convinced that ``natural'' equals ``good.", "'' Yet, because herbal products are classified as dietary supplements, not drugs, and face none of the premarket hurdles drugs must clear, consumers have no assurance of safety or effectiveness.", "Indeed, scores of products sold in the United States are listed by European and American authorities as ineffective, unsafe or both, and manufacturing standards to assure high quality have been proposed but are not yet in force.", "Thus, countless consumers are wasting their money on useless products or jeopardizing their health on hazardous ones.", "Among the serious side effects that have been linked to herbal remedies are high blood pressure, life-threatening allergic reactions, heart rhythm abnormalities, mania, kidney failure and liver damage.", "A few widely available products, including sassafras and comfrey, contain known carcinogens.", "At the same time, according to a report last year in the journal Psychosomatics, unsuspecting consumers ``have used herbal remedies with good results only to discover that the benefit was actually derived from the presence of undisclosed medicines,'' including steroids, anti-inflammatory agents, sedatives and hormones.", "``The lack of quality standards is the No.", "1 problem in the whole industry,'' said Dr. Varro Tyler, emeritus professor of pharmacognosy (the study of active ingredients in plants) at Purdue University.", "Tyler, who has no financial connection to herbal products and is arguably the nation's leading independent expert on herbal medicine, said: ``I feel sorry for the typical consumer.", "How is he or she to know what is best, what products are reliable and safe?", "Even when a label says the product has been standardized, the consumer has no way to know if it actually meets that standard.", "'' And even if an herbal product has been reliably made in some standard dose, it does not mean that scientific studies have shown it to be effective.", "The industry itself is promoting a ``good manufacturing practices'' doctrine.", "Annette Dickinson, director of scientific and regulatory affairs for the Council for Responsible Nutrition, a trade organization for producers of dietary supplements, said a consortium of associations submitted a document of manufacturing standards to the Food and Drug Administration two years ago.", "Although such a standard would say nothing about an herb's safety or effectiveness, it would result in reliable methods that the industry would have to use to assure the identity and quality of its products.", "The agency has issued a notice of proposed rules but no final ruling as yet.", "Nonetheless, botanicals _ as herbal products are more accurately known _ are enjoying an annual retail market approaching $4 billion, up from $839 million in 1991 and growing about 18 percent a year.", "Hundreds of products formulated with virtually no government oversight are crowding shelves of health food stores, food markets and pharmacies nationwide.", "Supplements are also widely sold by marketers like Amway, through catalogs and on the Internet.", "Now, even major pharmaceutical companies like Warner Lambert, American Home Products, Bayer and SmithKline Beecham are introducing herbal products, adding respectability to this marginalized market.", "Some herbs _ like echinacea, goldenseal, American ginseng and wild yam _ have become so popular that their continued supply from natural sources is in danger.", "As the plants become scarcer and more expensive, products containing them are increasingly likely to be adulterated and may even contain none of the herb listed on the label.", "Peggy Brevoort, president of East Earth Herb Inc., a company in Eugene, Ore., that produces botanicals, said the demand for St. John's wort, used for mild depression, and kava, a calmative said to reduce anxiety, now exceeds their supply, introducing the ``danger of adulteration'' by ``unscrupulous dealers.", "'' At the same time, two major new publications _ a 1,244-page Physicians' Desk Reference for Herbal Medicines, produced by the same company that publishes the Physicians' Desk Reference, and an English-language edition of Germany's therapeutic guide to herbal medicines, The Complete German Commission E Monographs _ have been issued to help educate physicians, pharmacists and interested consumers about the known uses, proper dosages and safety concerns of more than 600 botanicals now sold in this country.", "The evaluations in both books are based on studies, most done in Germany and reviewed by teams of experts.", "Last month, the National Institutes of Health began listing on the Internet international bibliographic information on dietary supplements, including herbal products.", "The address is www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/IBIDS/.", "In addition, a few medical and pharmacology schools have recently introduced courses in phytomedicine, the study of botanicals.", "And next month the American Pharmaceutical Association will conduct a two-day program on herbal medicine as part of its annual meeting.", "Still, most doctors remain wary of botanicals, especially when patients choose self-medication with plant extracts over established medical remedies.", "nn The very act of Congress that has fostered this growth _ the 1994 Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act _ has also permitted chaos to reign in the botanical marketplace, with no mechanism to assure that products are safe or effective.", "Pushed heavily by Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, the home base of many supplement makers, and passed over the objections of the FDA, the law created a new product class, the dietary supplement, that was not subject to regulations applied to drugs.", "Now any substance that can be found in foods, regardless of amount or action and including substances that act as hormones or toxins, can be produced and sold without any premarket testing or agency approval.", "Marketed as neither a food nor a drug, herbal products are not obliged to meet any established standards of effectiveness or safety for medicinal products, which require extensive laboratory and clinical trials before approval.", "As with other substances classified as dietary supplements, the FDA can restrict the sale of an herbal product only if it receives well-documented reports of health problems associated with it.", "The agency took four years, and more than 100 reports of life-threatening symptoms and 38 deaths, to act against ephedra, often sold as the Chinese herb ma huang, a stimulant that can prove disastrous to people with heart problems.", "With FDA authority limited by the 1994 law, the Federal Trade Commission, which monitors advertising, has taken a more active role in monitoring supplement makers.", "The FTC last year took legal action against seven manufacturers that had broken rules requiring advertising be truthful and verifiable.", "The companies were selling remedies or purported cure-alls for ailments like impotence, cancer and obesity.", "The commission also sent e-mail warnings to 1,200 Internet sites that it said had made ``incredible claims'' for drugs, devices and supplements, including herbal remedies that would supposedly ward off AIDS.", "Also, the commission late last year issued its first set of advertising guidelines aimed specifically at the supplement industry.", "Still, the current regulations have created a quagmire of consumer confusion and set up potential health crises that even industry officials say could ultimately hurt producers as well as users of herbal products.", "Under the 1994 law, consumers have no assurance that an herbal product contains what the label says it does or that it is free from harmful contaminants.", "Independent analyses of some products, particularly those containing costly or scarce herbs, revealed that some have little or none of the purported active ingredient listed on the label.", "Adding to the confusion is that botanical makers are allowed to describe products only in terms of their effects on the structure or function of the body, not their potential health benefits.", "Thus, a product label might say ``promotes cardiac function'' but it cannot say ``lowers cholesterol.", "'' Likewise, although the law does allow health warnings on the label, most manufacturers have yet to include them.", "Consumers are warned, however, that federal drug safety officials are not watching the store.", "All botanicals must display a disclaimer on the label following the description of the product's structural or functional role: ``This statement has not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.", "This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease.", "'' To which Tyler commented, ``If that is true, why on earth would anyone use it?", "'' The seeds of the modern herbal market were sown in the '60s when ``green, organic and natural became buzzwords,'' Tyler said.", "But they did not mature until the '90s with the growing consumer interest in ``self-care and controlling one's destiny,'' he said.", "Many turned to herbs as a gentler way to treat health problems and a potential tool for preserving mental and physical health.", "The interest has spawned scores of Internet sites and hundreds of books on various herbs.", "But much of the literature is replete with poorly documented health claims and, with few exceptions (among them, Tyler's books), advocacy prevails over objectivity.", "Because plants contain a mixture of relatively diluted chemicals, they naturally tend to have milder actions, both in their therapeutic benefits and side effects, than the concentrated, single chemicals in most drugs.", "Thus, botanicals generally take longer to act than regular pharmaceuticals and few have the potency of a prescription, the one possible exception being saw palmetto, which a well-designed study indicated may be as helpful for an enlarged prostate as the more expensive and riskier drug, Proscar.", "The combination of chemicals in botanicals is potentially both a plus and a minus.", "When two or more chemicals enhance one another's activity, the therapeutic benefit could theoretically exceed that of an isolated substance formulated as a drug.", "Mark Blumenthal, who heads the American Botanical Council, noted that the herb St. John's wort, widely used in Germany and increasingly in the United States to counter mild depression, is standardized for a substance called hypericin.", "But, he explained, ``hypericin is not directly linked to its antidepressant activity.", "'' Rather, other substances in the herb seem to have diverse actions on brain chemicals, all of which work together to counter depression.", "Equally possible, though, when using an herb with two or more active chemicals, is that one will cancel the benefits of another or introduce a hazard.", "Without careful chemical tests and large, well-controlled clinical trials such actions are often hard to detect.", "Consumer confidence in herbal medicine is bolstered by the common but erroneous assumption that ``natural'' equals ``safe'' and the public's failure to realize that many plants contain chemicals that are potent drugs or outright poisons.", "Natural laxatives like the herb Cascara sagrada are just as habit-forming and harmful to the colon as laxatives sold as drugs.", "nn Indeed, one quarter of prescription drugs and hundreds of over-the-counter products were originally isolated from plants.", "Ephedra, for example, contains a natural stimulant that is approved for use as a decongestant and bronchial dilator in some pharmaceutical products.", "However, when used in uncontrolled dosages or by people with certain underlying health problems, it can cause a dangerous rise in blood pressure and, in its herbal form, has been responsible for serious adverse reactions and dozens of deaths, mainly among people who inappropriately used it as a stimulant or diet aid.", "Complicating the safety issue is the fact, shown in several recent surveys, that most patients fail to tell their physicians they use herbal supplements and thus sometimes risk dangerous drug interactions or endure costly tests or treatments when an herb causes an unrecognized side effect.", "Experts say many patients withhold information about herbal drug use because they fear being ridiculed by their doctors.", "Although all German physicians must take courses on herbal remedies, only a handful of American medical and pharmacology schools offer courses in this field.", "A year ago, the President's Commission on Dietary Supplement Labels recommended that the FDA appoint a committee to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of herbal products.", "``This could be the most important step in the United States toward legitimizing herbal medicine,'' Tyler said.", "However, the agency responded that it lacked the budget to support such an effort.", "American physicians have completed and published only a few well-designed studies of some popular botanicals.", "Among them were studies showing that saw palmetto can shrink an enlarged prostate and ginkgo biloba can improve memory in patients with early Alzheimer's disease.", "The Office of Dietary Supplements at the National Institutes of Health is helping to finance a three-year multicenter study of St. John's wort as a treatment for clinical depression and a study of plant-based estrogens as a preventive for postmenopausal health problems.", "However, thousands of studies of botanicals have been completed abroad _ mainly in Germany _ that strongly suggest a health-promoting role for more than 200 plant products.", "Germany's Commission E evaluated 380 botanicals, approving 254 as safe and reasonably effective and disapproving 126 as ineffective, unsafe or both.", "The Germans use a different criterion to assess an herb's benefits _ a doctrine of ``reasonable certainty'' that the herb has the desired effect and is safe, Blumenthal said.", "Whereas standard testing of a drug for approval by the FDA can cost as much as $500 million per product _ a prohibitive amount for companies to spend on botanicals that cannot be patented _ tests to establish ``reasonable certainty'' would cost only $1 million to $2 million, Tyler estimated.", "In June 1996, Dr. Robert Temple, director of medical policy for the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation, suggested that, rather than subjecting botanicals to the extensive tests required for drugs, the agency might consider applying less stringent criteria to assess an herb's effects, at least when a product is to be used only for a short time.", "He said, ``A long history of safe use might provide sufficient safety information for products that are intended for short-term use.", "'' More than four dozen botanicals or botanical formulations have been submitted to the agency as investigational new drugs.", "If any meet the agency's criteria for safety and effectiveness and are eventually approved as drugs, they would be allowed to carry direct health claims _ instead of just structure and function statements _ on labels and in advertising.", "Meanwhile, Dr. Joerg Gruenwald, medical director of a German phytomedicine company and primary editor of the new Physicians' Desk Reference for Herbal Medicines, said professionals can rely on that volume for current, documented information about botanicals.", "The volume, to be issued annually, updates the Commission E reports and adds several hundred other products sold in the United States, listing effects, side effects and conditions in which their use is inadvisable.

Bowers suffered an attack.", "``I could feel my heart pounding through my shirt, my hands were jittery and I was hyperventilating, so my roommate took me to the emergency room,'' he recalled in a recent interview.", "``I took the Ripped Fuel with me, and before I even opened it up, the nurse guessed what it was,'' he said.", "``She said I wasn't the first whom she'd seen with the problem.",

regulation change.", "More than 150 people testified at the hearing, with an overwhelming majority against requiring prescription sales of ephedrine.", "Most who testified were connected to the industry that provides ephedrine-based dietary supplements or stimulants.", "The witnesses pleaded with the state to back down from the proposal and instead consider a compromise that, among other

of where is the profit going to go,'' Sindler told the committee.", "More than 60 companies in the Texas market ephedrine-based products, which constitute a multimillion industry in the state, according to Michael Ellis, president of Metabolife International.", "Although other states have restricted some sales of ephedrine products, Texas' proposal is by far the most far-reaching, Ellis said.", "``This shocked us,'' he said, stressing that there is no medical evidence that ephedrine products cause adverse effects.", "Ellis and Dr. Ted Farber, a toxicologist for the dietary supplement industry, disputed the number of complaints and deaths Culmo said were possibly linked to ephedrine products.", "The Food and Drug Administration originally had reported it was investigating more than 40 deaths possibly related to ephedrine, Farber said.", "But recently, the federal agency revised that number to only two, he said.", "An FDA spokeswoman did not respond to a request for the correct number.", "The FDA currently is considering prohibiting the marketing of dietary supplements containing 8 milligrams or more of ephedrine per dose.", "The agency also is looking at requiring product labels that instruct consumers not to use the product for more than seven days.", "As evidence ephedrine is safe, Ellis cited an ongoing study by Dr. Patricia Daly of the Harvard Medical School on the effects of a supplement containing caffeine and ephedra, an herb from which ephedrine is extracted.", "The incomplete study, paid for by companies that market ephedrine products, has found no adverse effects so far on patients, Daly said.", "The death about two months ago of a 15-year-old California girl who was taking an ephedrine-based stimulant also has highlighted the ongoing debate over the safety of such products.", "Rosanna Porras reportedly took Ripped Fuel capsules before collapsing at soccer practice.", "She later died, and California officials are still investigating the possibility that the herbal supplement caused her death.", "The company that markets Ripped Fuel, Twinlaboratories Inc. in New York, has said it does not believe its product was responsible.", "Bowers supports the move to ban such products from over-the-counter sales.", "``Sure, I'll admit that part of it's because of my own ignorance for trusting some 18-year-old who recommended the stuff at the

herbal and vitamin industry, a stainless steel contraption was hard at work on a recent morning, spitting out clear plastic capsules at the rate of 90,000 an hour.", "Each contained precisely 600 milligrams of a fine, brick-colored powder that federal health officials are trying to ban.", "The powder, a pulverized strain of rice called red yeast, is imported from China, where it has been consumed for 2,000 years, both as an herbal remedy (it was thought to improve blood flow) and a food (it spices up tofu and makes a tasty marinade for duck and pork.", ") Then, five years ago, William McGlashan Jr., a young California venture capitalist, learned that scientists in Beijing were studying the rice for another reason: it seemed to lower cholesterol.", "Today, McGlashan's company, Pharmanex, sells the encapsulated red powder under the trade name Cholestin in 37,000 American stores, from health food outlets to the giant Wal-Mart chain.", "McGlashan calls Cholestin a dietary supplement.", "Officials at the Food and Drug Administration call it something else: an illegal, unapproved drug.", "On June 15, in the gray stone federal courthouse in Salt Lake City, U.S. District Court Judge Dale Kimball will be asked to determine who is correct.", "The case is being watched as a pivotal battle between the FDA, which is chafing against a 1994 law that left it almost powerless to regulate vitamins and herbal products, and the dietary supplement industry, which has been growing wildly since the law was passed.", "At issue is not whether Cholestin is dangerous; no one argues that it is.", "Rather, the FDA contends that Cholestin has crossed the increasingly murky boundary that separates dietary supplements from drugs, because it contains an ingredient, lovastatin, that is the key component of a cholesterol-lowering drug.", "Pharmanex says the lovastatin occurs naturally and that Cholestin is more akin to a food than a drug.", "The outcome of the case could affect the medicine and kitchen cabinets of millions of American consumers, including many doctors and scientists, who have come to believe that herbs like ginkgo, echinacea and St. John's wort are as important to good health as aspirin and antibiotics.", "Aside from the turf battle between the supplement industry and regulators, the dispute raises crucial questions: What is the distinction between these herbal products, which may contain naturally occurring chemicals as potent as those in any drug, and drugs themselves?", "Must products like Cholestin be subjected to the rigorous testing that drugs undergo?", "``You see more and more dietary supplements sold right next to over-the-counter drugs,'' said William Schultz, the FDA's deputy commissioner for policy.", "``There is a risk that the line will blur.", "'' It is already blurry.", "``Foods are medicines; medicines are foods,'' said Loren Israelson, executive director of the Utah Natural Products Alliance, a trade group based in Salt Lake City.", "``If you drink coffee in the morning, why are you drinking coffee?", "You're looking for the caffeine, a stimulant.", "That same caffeine is sold over the counter as No-Doz.", "That's a drug when it's in a pill form, and it's a food when it's in coffee.", "Why is that?", "'' The FDA struggled with such questions for decades.", "But with the passage of the 1994 Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act, the law under which the Cholestin case will be decided, the agency's task grew even more vexing.", "The new law took dietary supplements out of the underground and into the mainstream, giving manufacturers like Pharmanex the long-sought right to advertise the potential benefits of herbs, even if the evidence for those benefits was sketchy.", "If the products were safe, companies could say what they wished, so long as they did not claim their products could prevent, treat or cure disease.", "Thus, McGlashan can advertise that Cholestin ``promotes healthy cholesterol,'' but not that it ``prevents heart attack or stroke.", "'' ``For the first time,'' he said, ``we can educate the American consumer about what the product does.", "We don't have to rely on a person in a health food store to explain it.", "'' Since the law was passed, the FDA has received about 2,300 notifications from manufacturers intending to make claims about their products, and has objected to about 150 of them.", "It has also proposed a rule that would restrict, but not eliminate, the manufacturer's ability to use the herbal stimulant ephedra, which has been linked to more than a dozen deaths nationwide.", "But these actions, says former Food and Drugs Commissioner David Kessler, are hardly enough to make a dent in the rampant proliferation of herbal remedies that he says are ineffective at best and unsafe at worst.", "``Just walk into your pharmacy; it's out of control,'' said Kessler, who waged a bitter, unsuccessful battle against the 1994 law as commissioner.", "``Efficacy is now defined as what sells off the shelves.", "The agency is powerless.", "'' While the law was a disaster for regulators, it was a windfall for businesses that sell herbs and vitamins.", "Indeed, after the act was adopted, annual sales of dietary supplements in the United States skyrocketed, jumping from more than $8 billion in 1994 to nearly $12 billion last year, according to the Nutrition Business Journal, a trade publication.", "So furious has the growth been that one analyst, Matthew Patsky of the Boston-based investment banking firm of Adams, Harkness &AMP; Hill, said some of the nation's biggest pharmaceutical companies are now planning to introduce their own lines of herbal products.", "That worries Schultz, the FDA deputy commissioner for policy.", "``If companies that would have tested their products and sold them as drugs are now going to not test them and sell them as dietary supplements,'' he said, ``then we have lost information about the safety and efficacy of those products.", "'' Among the law's beneficiaries was McGlashan, a 34-year-old Stanford University business school graduate who studied Chinese history as an undergraduate.", "With the baby boomers growing older, McGlashan sensed a growing demand for natural medicines the Chinese have used for centuries.", "nn McGlashan says he had a vision for his business; he wanted to apply ``pharmaceutical rigors'' to the dietary supplement industry, using research to persuade consumers that Eastern therapies worked.", "In early 1994, he Dr. Michael Chang, a medical chemist and former pharmaceutical industry researcher who had set up a manufacturing plant to produce herbal medicines in Huzhou, China, near Shanghai.", "Chang scoured Chinese research for promising herbal products and identified 5,000; together, he and McGlashan narrowed the list to 30.", "By early 1995, Pharmanex was born, with headquarters in Simi Valley, Calif. Red yeast rice, called Hong Qu, was one of the most promising projects on its list.", "``We know Hong Qu has been used for centuries, but we don't know why it lowers cholesterol,'' Chang said.", "``We need to find out.", "'' The 1994 law, McGlashan said, made it worth investing in science.", "The company introduced Cholestin at the end of 1996, after nearly three years of study.", "Most recently, Pharmanex enlisted Dr. David Heber, director of the Center for Human Nutrition at the University of California at Los Angeles, to study the effects of Cholestin in adults with moderately elevated cholesterol.", "The study, financed by Pharmanex, compared the cholesterol levels of 42 adults who took 2.5 grams of Cholestin every day for three months with the levels in 41 adults who were given placebos.", "Heber said the total cholesterol counts of those who took the supplement dropped, on average, from 250 to 210.", "Heber dismisses the contention that red yeast rice is a drug; instead he calls it ``a functional food.", "'' The same cholesterol-lowering ingredient in lovastatin, he notes, occurs in even higher concentrations in oyster mushrooms, commonly used in Asian cooking.", "And nobody, he said, is trying to ban mushrooms.", "However, Dr. Richard A. Friedman, director of psychopharmacology at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, contends the current distinction between dietary supplements and drugs is based on semantics, not biology, and that both should be carefully regulated.", "``If there is a biologically active component in the supplement, to say it is not a drug is illogical because it will have a similar effect,'' he said.", "Companies like Pharmanex, he added, ``want to be able to implant the idea in the public that the drug is medically beneficial'' without doing rigorous research drug companies must do to obtain approval.", "That kind of science, McGlashan admits, would cost far too much for a small company like his.", "Yet with a decent body of research behind Cholestin, he said, he at one time envisioned himself becoming the FDA's poster boy for good behavior.", "Instead, he received a visit from FDA investigators in April of last year; the agency had received complaints that Cholestin contained lovastatin, both from a pharmacist and from Merck &AMP; Co, the pharmaceutical company that manufactures Mevacor, the cholestorol-lowering drug that contains the same ingredient as Cholestin.", "Shortly thereafter, federal authorities impounded 10 tons of red yeast rice that had come into the Port of Los Angeles from China; the shipment is now sitting in a storage facility in Mexico.", "Then on May 20, the FDA notified McGlashan that it considered Cholestin illegal, a move that prompted the company to ask for a hearing before Kimball of the U.S. District Court in Salt Lake City.", "McGlashan contends that, at its root, the dispute is an economic one.", "Cholestin, he said, is sold to people who are too healthy for Mevacor, the Merck drug.", "Merck, he contends, is making a power grab for that market by trying to push Cholestin off the shelves _ a charge denied by Jan Weiner, a spokeswoman for the pharmaceutical company.", "While the court case is pending, McGlashan said, sales of Cholestin are booming.", "One woman recently wrote him to say she had purchased eight months' worth of the capsules.", "Even his mother called, he said, asking, ``How am I supposed to get my Cholestin?", "'' For now, McGlashan has no answer.", "Standing outside the low-pressure room where the encapsulating machine was spinning, a lab coat covering his royal blue shirt and Hermes tie, he looked a little wistful.", "The fine red powder being packed into the capsules, he said, was the last of his supply.", "&QL;

small group of people come down with fevers when they experience chills, according to an article published Saturday in The Lancet, the medical journal.", "One of the study's authors, Dr. Hal Hoffman of the University of California at San Diego, estimates that about 300 people, most in the United States, suffer from the disorder, familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome, or FCAS, which is caused by a single genetic mutation.", "In FCAS, what matters is not the actual temperature but the feeling of being chilled.", "\"It doesn't have to be very cold,\" Hoffman said.", "\"The biggest complaint of FCAS patients is air-conditioned rooms.", "\" To track the disease, Hoffman visited reunions of families carrying the affliction.", "It appears likely that most of the cases stem from a single immigrant in the 1600s, he said, although a few result from more recent mutations.", "Along with their symptoms, the patients also share a common family folklore.", "The story is that the disease started when an ancestor fell into cold water.", "The new study tested an arthritis drug, anakinra, which blocks the effect of a protein that is part of the chain of reactions identified in the cold syndrome.", "First, three women with the disorder were monitored after they sat in a 36-degree room for 45 minutes.", "All three developed fevers and rashes in the hours that followed.", "But none did when given an injection of anakinra before a second chilling.", "Though word of the drug's effectiveness has spread, only a few use it regularly, Hoffman said.", "Some can't afford it -- it's not covered by most insurance -- and others prefer to continue to bundle up.", "REFLUX TRIGGERS A new study from Norway adds smoking and eating salty food to the list of habits that can lead to chronic acid reflux.", "The study found that coffee, alcohol and tea appear to have no effect on the odds of developing the disorder, which is marked by heartburn and frequent regurgitation, while exercise and high-fiber bread appeared to offer some protection.", "Unfortunately for coffee or wine lovers who already suffer from reflux, the study's lead researcher said the findings did not mean a green light for their consumption.", "Coffee and alcohol, along with favorites like chocolate and spicy foods, can still bring on symptoms in reflux patients even if they play no role in its development, said the researcher, Dr. Magnus Nilsson of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm.", "The study, published on Thursday in Gut, a journal of the British Medical Association, was based on two surveys, carried out a decade apart, that included the bulk of the population of a rural county in central Norway.", "A group of 3,153 people who reported reflux were compared with 40,210 people who reported no significant symptoms.", "The researchers found that the odds of developing reflux were 70 percent higher for longtime smokers than for nonsmokers.", "People who ate a lot of salted fish and meat -- traditional foods in the area -- and those who always added salt at meals were significantly more likely to develop reflux than those who never did.", "A half-hour session of strenuous physical activity once a week or more, and regular consumption of high-fiber bread both appeared to cut the risk of reflux in half, the study said.", "Nilsson said that other research conducted by his team showed that people with reflux and people worried about developing it would both also benefit from losing excess weight.", "EPILEPSY AND INJURIES Many people with epilepsy restrict their activities, fearing injury during seizures, even if the disease is well controlled.", "But those fears appear to be overblown, a new Mayo Clinic study concludes.", "The study, published in the journal Neurology, examined the medical records of 247 epilepsy patients who were followed for an average of 10 years.", "It found that only 39 of them suffered seizure-related injuries and that most of them were minor, usually bruises to the head.", "The bulk of the injuries occurred among people with the most serious cases: those with uncontrolled seizures, with generalized convulsions or drop attacks, or those who had suffered injuries in falls in the past, according one of the study's authors, Dr. Elson L. So of the Mayo Clinic.", "Frequency of seizures was the strongest predictor of injury, he said.", "So said that being too cautious carried its own risks, possibly resulting in \"social isolation, physical inactivity and psychological dependency.", "\" He advises people with epilepsy outside the high-risk category to take basic safety measures like wearing helmets while biking.", "They may also consider having companions or supervision for more dangerous activities like swimming.", "Those at higher risk should work with their doctors to bring their seizures under the tightest possible control, he said.", "They should avoid driving and stress and should modify their homes to reduce the chance of accidents or injury, he said.", "An editorial accompanying the article noted that a loosening of restrictions for drivers with epilepsy had not been accompanied by noticeably higher accident rates.", "THE LANGUAGE OF POSTURE The brain reacts more powerfully to the body language of a person in a posture denoting fear than it does to a fearful facial expression, according to a study released Monday.", "The study found that fearful postures activated areas of the brain that happy or neutral postures did not, said the study's lead researcher, Dr. Beatrice de Gelder of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.", "And the reactions to body language involved several areas of the brain not activated by reading faces, including some that process emotions and others that prepare for action.", "\"You could almost say that when you see a fearful body you react with your whole body,\" de Gelder said.", "She said the study, published online in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, offered support to Darwin's theory that emotions are useful in an evolutionary sense because they predispose us to actions that increase the chance of survival.", "For the study, actors were asked to depict scary situations like opening a door and finding a robber, along with happy or emotionally neutral ones like pouring water.", "Still pictures of these, with the actors' faces blurred out, were presented to seven test subjects while their brains were scanned with equipment to detect what regions of the brain were being activated.", "De Gelder said the brain might react more powerfully to emotions signaled through body language than to faces because faces also convey other information, like personal identity, that could slow down mental processing in a moment of danger.

stillbirths, listeria can cause fatal blood infections and meningitis.", "Without a new method of detection, Tauxe said, ``I don't think we would have identified where the listeria came from.", "''

process.", "Doctors now say the prospective mother was struck by listeriosis, a disease caused by the bacteria Listeria monocytogenes, a food-borne pathogen often found in hot dogs, luncheon meats, soft cheese, even milk.", "Lee's once-rare disease has received tremendous attention in recent months, especially since a massive recall in December of possibly tainted food from a Michigan plant.", "Bil Mar Foods Co., a meat processor owned by Sara Lee in Zeeland, Mich., recalled 15 million pounds of hot dogs and cold cuts after a rare strain of the listeria bacteria was found in both opened and unopened packages.", "The same strain, pattern E, has been linked to 12 adult deaths and five miscarriages among 82 illnesses in 19 states.", "Aside from causing stillbirths and miscarriages, listeriosis also can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in people with weakened immune systems: infants, the elderly or patients with chronic diseases, HIV infection or undergoing cancer chemotherapy.", "Although Bil Mar is the only plant to have an outbreak with illnesses traced to its products, several others across the country have had to recall products after tests detected listeria.", "Since September, there have been nine known recalls due to listeria, mostly from deli meats and hot dogs.", "One recall was for milk.", "It's an increase from the corresponding period a year earlier when the Agriculture Department recorded just one listeria-related recall.", "And that recall was at the end of 1997, the only recall of that year.", "``It certainly seems like it's on the rise,'' said Dr. Robert B. Gravani, professor of food science at Cornell University.", "He said experts are trying to determine whether the incidents are due to better reporting or whether the listeria really is appearing more frequently.", "Better testing and reporting is the more likely reason, said Margaret Glavin, associate administrator for USDA's food safety and inspection service.", "``We don't see an uptrend in the number of positives we're finding,'' she said.", "Listeria was a real problem for the United States in the mid-1980s, said Dr. Lester Crawford, director of Georgetown University's Center for Food and Nutrition Policy, but the government declared zero tolerance for the pathogen.", "Listeria levels dropped sharply, Crawford said.", "``By 1994, the CDC (Centers for Disease Control) was proclaiming that this was one of the most successful regulatory actions in U.S. history,'' Crawford said.", "Now the sudden rise in recalls has experts baffled.", "``We have explored whether or not there might be a new strain or new characteristics in listeria that's causing it to be more difficult to control,'' Crawford said.", "So far, no evidence has been found to support that theory.", "Experts also found no evidence that a new scientific-based food inspection program, USDA's Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point, has failed.", "If anything, they argue, HACCP's inspections, which monitor things like temperature in the processing system, have helped.", "So, why is listeria suddenly popping up?", "``We're sort of left with no real answer,'' Crawford said.", "For now, he and other experts, remind people to cook hot dogs and eat deli meats before the sell-by date.", "They also say consumers should be careful not to reheat leftovers more than once.", "Pregnant women, about 20 times more likely than other healthy adults to get listeriosis, should be particularly careful to never eat raw meat or undercooked eggs or food, the USDA recommends.", "They also should avoid soft cheeses, such as feta or Brie, and avoid food from deli counters.", "Any lunch meat or hot dogs should be thoroughly heated.", "For Lisa Lee, it was a risk she says she never knew existed.", "Luncheon meat in her

"According to an advance text of his Saturday radio address, the president will also ask Congress to give the Food and Drug Administration ``greater authority to halt imports of fruits, vegetables and other food products that are produced under safety conditions that do not match our own strict standards,'' and to give the Department of Agriculture ``new authority to impose tough fines on businesses who violate those standards and to issue mandatory recall of unsafe meat and poultry.", "'' The government has no reliable tracking system, but health officials say food-borne diseases

woman ill and resulted in the recall of 172,000 pounds of ground-beef patties contaminated with the deadly bacteria E. coli O157:H7.", "But Congress has failed to address legislation proposed by the administration to give the food agencies greater authority, and it appears unlikely that Congress will provide the full amount of money the administration has requested to expand inspections, increase research and surveillance of food-borne illness and educate consumers.", "Before the July 4 recess, the House voted to provide only $16.8 million of the requested money, and the Senate bill, which has

made 200 people ill in 11 states.", "``Salmonella in breakfast cereal is basically a first for us in this country,'' Tauxe said.", "``We cannot have a breakfast-cereal plant having failures like that,

Yushchenko's chest and essentially nearly anesthetize him with huge doses of opiates.", "Because opiates depress respiratory functions, his breathing rate slowed, and his vital signs had to be constantly monitored.", "More medicine would have required that Yushchenko be placed on a respirator, Zimpfer said.", "Yushchenko and his doctors made a difficult choice: They decided to place an epidural catheter between his shoulder blades into the membranes of the upper spine so that medicines could be delivered to the nerves in his back without compromising his mental abilities.",

Yushchenko, 50, was mysteriously transformed into a blotch of lesions after he reached Austria.", "He also suffered severe abdominal and back pain and paralysis on the left side of his face.", "His appearance has continued to worsen, raising public concern about his health despite his claims he is fully recovering.", "Yushchenko contends he was poisoned in an assassination attempt by ``government officials'' who feared that he would defeat Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych in runoff elections held on Nov. 21.", "His opponents have dismissed the charge, saying he got sick after gorging himself on bad sushi and too much alcohol.", "Yanukovych was officially declared the winner of the Nov. 21 vote.", "The country's Supreme Court soon overturned that finding, citing widespread poll fraud, and a new election will be held on Dec. 26.", "The Austrian doctors, addressing reporters in Vienna on Saturday, said Yushchenko's long-term prognosis was good, though it could take several years for his face to heal.", "For now, Yushchenko is ``fully capable of working,'' said Nikolai Korpan, another doctor.", "``If this dose had been higher, it may have caused death,'' Zimpfer said, noting the dioxin could have been administered through food, such as soup.", "Dioxins are a group of organic compounds that contain chlorine.", "They are a common byproduct in the manufacture of many industrial chemicals, and are also a common contaminant from waste incineration.", "They are a component of the Vietnam-era defoliant Agent Orange and many researchers have labeled them a cause of cancer and other diseases among people who were exposed to the defoliant.", "Debate over dioxins' potency as a poison, as opposed to a cancer-causing agent, has swirled for decades.", "But the compounds are known to cause reproductive and developmental problems, in addition to extreme skin eruptions known as chloracne.", "Documented cases of acute dioxin poisoning are rare.", "One notable case occurred in Seveso, Italy, in 1976, when an explosion at a Hoffman-LaRoche chemical plant released a cloud of the herbicide 2,4,5-T, exposing several thousand people to the chemical and an estimated 45 pounds of dioxins, which typically arise as a byproduct in the synthesis of 2,4,5-T.", "Many people near the plant developed severe skin problems within hours.", "In the months that followed, many who experienced heavy exposures developed chloracne.", "Another case occurred in 1997 in Vienna, where two employees of a textile institute developed chloracne on their bodies, according to Olaf Paepke, a scientist at a Hamburg institute, who conducted chemical analysis for the investigation.", "The employees had levels of dioxin in their systems thousands of times higher than normally found.", "Police were never able to determine how the poisoning occurred, including if it was deliberate or accidental, Paepke said.", "The employees survived.", "Dioxins are not commercially available, Paepke said, but can be obtained through industry contacts or made in a laboratory by people with the proper skills.", "A tiny, unnoticeable amount placed in food is sufficient to cause severe illness, he said.", "Arnold Schecter, a dioxin expert at the University of Texas School of Public Health at Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, said dioxins can be highly effective poison in people who are sensitive to their effects.", "If Yushchenko was deliberately given dioxin, it was done by ``someone was very clever and very knowledgeable,'' Schecter said.", "``If someone put a drop of pure dioxin in his food, he wouldn't taste it, he wouldn't see it and a few days later he'd start to get sick,'' Schecter said.", "``If you are trying to kill someone quickly, it's not the way to go,'' he said.", "``But if you want to disable someone and want to do it subtly and have it happen days or weeks or months after you have contact with someone, this can do it,'' Schecter said.", "``Plus there are very few labs in the world that can accurately detect dioxin in the blood.", "'' Paul M.

(with sidebar 2BINGEEATING) Binge eating gets a closer look New study tests drug that curbs overeaters' urge The temptation to overeat will strike most of us during the holiday season, but for those who suffer from a binge-eating disorder, holiday feasting can be self-inflicted hell.", "Binge eating disorder is a newly recognized condition that probably affects millions of Americans.", "Those with the disorder frequently eat large amounts of food while feeling at a loss to control their eating.", "To date, there are no approved medications to treat binge-eating disorder, but a large, multi-center study may offer hope to the 2 percent of the population who suffer from it.", "Dr. Nathan Shapira, an assistant professor of psychiatry of the University of Florida's College of Medicine, is among the researchers testing the effectiveness of topiramate, a drug developed to treat the convulsions and seizures of epilepsy, in controlling binge eating.", "Shapira said that when topiramate was used for epilepsy patients, many reported that they also had a marked decrease in appetite and even lost weight.", "A small study of some 60 patients with binge eating disorder showed that those who received the topiramate rather than a placebo binged less often and also lost weight.", "The new study will test the effectiveness of topiramate in 350 binge eaters from around the country, Shapira said.", "Results are anticipated next year.", "It is funded by Ortho McNeil Pharmaceutical, which makes the drug.", "Binge eating disorder, Shapira emphasizes, is not the same as indulging in an occasional binge at the table or \"grazing\" through an array of buffet offerings.", "\"Everyone probably binges at some point, particularly during 'sanctioned' events like Thanksgiving dinner,\" Shapira said.", "\"The real difference between 'grazing' and binge eating is eating much more than normal in a short period of time, often less than two hours.", "\"It's a terrible situation to be surrounded by food when that's all that you are thinking about,\" he said.", "After a binge, he said, binge eaters feel disgusted with themselves.", "As a result, they often eat alone or very rapidly, and will eat until they are uncomfortably full.", "Unlike eating disorders such as bulimia nervosa or anorexia where victims are predominantly female, the ratio of female to male binge eaters is about 3-to-2.", "It is common in all ethnic groups.", "Almost all who have this disorder are either overweight or obese.", "It has been estimated that up to 30 percent of those in weight-loss programs have a binge-eating disorder.", "They usually develop a weight problem earlier in life and do not do as well in these programs.", "One study looking at Overeaters Anonymous found that 70 percent of the members had a binge eating disorder, Shapira said.", "The major complications of binge eating disorder are the diseases that accompany obesity.", "These include diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, gallbladder disease, heart disease and certain types of cancer.", "The causes of the disorder are still unknown, but up to half of all people with binge eating disorder have a history of depression.", "Whether depression is a cause or effect is unclear, according to the National Institutes of Health.", "Many people report that anger, sadness, boredom, anxiety or other negative emotions can trigger a binge episode.", "\"There's a lack of recognition that this disorder is very common and treatable,\" Shapira said.", "For those who think they might have an eating problem, he suggests two questions: Do you eat a lot of food in a short period?", "Do you feel out of control as you do so?", "Those who answer \"yes\" to both should consider whether they have a binge-eating disorder.", "(Diane Chun writes for The Gainesville (Fla.) Sun.", ") "]}, {"headline": "DAUGHTER'S STRUGGLE WITH BULIMIA SPURS WOMAN TO ACTION", "id": "NYT_ENG_20041108.0161", "wordCounts": {"all": 3, "coach": 1, "forget": 1, "caused": 3, "daughter's": 2,

flabby.", "Her periods are irregular, but she has never gone more than three months without menstruating.", "Another woman, who is also 20 and also 5-foot-8, has an opposite eating pattern.", "She goes without eating all day, and starting at 6 p.m. she eats nonstop, whatever she can get her hands on.", "Her favorite pastime is to sit in front of the television with a gallon of mocha-chip ice cream.", "She maintains a normal weight of 130 by occasionally forcing herself to vomit.", "But purging is not always easy in her college dormitory, with four young women sharing a single bathroom, so she ends up vomiting, on average, about once a week.", "Everyone can agree that these women have some sort of disordered eating.", "But psychiatrists would say that neither one falls into the strict definition of anorexia nervosa, the most severe eating disorder, or its relative, bulimia nervosa.", "According to the bible of psychiatric diagnosis, the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual,anorexia must be accompanied by cessation of menstrual periods for at least three months in a row, and bulimia must involve vomiting or other forms of purging at least twice a week, on average.", "Instead these women, and thousands like them, would fall into a category that doctors have been relying on for years, a vague nondiagnosis known by the acronym EDNOS: eating disorder not otherwise specified.", "Diagnosing psychiatric conditions is more of an art than a science, and the Not Otherwise Specified label reflects the imprecision of that art.", "The American Psychiatric Association's manual has a Not Otherwise Specified category for many disorders, whenever symptoms are so vague, so mild or so untreatable that it doesn't seem to warrant the full-fledged diagnosis.", "With the manual continually under revision, the Not Otherwise Specified grab bag is the place where new diagnoses emerge.", "For instance, the diagnosis of Asperger's syndrome, a variant of autism, was pulled from a collection of disorders previously labeled Pervasive Personality Disorder Not Otherwise Specified.", "Much is at stake in whether a condition is elevated to the status of a full-fledged diagnosis.", "Because no laboratory tests or other objective criteria exist for making psychiatric diagnoses, the American Psychiatric Association's manual is the definitive arbiter of the line between normal and abnormal.", "Its definitions help determine such practical matters as insurance reimbursement, competence and eligibility for disability.", "But they also help determine something more elusive, and probably more important: whether someone's behavior should be considered a personality quirk or a symptom of mental illness.", "Now, in the diagnostic category of eating disorders, the search for greater specificity in the Not Otherwise Specified grab bag is generating much attention.", "\"The Future of EDNOS\" was a topic at an international meeting on eating disorders in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, last month, and it is the title of a book expected to be released in Europe next year.", "To some observers, this new attention comes not a moment too soon.", "\"EDNOS right now is a real hodgepodge,\" said Dr. B. Timothy Walsh, professor of pediatric psychopharmacology at Columbia.", "\"We have people in that category with anorexia nervosa,\" but they still menstruate so they don't meet all the criteria for a formal diagnosis.", "Similarly, Walsh said, \"we have people who are obese and binge but don't vomit,\" so they don't fit into the strict definition of bulimia nervosa, which requires both binging and purging.", "Or they might binge and vomit once a week, but to qualify as bulimic they would have to vomit at least twice a week.", "\"What we really need to do is collect data,\" Walsh said.", "\"All the knowledge base we currently have relates to people who vomit twice a week.", "But if it turns out that the characteristics of those who binge and vomit once a week are similar to those who do so twice a week, then we can loosen the criteria for bulimia nervosa.", "\" The history of eating disorders has been a gradual one as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual has been revised through the years.", "Anorexia nervosa first appeared in the version of the manual published in 1980, and bulimia appeared for the first time in the same edition.", "Bulimia was renamed bulimia nervosa in the next edition, which came out in 1987.", "Anorexia nervosa affects 0.5 to 3.7 percent -- or about 1.5 million to 11 million American women -- at some point in life, according to the National Institute of Mental Health.", "Rates are lower among men and teenage boys.", "The lifetime prevalence of bulimia is higher -- from 1.1 to 4.2 percent of women -- with a similar age and sex distribution.", "In the current version of the diagnostic manual, published in 1994, one condition -- binge eating disorder -- was pulled out of EDNOS and listed as a \"provisional diagnostic category,\" the first step in the process of achieving its own diagnosis.", "The disorder is much like bulimia nervosa, but without the purging.", "The \"provisional\" designation highlights the need for more research into a condition's prevalence and treatment, and highlighting binge eating disorder in this way was a prelude to its being named as a separate diagnosis in the manual that is to appear in 2012.", "\"That's one of most compelling reasons to get something out of the Not Otherwise Specified category,\" said Dr. Michael First, associate professor of clinical psychiatry at Columbia.", "First is a member of the planning group that is directing the enormous undertaking of revising the manual for its fifth edition.", "\"If you feel that there's a homogeneous group of patients in there for which there's a treatment, the fact that it's called Not Otherwise Specified really obscures it, hindering treatment, hindering research,\" he said.", "Another candidate for a new eating disorder in the fifth edition of the manual can be thought of as the flip side of binge eating, a condition that has been labeled \"purging disorder\" by Dr. Pamela Keel, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Iowa.", "Just as binge eating disorder has many of the characteristics of bulimia, so does purging disorder.", "But neither meets the strict criteria for bulimia nervosa.", "People with purging disorder, Keel said, are of normal weight, and they purge after eating normal or even small amounts of food.", "Right now, purging disorder is relatively hidden, buried in the EDNOS category.", "And until the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual panelists ask for more data, as they have for binge eating disorder, not much more will be known, Keel said.", "\"Within widely used diagnostic interviews, if a person has never had a low weight and denies a history of binge eating, the interviewer skips all questions regarding the use of vomiting, laxatives or diuretics to control weight,\" Keel wrote in an e-mail message.", "\"It's very difficult to learn more about a problem if you never ask any questions about it.", "\" (STORY CAN END HERE.", "OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.", ") As First sees it, several criteria must be met before a diagnosis is pulled out of the Not Otherwise Specified category and into a stand-alone diagnosis.", "These criteria have to be met before binge eating disorder, purging disorder or any other condition emerges out of the EDNOS grab bag.", "The first requirement is that a significant number of patients must be affected, he said.", "Second, there has to be evidence of an existing and effective treatment.", "The criterion of an effective treatment has prevented many conditions from being entered in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual.", "In the 1980s, there was an effort to include \"sadistic personality disorder.", "\" But it failed, said First, because no treatment existed.", "\"We could have decided to call something sadistic personality disorder,\" he said, \"but if there's no treatment, what would be the point?", "\" The third criterion for removing a condition from the Not Otherwise Specified category is the trickiest to meet.", "It relates to a kind of diagnosis-creep.", "Experts working on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual panels must ask how close the condition is to behavior that could be considered normal.", "For binge eating disorder, for instance, they must ask: When is such behavior a true psychiatric condition, and when is it the kind of thing that almost everyone engages in every Thanksgiving?", "\"This is the matter of what we call false positives,\" First said.", "\"It's the danger of defining as a psychiatric syndrome a set of symptoms that normal people have.", "\" When a new category is created in the manual, he said, \"you're trying to identify a category that will help patients get treatment.", "\" \"But,\" he continued, \"you're worried that this category is going to be applied to normal people as well.", "\" Some psychiatrists want to create a different label for EDNOS, calling it instead \"mixed eating disorder\" or \"atypical eating disorder.", "\" But Walsh of Columbia said that would be merely a cosmetic change.", "\"If I'm a clinician and I get a call from a school saying, 'Hey, I've got a person with mixed eating disorder coming over,' I don't know if I'm going to be seeing someone who weighs 80 pounds or 280 pounds,\" he said.", "\"The whole belief that diagnoses are useful things rests on their ability to put together under one umbrella a relatively homogeneous set of syndromes, which gives the clinician the ability to shortcut a full assessment.", "\" Diagnostic labels, said Walsh, \"allow big shortcuts.", "\" Keel, on the other hand, prefers the term \"mixed eating disorder\" over EDNOS.", "She said the mixed eating disorder label \"may have the benefit of eliminating the false impression that EDNOS is somehow less severe or less clinically significant than so-called full-threshold eating disorders.", "\" But she expressed concern that the term would limit the enthusiasm for teasing out what other identifiable conditions lie within the EDNOS category.", "As experts debate what to do about EDNOS -- pull out distinct disorders from the grab bag category, change the diagnostic criteria for the existing disorder, give the grab bag a more scientific-sounding name -- people with disordered eating are left in a kind of therapeutic limbo.", "Eventually, the hope is, the uncertainties will be resolved, and the woman with anorexia who still menstruates and the woman with bulimia who only purges once a week, will be able to get the diagnosis and treatment that they need.

the storm FEMA Director James Lee Witt has been dreading since taking office six years ago: a catastrophic hurricane that hugs the coastline from Florida to the Carolinas, causing massive damage along a swath hundreds of miles long.", "``We've tried to prepare for the worst possible case, and this is one of those cases,'' said Witt, head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency after concluding a video conference with emergency teams spread out across the country.", "The prospect of an extremely powerful, coast-hugging hurricane ``was a scenario that ever since I've been here I've hoped I'd never see,'' Witt said Monday, noting that the destruction could cover ``not just one area, it's the whole coastline and the pounding it's going to take.", "'' Jim Loomis, reporting to Witt from the Florida Division of Emergency Management in a late afternoon video conference, said ``if this parallels us, it could act like a Weed-Eater for 25 miles along the coast.", "Most of those counties don't have population inland, they sit right on the coast, so it's going to be pretty devastating as far as who is going to get hit.", "'' FEMA officials say that regardless of where Hurricane Floyd strikes, the federal response will be far different from the tardy answer to Hurricane Andrew seven years ago.", "``There are a lot of things going on that were not going on six years ago,'' said Lacy Suiter, Federal Emergency Management Agency's executive associate director.", "When Andrew slammed into Florida just south of Miami in August 1992, the tardy and disjointed federal response sparked cries of anger from state and local authorities and prompted then-President Bush to name his transportation secretary to coordinate the federal effect.", "FEMA officials Monday said the agency has changed dramatically since then.", "They said they were ready to roll and could have supplies into an affected area within hours after the Floyd's passage.", "``The federal government is being not just reactive to events and the requests of the governors, but we're being pro-active,'' Suiter said.", "``We're not waiting until the hurricane comes ashore to buy the ice and buy the water and get the generators ready and get the other things ready to move out to the area.", "We're doing it now in anticipation of what the requirements might be,'' Suiter said.", "``We've been through this enough to know what to anticipate and what to plan for.", "'' FEMA emergency response centers have been activated in Atlanta and Washington, and it has representatives at state emergency centers from Florida to North Carolina.", "A hurricane liaison team of federal emergency officials is also stationed at the National Hurricane Center in Miami to monitor the latest forecasts of the storm's path and intensity.", "Meanwhile, FEMA has positioned ice, water, plastic sheeting, cots, tents, and emergency food and medial supplies in Atlanta where they can be delivered within hours wherever Floyd hits land, said Bruce Baughman, FEMA director of response.", "There are more than 30,000 rolls of plastic sheeting _ enough to cover 25,000 roofless houses _ and some 100 tons of ice, he said.", "The supplies are being kept in Atlanta, rather than closer to where the hurricane might hit, in order to protect them.", "``Depending on the track (taken by the storm) you don't want to get it too far forward because the supplies themselves may become a victim,'' Baughman said.", "In addition to the supplies on hand, FEMA has contracted with suppliers to provide additional support such as debris removal, roofing repairs and bulk water if needed, he said.", "Meanwhile, the federal government is urging individuals to prepare by making their property as hurricane-proof as possible _ such as removing lawn furniture _ and listening to local government warnings.", "Residents also are urged to check the FEMA Internet site for other tips at www.fema.gov.", "``This is a serious storm,'' Suiter said.", "``It may be the worst storm that we have had in many, many years.", "'' ENDIT Story Filed By Cox Newspapers For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service "]}, {"headline": "&HT;",

from its westerly course by a trough of low pressure air moving to the east and southeast, and, instead of making landfall in South Florida, travel up the coast, its dangerous eye offshore.", "But that hope seemed to weaken by early Monday evening as Floyd plowed west and slightly northwest, in the general direction of Palm Beach.", "``This is the sort of the thing you have nightmares about,''

landfall, sending the most destructive part of the hurricane along the coast, meteorologists said.", "Like Andrew in 1992, which killed 40 people, wrecked 160 homes and caused more than $25 billion in damages, Floyd was a category 4 storm on Monday.", "It was on the verge of being a category 5, the most powerful, as of Monday evening, with the power to turn houses into rubble and splinters if it makes landfall.", "But Jarrell warned that even if the hurricane's eye stays as much as 30 miles off the coast the storm could still rip roofs off houses and flatten walls.", "Meteorologists called it

strongest storms'' in history to hit the U.S. coast.", "``It runs 700 miles in all directions,'' he said of the storm's size, noting that the hurricane-force winds extend 120 miles from its eye.", "``We are going to feel it,'' he said.", "Forecasters, while warning that this hurricane was large and powerful enough to overcome steering winds like the much-hoped-for southeasterly front, still held some hope that the trough would nudge it northeasterly.", "As night fell on South Florida, shelters and hotel rooms inland, especially around Palm Beach, began to fill; cruise ships left for safer waters to the south; long flotillas of pleasure craft snaked along canals looking for safe harbor, as lines grew at hardware and grocery stores.", "Because it was still too soon to more

the shining jewels of the Chesapeake Bay for generations.", "From the dock, Jason Ruth, a worker at Harris', began culling the pile with an expert's eye, selecting those to keep and shuck and those to return to the bay.", "Taking handfuls at a time, Ruth flung the oysters back into the water.", "\"See,\" he said, picking up one in a fluid motion and knocking it with a quick tap against the pile, making a hollow thunk.", "\"There's nothing there.", "It's dead.", "Gone.", "\" The shell landed back in the water with a splash.", "Similar scenes are unfolding these days up and down the Chesapeake Bay, where the annual oyster season is becoming an endangered tradition.", "For centuries, the Chesapeake has been synonymous with oysters.", "For early settlers, oyster reefs were so abundant that they posed a hazard for navigation, and with the introduction of canning in the 1800s, the Chesapeake became the source for oysters around the world.", "But the annual good cheer surrounding the season is waning.", "That is because Chesapeake watermen pulled an all-time low of about 25,000 bushels of oysters from the bay last year, compared with 80,000 in 1993 -- and a staggering 15 million back in the glory days of 1885.", "From 1920 to 1970, before the oyster began its rapid decline, the industry contributed $65 million annually to the state of Maryland, a figure that didn't include the tourism it attracted.", "The annual figure has fallen to $500,000.", "Overharvesting and pollution have taken a toll on the native oyster, but far bigger threats to the species are two parasites that attack them, Dermo and MSX, which were first detected in the bay in the 1960s.", "Harris' is a holdout in a devastated industry; one of the last oyster-packing companies on the Chesapeake, where once there were hundreds.", "Just a few miles across the Chesapeake Bay Bridge from Annapolis, the waters of Kent Narrows, which leads to the bay, were home to 13 oyster packing houses at about the time Harris' opened in 1947.", "Now, it stands alone in the shadow of the Kent Narrows Bridge.", "But some oysters do survive in the bay.", "Harris' shucks, packs and sells them at its packing company and serves them in its dockside restaurant overlooking the narrows.", "At the height of oyster season, which began Oct. 1 and runs through the end of March, Harris' rolls out an all-you-can-eat buffet, featuring oysters served seven different ways.", "Indeed, fall oyster celebrations still abound in bayside communities on the Chesapeake, where old traditions die hard and the oysters remain as much a symbol of the season's arrival as cider, apples and pumpkins.", "Here, the mighty oyster is toasted in the wood-paneled oyster bars of Annapolis -- McGarvey's, O'Brien's and the Middleton

immigrants who usually pick crabs and shuck oysters.", "These migrant workers have come to dominate shellfish processing over the past decade -- doing dirty, repetitive work that machines can't and Americans won't, employers say.", "But this year, the seasonal-work visa program that provides these laborers hit its limit of 66,000 workers on the earliest date ever, Jan. 3.", "That has left many businesses empty-handed, including ski resorts in New England, fish plants in Washington state, and dozens of processors in Maryland and Virginia.", "``People suddenly woke up to the fact that they're going to be out of business this spring,'' said Bill Sieling, executive director of the Chesapeake Bay Seafood Industries Association, which represents seafood plants around the bay.", "In all, Sieling said, about 20 plants -- all on the Eastern Shore -- were unable to get the workers they applied for.", "Added together, their requests totaled about 800 workers, he said.", "Now, members of Congress up and down the East Coast are lobbying for the cap on guest workers to be raised.", "And seafood processors are scrambling to find other workers or face shutting down for the season -- and possibly for good.", "``When the crabs start running in the summer ... and you don't have this infrastructure to pick them anymore, it's going to be bad,'' said Jack Brooks, president of the J.M.", "Clayton seafood company in Cambridge, Md.", "His firm usually has about 30 immigrant workers.", "But some immigration experts say lifting the cap on laborers isn't the solution.", "Mark Krikorian, of the Center for Immigration Studies, said that shellfish processors either should pay wages high enough to attract American workers or invent a way to mechanize the work.", "``The presence of these foreign workers creates a dependency'' among employers, Krikorian said.", "``It's hard to wean away from it.", "'' The visa program at issue, known as H-2B, allows workers to enter the country for seasonal work outside of agriculture and then return home.", "Before bringing in a worker under this program, an employer must prove that no U.S. residents are willing to do the job.", "The program has become more popular across the country in recent years and has been used to fill jobs from lawn care workers to lifeguards.", "It has become particularly valuable around the bay, where the process of removing crab and oyster meat from shells is still done largely by hand.", "The work is unpleasant.", "Picking crabs, for instance, requires scraping off the cooked crab's gills, cleaning out its organs, breaking off the mouth and prying meat out of tiny cavities.", "All that must be repeated up to 600 times a day, yielding a daily wage that might reach $120 on a good day, Brooks said.", "That amounts to 20 cents a crab.", "Adding to the undesirability in these jobs, experts say, is the fact that in recent years they have changed from year-round to seasonal because there no longer are enough shellfish in the polluted bay to sustain them.", "As a result, experts say, a once-large labor pool has vanished as local workers found better jobs.", "``There's no one else,'' said Karen Oertel, of W.H.", "Harris Seafood House in Chester, Md.", "``Nobody shucks an oyster anymore.", "'' The shellfish processors turned to the H-2B program, bringing in hundreds of Mexicans and other immigrants to spend several months in the plants.", "About 90 percent of Maryland's crab meat is produced by plants using H-2B workers, said Douglas Lipton, a professor of resource management at the University of Maryland.", "But Chesapeake processors say a quirk of the program puts them at a disadvantage.", "The window for applications opens in October, but employers can apply no more than four months before they need workers.", "Seafood plants do not need help until April.", "When they applied this year, many of the plants were shut out, officials say.", "One of them was the Graham and Rollins plant in Hampton, Va., which asked for 100 guest workers and received none.", "Without immigrant workers, John Graham said, he has only about 18 local laborers.", "``I need at least 80 to open the doors,'' Graham said.", "``We are totally dependent on this system,'' he said of the H-2B program.

after that last interview?", "So did Bronti Kelly, a retail salesman and former military reservist from Temecula, Calif., who couldn't figure out why he was repeatedly turned down in the early 1990s for dozens of sales positions at department stores _ or dismissed within a week if he did manage to secure a job.", "In 1995, after more than four years, Kelly, now 34, finally discovered the problem: He had been denied employment because of an erroneous shoplifting report circulated to retailers who did background checks on him when he applied for work.", "The report had been forwarded by one of the stores to which he had applied _ Robinsons-May _ through its parent company, the May Department Stores, to the Stores Protective Association, a nonprofit group in Simi Valley, Calif., that provides background screening, work histories and loss-prevention programs to about 100 retail chains, manufacturers and other businesses.", "Members of the association, founded in 1929, share information about employees.", "The group is a regional affiliate of the United States Mutual Association, an 80-year-old private clearinghouse in Chicago that pools theft case reports from its 10 member groups nationwide _ it currently has about two million such reports _ and operates much like a major credit bureau.", "Kelly says he was the victim of identity theft.", "After his wallet was stolen, he said, a shoplifter who was arrested used Kelly's name and identification; the Los Angeles County Police Department corroborated his account.", "When he was unable to get work, he ended up filing for bankruptcy and became homeless for a time.", "After he found out about the shoplifting report, Kelly sued May and the Stores Protective Association in 1995, complaining that May had failed to correct the report in the association's files even after he had discovered it and provided proof of his innocence.", "The association was found not liable, and May settled out of court in January, paying Kelly $73,680.", "``It cost me my life, really,'' said Kelly, who has since legally changed his name and Social Security number.", "``I never knew why I wasn't being hired.", "That's the insidious nature of this _ there's often no way to know for sure.", "'' Rhonda West, a spokeswoman for the May Department Stores in St. Louis, said, ``We regret the difficulties this created for Kelly.", "'' Kelly's story points to a growing conflict between the rights of employers and employees in an age of quick, easy and inexpensive computer access to public information: how to balance a company's need to know about a person it might hire with the individual's need for privacy.", "Despite the best efforts of federal regulators and private businesses, workers can be plagued by black marks mistakenly left on public records if they do not pursue their right to discover and correct errors.", "``Ten years ago, you had to hire a gumshoe to find out about a person's background,'' said Beth Givens, director of the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, a nonprofit advocacy organization in San Diego.", "``Now you don't have to go any farther than your desk _ what you can find out today for typically under $100 is incredible.", "'' More public records have been placed on the Internet in recent years as information brokers have linked with public agencies, governments and businesses for computer access that enables them to compile virtual dossiers on anyone, including data like Social Security numbers, property ownership, driving records and nearest relatives.", "The services available range from large, blue-chip investigation companies to upstart Web sites that offer data at bargain rates.", "Checks can be done in days or minutes, usually for a cost of $5 to $200.", "Since many employers do not disclose what sort of background checks they use, it is hard to know exactly how they conduct them.", "But one thing is sure: The scrutiny of job applicants has intensified in recent years, as incidents of workplace violence, and the number of lawsuits charging employers with negligence in hiring, have increased, employment experts say.", "And that has meant a boom for the companies _ especially Web-based services _ that do such searches.", "Technology, of course, has spawned an increase in the number of databases containing background information and has made such information available faster.", "Some of the services available are www.knowx.com, which uses the Information America database; www.informus.com, which primarily conducts direct public-records searches for 1,000 businesses and employers; Advanced Research Inc. (www.advsearch.com), which offers many checking services on a contingency basis (no hits, no charge), and www.digdirt.com, which says it has access to 325 billion records.", "Peoplewise, a 10-month-old privately held company (www.people-wise.com) in Hollister, Calif., has developed what it says is technology that allows the first real-time background checks.", "Employers can get information within seconds, even during an applicant's interview, said Gary Cornick, president of the company.", "Pre-employment screening must be fast, Cornick said.", "``In this labor market, you have to act quickly or you'll lose applicants to competitors,'' he added.", "But job applicants do have rights, especially under amendments to the Fair Credit Reporting Act that took effect on Sept. 30, 1997, extending the protection of the rules governing credit reports to job applicants.", "&QL; nn The changes give consumers more protection by requiring an employer to get applicants' permission before getting credit reports or other background checks on them.", "And if job applicants are turned down because of credit reports, the employer must tell the applicants about that as well as their right to free copies of the reports.", "The changes in the law also make it easier for job applicants to correct any errors found.", "More employers are doing background checks on job applicants because more courts are finding employers liable for not only the actions of employees, but also of former employees.", "``Legal requirements have increased the use of background checks by businesses,'' said Garry G. Mathiason, a senior partner with Littler, Mendelson, Fastiff, Tichy &AMP; Mathiason, an employment and labor law firm in San Francisco.", "``There are enough horror stories out there about criminal liability that employers feel it's become absolutely necessary.", "'' A Florida Circuit Court in 1995 found the Allstate Insurance Co. liable for failing to disclose the violent history of an employee it had dismissed.", "The Fireman's Fund Insurance Co. subsequently hired him, based on Allstate's recommendation, and he killed three co-workers there.", "Earlier this year, in Oakley vs. Flor-Shin Inc., the Kentucky Court of Appeals ruled that an employer could be held liable for an attack by an employee against a third party.", "In the case, a Kmart employee was accused of rape by an employee of Flor-Shin, the company the retailer had hired to clean floors.", "The victim sued Flor-Shin, saying it had known that the worker had a criminal history.", "Thirty-three states now require criminal background checks for workers in positions like health care, child care, schools and housekeeping.", "But few use Federal Bureau of Investigation records to check potential employees, so workers with criminal convictions can secure new jobs by simply crossing state lines, says a federal report issued Sept. 14 by the federal Health and Human Services Department.", "The report, which focused chiefly on nursing-home practices, calls for a national registry of workers with criminal backgrounds that would be accessible to employers.", "``Background checks today are more critical than ever before,'' said Lynda Lucas, president and chief financial officer of the Stores Protective Association.", "``In a society where the term `going postal' is routinely coined, I think if you asked most employees, they would want to be assured that the person working next to them wasn't a dangerous criminal.", "'' Of the nearly 300,000 screenings conducted by the association each year, fewer than 2 percent return ``hits'' _ findings that flag the applications as needing further checking _ and 1 percent of the hits turn up applicants with reports on file of criminal offenses, Ms. Lucas said.", "``In a day and age where it's hard to find qualified employees, you really don't want to turn people away if there's not a real good reason for doing so,'' said Barry Lawrence, a spokesman for the Society for Human Resource Management in Alexandria, Va.", "But checking applicants' records is quickly becoming routine for many companies.", "In a 1995 Society for Human Resource Management survey of 1,331 human-resource professionals, 92 percent said they spoke to former employers before hiring new employees, 78 percent called references provided by candidates, 61 percent verified educational backgrounds, 42 percent checked driving records, and 25 percent conducted credit checks.", "A 1994 survey of 589 members of the American Management Association in New York found that 70 percent conducted background checks on applicants and 48 percent searched criminal records.", "Employers do background checks in various ways _ using the telephone, fax or Internet, for example.", "But Alan F. Westin, a professor emeritus of public law and government at Columbia University and publisher of the Privacy and American Business newsletter, said: ``I don't believe there's any documented place to find out for sure who's relying on the Internet sources and who's not.", "No one tracks it.", "'' When employers check applicants' resumes, they find that quite a few are lying.", "About one-third of all resumes have inaccuracies, and 10 percent of those are serious enough to deny employment, estimated Edward C. Andler, owner and president of the Certified Reference Checking Co. in St. Louis, who has provided reference and resume checking for employers since 1987.", "``Over the years, the incidence of resume distortion has continued to creep up,'' said Andler, who is the author of ``The Complete Reference Checking Handbook'' (Amacom, 1998).", "``People are more willing to lie and stretch the truth.", "'' Andler estimated that one of every 12 applicants _ even those who are seeking executive-level positions _ will claim to have college degrees they do not have.", "Many employers have adopted a policy of giving only basic employment information when asked for references on former employees because they fear lawsuits.", "Lawrence said, ``Employers are frustrated because they can't always get the specific information they need to make a hiring decision.", "'' Westin said background checks were most likely to hurt applicants' chances unfairly when employers conducted hasty checks using sources that were not reliable, many of them inexpensive checking services offered on the Internet.", "``No one is tracking what the employer's checking on these Net services,'' Westin said.", "&QL; nn Small companies may turn to unreliable pre-employment checking services because they may not know about reputable services or may consider them too expensive, some experts say.", "``This is not the way the IBMs of the world check up on people,'' Westin said.", "``But it tends to be the impression many employees have.", "The most potential for problems will be with smaller employers, not the big guys.", "'' If a check turns up questionable online information, employment lawyers say, it should be corroborated by other sources, like public records.", "Mathiason cautioned, ``Electronic information can be wrong and to rely upon it blindly is unwise.", "'' Groups concerned with privacy rights say mistakes in reporting personal data happen routinely.", "But while Kelly had a hard time countering erroneous information that came up in background checks in the early 1990s, people applying for jobs can easily find out now if inaccurate negative information is keeping them from employment, and they can take steps to correct any errors.", "Katrina Haines, 27, a resident of Mission Viejo, Calif., found herself doing just that.", "She applied in May for a sales job with Good Guys, an electronics retailer in Brisbane, Calif. She did not get the job because of the results of a criminal records check in California conducted by the Amherst Group on behalf of Good Guys, she said.", "The check turned up arrest records for criminal prostitution and drug possession, but those records were incorrect.", "``It was so ridiculous, it was laughable,'' she said.", "``But it was no joke.", "'' The police record, Ms. Haines discovered, belonged to a person with the same name.", "She was given a copy of the report, as required by the Fair Credit Reporting Act, so she disputed the errors, which were corrected.", "She said she was now eligible to reapply to Good Guys.", "``If people don't know that they have the right to request the details of their own report and the ability to dispute it,'' Ms. Haines said, ``they'll never know why they didn't get a job.", "'' The concern over such mistakes in employment records has spawned a cottage industry of do-your-own-search services that, for a fee, will scout out the data available about you from public records and references.", "Documented Reference Check, for example, at www.badreferences.com, advertises that it will call an applicant's previous employer, asking for a reference as if the applicant had applied for a job.", "The company uses one of several corporate names when making such inquiries.", "It sends the former employee a confidential report, generally for a fee of $87.95.", "If negative comments are discovered, (justified or not, it says) the company offers to ask the former employer in a letter to stop passing on bad references to prospective employers.", "When errors in records are found, said Deirdre Mulligan, a staff counsel for the Center for Democracy and Technology in Washington, ``the only way to correct records is to go back to the original source of the information.", "'' At times, she said, that can be a lengthy process.", "Faced with the problem that background checks sometimes turn up inaccurate information, employers have to try to balance their need to screen job applicants with the rights of prospective employees.", "The problems have increased with the growth of online background-checking services.", "``There is no easy solution,'' said Norman G. Magnuson, vice president of public affairs for Associated Credit Bureaus, a 642-member trade association in Washington whose members generate 650 million credit reports a year, speaking about the growing reliance on electronic databases.", "``We're trying to integrate a new delivery method for information, but maybe we're just not ready for it.", "'' Lawrence, of the Society for Human Resource

Vice President Al Gore made public a list of a dozen or so new initiatives that seek to tighten the security of financial and medical records and to protect the privacy of children who use the Internet.", "Many of the proposals are simply endorsements of bills already wending their way through Congress.", "Others require new congressional action that is, in some cases, uncertain at best.", "But the administration chose not to offer any broad new ideas for protecting the privacy of adults online, an issue important to many in Congress and to public-interest groups.", "Gore announced instead that, for now, the administration would leave industry to regulate itself.", "The government's privacy rules are of special concern now because the European Union plans to enforce a new electronic privacy program in October and has threatened to stop doing business with companies in other countries that have looser rules.", "In congressional testimony earlier this week, Commerce Secretary William Daley said the administration's new proposals would bring the United States into compliance.", "But some experts in privacy law disagree.", "The administration can enforce only a handful of the initiatives proposed Friday, including two that would tighten the security of medical and banking records.", "The White House said the Department of Health and Human Services would propose a new rule next week to enhance the security of electronic medical records, but offered no details.", "And federal bank regulators will strengthen the enforcement of a law that sets limits on how easily banks can share information about their customers and their accounts with related business, such as insurance companies, according to a senior administration official.", "The goal, Gore said, was ``to ensure that account-holders have the chance to give a thumbs-down or a thumbs-up before banks hand out sensitive information about their accounts.", "'' Many of the other proposals are just that _ ideas that are up to others to implement.", "For example, Gore said he wanted to discourage ``profiling'' _ the practice by some companies of building dossiers on the activities of private citizens using a variety of databases and then using or selling that information to other businesses.", "``We are working with the Federal Trade Commission to issue a new challenge to companies that use information technology to piece together personal profiles of American citizens and then sell those profiles for profit,'' the vice president said.", "``And here is the message to them: If you don't find a way quickly to effectively regulate your own industry, we will take actions to make you protect the privacy of all Americans.", "'' Similarly, the White House urged Congress to pass pending legislation that would enforce criminal penalties for ``identity theft'' _ stealing someone's Social Security number, credit-card numbers or other identifiers and using them to commit a crime, such as credit-card fraud.", "Gore also urged Congress to pass a law that would forbid companies running sites on the World Wide Web to collect information about children under 13 visiting the sites without permission from their parents.", "``Before children innocently forfeit personal information, parents should have a say,'' the vice president said.", "<ANNOTATION> (STORY CAN END HERE _

Hendricks, editor of the Privacy Times newsletter, said: ``In form and ceremony, it's a great day.", "But in substance this leaves a lot wanting.", "'' Sobel also said the proposals ``still leave us

lives of many innocent people with forged checks and fraudulent credit cards.", "The police said Santner had masterminded the biggest identity theft scam ever seen in San Francisco, with a ring of thieves who took names and Social Security numbers of other people and then created fraudulent paper trails.", "``These guys are artists,'' said San Francisco Police Inspector Earl Wismer.", "Santner

after Mount St. Helens literally blew its head off, more than a dozen lava eruptions built a rock dome inside the mountain's crater.", "That dome is now partially covered by a glacier, which is growing because the edges of the mountain crater shades snow and ice from summertime sun.", "USGS scientists will keep a close eye on their instruments, Major said, and if seismic activity levels off

used to indicate the likelihood of a volcanic eruption that could endanger life or property.", "The government scientists had earlier said they expected to see more small to moderate explosions after a series of earthquakes culminated in a plume of steam and ash on Friday, rising 10,000 feet into the air but posing no threat to health or safety.", "But on Saturday, the earthquakes intensified, and shortly after noon, the volcano emitted a brief burst of steam, which was followed by a continuous, low-frequency tremor that lasted 50 minutes, believed to be caused by the movement of magma, or molten rock, underground.", "That suddenly created a more serious situation at Mount St. Helens, the most active volcano in the lower 48 states.", "But scientists said they did not expect an eruption on the magnitude of the May 1980 explosion that killed 57 people and caused widespread destruction.", "Officials on Saturday evacuated an observatory five miles from the crater and warned that people with respiratory diseases could be affected if large amounts of ash became airborne.", "Hundreds of excited tourists who had flocked to Mount St. Helens in recent days were forced to move to a lookout point several miles below, causing a deep traffic jam on the one winding road that leads from this small town in southwestern Washington up to the mountain.", "The 2,100 residents of this town and others near the mountain, however, were not evacuated.", "Officials, including Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton, who held a news conference Saturday afternoon in nearby Vancouver, Wash., said their houses were far enough away -- 30 miles to the west -- to be safe.", "\"This is red alert,\" Norton said, adding, \"Overall, we are very fortunate that no one lives directly in the area that would be most impacted.", "\" C. Daniel Miller, a scientist at the U.S. Geological Survey, said he expected an eruption \"larger than what we saw on Friday, probably by quite a bit.", "\" The 50-minute tremor \"is the kind of seismic signal that occurs not when rock is breaking, but when magma is actually moving up in the throat of the volcano,\" Miller said at a news conference Saturday evening.", "\"That's the sort of thing that frankly sends a chill up the back of a volcanologist,\" he said.", "Scientists said Saturday that they saw more signs of deformation at the south side of the lava dome, a half-mile wide, 925-foot high bulge at the center of the volcano's crater.", "The crew aboard a helicopter taking measurements on Saturday reported the smell of rotten eggs, probably hydrogen sulfide emanating from magma.", "Until then, scientists had not detected significant amounts of volcanic gases.", "Gas-rich magma is more likely to erupt explosively.", "The greatest danger was expected to be potentially large ash plumes, which could shoot tens of thousands of feet up.", "The ash could be accompanied by lava flow and possibly blow much farther northwest, depending on the weather, and cause health problems for anyone with asthma or other respiratory diseases, said Dr. Thomas Pierson, a geologist with the geological survey.", "And if the mountain glacier melted as a result of an eruption, it could create a \"debris flow\" cascading down the mountain, officials said.", "The earthquakes recorded over the past week, subsiding briefly after the Friday explosion, were the most intense seismic activity on the mountain since before the massive May 1980 eruption, which killed 57 people and caused widespread destruction.", "Before Friday, the mountain had been dormant for 18 years.", "Scientists said they had initially expected any eruption to be fairly minor, but were now saying it could be more serious.", "Castle Rock residents, many of whom witnessed the 1980 explosion, which dumped truckloads of ash on this town, seemed to be taking the new development in stride and expressed little worry on Saturday, saying nothing could compare to the 1980 event.", "\"I know it might sound like the strangest thing

Sept. 23 than it has at any point since its devastating May 18, 1980, eruption, which killed 57 people and coated much of the Northwest with ash.", "But scientists expect the impending eruption to be

in Seattle.", "Interior Secretary Gale Norton, who flew over the mountain Saturday, said the seismic activity has weakened the 1,000-foot (300-meter) lava dome that began forming in the volcano's crater after the 1980 eruption.", "Norton said the chances of an eruption or lava flow have increased, and that the volcano most likely will see moderate ash eruptions.", "\"The greatest concern at

that new magma is probably entering the volcano's upper levels, possibly bringing with it volatile gases that could lead to eruptions, said Bill Steele at the University of Washington's seismic laboratory in Seattle.", "Explosions from the crater could occur without warning, possibly throwing rock onto the flanks of the volcano, the USGS said in a news release.", "Still, scientists said the

at the U.S. Geological Survey's Cascades Volcanic Observatory in Vancouver, Washington, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) south.", "The 1980 eruption reamed open the route to the surface, and for six years smaller eruptions piled lava into the massive dome that marks the main conduit for magma.", "Friday's relatively small eruption, which generated a plume of ash and smoke 16,000 feet (4,800 meters) high, was the first since a 1986 dome-building event at the volcano.", "Scientists had believed the recent flurry of shallow earthquakes may reflect movement of magma that came up the volcano's pipe during a 1998 swarm of quakes, but Pierson said Saturday's activity suggested at least some new magma was involved, making a larger explosion more likely.", "Air sampling had detected only tiny amounts of the volcanic gases that new magma produces, but scientists said the gases could be sealed inside the system or have been dissolved by water on the mountain.", "The volcano holds a 600-foot (180-meter)-deep glacier.", "Melting of the glacier could trigger debris flows down onto the barren pumice plain at the foot of the mountain, the USGS said, noting a \"very low probability\"

with fear they were in the weeks and days leading up to the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, the volcano that rained utter havoc from 30 miles away on this tiny town.", "But 24 years later, as scientists warn of a new, imminent eruption, the fear has not returned.", "For one, scientists do not believe the eruption will be nearly as powerful.", "But also, residents now know the drill, the evacuation routes and the ways to protect themselves and their property from heavy ash fall.Residents are slightly nervous but mostly aggravated at all the local traffic, caused by the thousands of tourists, reporters and entrepreneurs headed through town over the last few days on their way to a lookout point on the mountain.", "In 1980, once scientists knew that powerful earthquakes were stirring Mount St. Helens, few people were visiting the mountain.", "Now, a spot at the Castle Lake Lookout parking lot is a rare commodity.", "And far from running away, people like Denise Horton, who lives 130 miles away in Sandy, Ore., are traveling hours to get here, bursting with anticipation for the eruption.", "\"It's like waiting for a parade that's late,\" said Horton, who opened a hot dog stand on the mountain, selling mostly to reporters who were among the dozens camped out at the lookout point.", "\"It's like waiting for a baby.", "\" The fact that they are here is testament to the vast forecasting gains of scientists, who are armed with new technology and skills honed from the 1980 eruption, which killed 57 people, obliterated 200 houses and spawned worldwide interest in the study of volcanoes.", "Seismometers pinpoint the tiny earthquakes that have been shaking Mount St. Helens for the past week and a half.", "Global positioning system sensors detect outward bulges as slight as a fraction of an inch.", "Instruments aboard a helicopter sniff out gases seeping out of the rocks below and identify hot spots.", "\"There's really been a revolution,\" said Dr. William E. Scott of the U.S. Geological Survey's Cascades Volcano Observatory in Vancouver, Wash., which is monitoring the mountain and holding twice-daily news conferences.", "But for all their high-tech gadgetry, scientists still do not have a direct way to answer the questions they most want to answer: Where is the molten rock beneath the volcano?", "And where is it going?", "\"We don't know where it is,\" said William Steele, a seismologist at the University of Washington.", "The expectation is that magma -- underground molten rock -- will reach the surface and spill out as lava and that there will be more eruptions like the small one that happened Friday, or larger.", "\"Something could happen at any time, basically,\" Scott said at a news conference on Sunday afternoon.", "Or, he said, \"It may stall out and we may never see it.", "\" That would disappoint Kathy Teas, who was living nearby in 1980 and was evacuated from her home.", "Teas later moved to Oregon, but on Sunday she was back, having spent the previous night at a campsite on the mountain, eager to see an eruption.", "\"Here I am at 52 and I'm back here again,\" she said.", "\"To have the opportunity to witness this is something I can't pass up.", "\" From the pattern of seismic shakings before and after the 1980 eruption, seismologists laboriously constructed a fuzzy picture of the volcano's workings, the equivalent of a prenatal sonogram.", "It indicated a deep magma chamber about four miles underground and a shallower one perhaps a mile below the crater.", "But unlike hurricanes, which allow meteorologists to make detailed observations by airplanes and satellites, a volcano eruption develops mostly out of sight, hundreds to thousands of feet underground.", "\"We can't take measurements in the interior,\" said Dr. Anthony Qamar, a professor of geophysics at the University of Washington.", "Information like the volcano's internal temperatures and pressures can only be guessed at.", "Instruments on or hovering above the surface offer only indirect suggestions of what is happening.", "Volcanologists must sift through competing plausible explanations for what they observe and what they do not.", "Thus, when a new event occurs, like the continuous, 50-minute, low-frequency tremor on Saturday, the scientists sometimes need to quickly revise their thoughts.", "The swarms of earthquakes, a few a minute, have been interpreted as the breaking of rocks by the buildup of pressure.", "The tremor -- accompanied by a cessation in the earthquakes -- suggested that the magma had broken through and was rising smoothlyleading scientists to suspect an eruption might be imminent.", "After the tremor ended, the earthquakes resumed.", "At 3 a.m. Sunday, a second tremor occurred, this time lasting 25 minutes.", "Again, the seismic activity died down, then picked up.", "Through the day on Sunday, the intensity of the earthquakes diminished somewhat.", "\"The larger earthquakes have dropped off,\" Qamar said.", "That could mean the pressure had lessened, and the volcano was quieting down.", "Or it could mean that the magma had broken through the rock blockage and was now pushing its way toward the surface.", "Or it could just be a lull.", "\"We're not interpreting much about that decrease,\" Scott said.", "What has been unusual about the current episode is that all of the earthquakes have been shallow, within half a mile or so of the surface.", "That leaves scientists wondering whether magma is rising from the deep chamber or whether the magma driving the tremors and eruptions is left over from six years ago.", "Then, as now, a swarm of earthquakes shook the area, and scientists believe that magma rose upward beneath the crater, although nothing broke through as an eruption.", "Whether the magma is new or old is important, because that could determine whether the eruptions will explosively shoot clouds of ash that spread over a large area or, less catastrophically, just push out lava.", "\"The analogy is the old Coke can that you shake up and open,\" Scott said.", "\"If you shake it a whole lot and pop it open, you're going to get a lot of frothing and it's going to be an explosive event.", "But if you pour it in a glass and let the gas come out and then you try to shake the glass, you can't get as much fizz.", "\" Once scientists realized this weekend that an eruption could be imminent, spectators were ordered to leave an observatory five miles from the crater.", "But lookout points farther away were not considered to be in danger.", "Here in Toutle (pronounced TOOT-el), a town of 700 that is the closest to the mountain, many residents said that while they were not panicking, they were concerned about an eruption causing a mudflow into the three nearby rivers, which were flooded and full of floating debris in 1980.", "\"All I can say is you better learn to respect it,\" Karen Meyers, 43, who lives in Toutle and witnessed the 1980 eruption.", "\"I mean, last time, their worst-case scenario didn't even come close to what happened here.", "Mother Nature is going to win and you'll pay hell trying to predict

arrive at Newark International Airport from Guinea on Thursday morning.", "She had been expected Tuesday, but had to cancel her flight because the U.S. Embassy in the Guinean capital of Conakry was unexpectedly closed Monday and she was not able to pick up her visas.", "The parents, who are divorced, were last in New York in early February, when they came to collect their son's body for burial in Guinea and found that his death had set off a storm of political protest that has yet to abate.", "Diallo, a 22-year-old immigrant who worked as a street peddler in Manhattan and attended computer

shooting, a battle is already taking shape over physical evidence in the case, as lawyers and experts seek to buttress their own versions of what happened based on entrance wounds, bullet trajectories and other forensic details.", "Since there were apparently no eyewitnesses who saw the whole incident except for the officers, such evidence _ and the often fuzzy or conflicting interpretations it can yield _ could be a crucial element in the officers' trial on murder charges.", "Both sides hope to use forensic evidence to answer vexing questions that have loomed since Feb. 4, when Diallo was killed in fusillade of 41 bullets fired into the vestibule of his Bronx apartment building.", "Where was he when the four plainclothes officers began shooting?", "How quickly did he fall?", "Is there anything at the crime scene to explain why the officers unleashed such firepower at an unarmed man?", "The potential significance of the forensic evidence is apparent in the efforts being expended by all sides to collect it: _ The Police Department's Internal Affairs Bureau has done an extensive re-enactment of the shooting at the department's firing range.", "_ The FBI dispatched a team of ballistic experts from Washington who spent days making measurements of the crime scene and traced bullet trajectories with lasers.", "_ Defense lawyers have employed their own set of crime-scene specialists who may be called to rebut whatever theories the prosecution's experts propose.", "_ The Diallo family has employed a pathologist whose autopsy has led to charges by their lawyers that the West African immigrant was shot repeatedly, even after he had collapsed, paralyzed, from his initial wounds.", "``The forensic evidence is critical to the case because it is the forensic evidence that offers the best challenge to the credibility of the four police officers,'' said Peter Neufeld, a lawyer for the Diallo family, which is planning to bring a civil suit in the case.", "``You can question their story based on common sense and logic and what passersby might have seen or heard.", "But none of that can be as devastating an impeachment as objective, irrefutable scientific evidence.", "'' Not surprisingly, the officers' lawyers embrace the same irrefutable science to argue a opposite position.", "``I am not afraid of the forensic evidence,'' said Stephen Worth, the attorney for Officer Edward McMellon, one of the four accused of second-degree murder.", "``What the forensic evidence will not show is that these officers fired repeatedly into a prone body.", "Quite the contrary, I expect it to show the opposite, that, namely, the vast majority of the shots, if not all of the shots, were fired at a standing person.", "'' Of course, it is far from certain that a verdict in the case will hinge on forensic evidence.", "Assuming the officers testify, their credibility in asserting that they feared for their lives in the mistaken belief that Diallo was armed could also be a decisive factor.", "But it seems likely that a dizzying parade of expert witnesses will take the stand at the trial to debate the trigonometric calculation of bullet trajectories, and more importantly, to contradict one another.", "``Ideally, the physical evidence should support one conclusion,'' said Peter R. De Forest, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice.", "``But what often happens is that one side or the other pays someone to dispute it and the science gets polluted.", "'' The Bronx district attorney's office has declined to comment on details of the evidence or how it might be used in the trial.", "But the Diallo family lawyers have shown no such reticence, virtually constructing a criminal case against the officers while preparing the civil suit.", "One of the central disputes will likely focus on the officers' assertion that Diallo continued to stand upright, even after he had been hit by many of the 19 bullets that struck him.", "There are apparently no eyewitnesses to confirm or rebut that account, although several of Diallo's neighbors on Wheeler Avenue have said they saw a portion of the incident and heard the shooting.", "But the Diallo family's lawyers dismissed the officers' version as ``absurd,'' pointing to an autopsy by their pathologist, Dr. Cyril H. Wecht of Pennsylvania, that suggests that Diallo was knocked down and paralyzed quite early in the barrage.", "``Amadou Diallo was already on the ground with his spinal cord severed,'' said the Rev.", "Al Sharpton, a family adviser, ``so the alibi they have put on the court record will devastate the defense.", "'' The official autopsy by the city Medical Examiner's office does not discuss the sequence of shots, the position of Diallo's body when he was hit or whether he was paralyzed at any point, people who have reviewed the report have said.", "The autopsy report does indicate that two shots, one from the front and one from the back, perforated Diallo's spine at separate points.", "Those perforations are the primary basis for the family's conclusion that he was paralyzed.", "Wecht's analysis that those shots came early in the sequence is based, in part, on the amount of blood from those wounds that filled his chest cavity.", "But Marvyn Kornberg, who represents Officer Sean Carroll, said the officers' semiautomatic weapons fired so fast that it is impossible to determine with any precision when the shots to the chest were fired.", "``You are talking about a matter of eight seconds,'' he said.", "``You can't tell which is first and which is second.", "Any medical examiner who testifies to that can expect some rigorous cross examination.", "'' A second set of bullets that struck Diallo's right leg and foot also figure to be a source of debate.", "The city's autopsy indicates that one shot struck Diallo just above the heel and traveled up the calf before lodging behind the knee, people who reviewed the report have said.", "The Diallo family's lawyers believe this bullet, as well as a second bullet that the autopsy says hit Diallo's middle toe ``adjacent to the front of the nail,'' indicate that Diallo was shot after he had fallen.", "Defense lawyers dispute that conclusion and argue that the incident took so little time that the officers most likely had no chance to gauge the impact of their initial shots as they fired subsequent rounds.", "There could also be a dispute over just how much time elapsed as the 41 shots were fired, especially since witnesses have said they heard a pause in the firing, apparently caused when Officer Edward McMellon fell down while firing.

have on the water supply to de la Cruz's village.", "But the Yanacocha mining company, 51-percent owned by Denver-based Newmont Mining Corp., still has a serious image problem to overcome.", "\"The mine here is interested only in money _ hauling off gold _ and nothing else,\" de la Cruz said.", "The blockade of the mine's access road was sparked by fears that new mining on Cerro Quilish, the

in Peruvian income tax, of which half goes to Cajamarca's government.", "In the last 11 years, Yanacocha independently financed the construction of 35 schools, built miles (kilometers) of road and

team.", "``This has taken the scientific world completely by surprise.", "'' Amphibians are under assault for three major reasons, according to the report.", "Habitat decline, from deforestation to water pollution and wetlands destruction, threatens them because the animals live both on land and in water.", "Over-harvesting of amphibians for food and medicine is a second threat.", "The third is more enigmatic, but it has resulted in catastrophic declines, often linked to a fungal disease called chytridiomycosis, particularly in cooler habitats that are experiencing drought.", "Surveys showed the amphibian population of Costa Rica's Monteverde Cloud Forest, for example, was stable until 1987.", "The next year it began to crash and by 1989, 40 percent of its amphibian species had gone extinct, including the striking golden toad.", "Stuart said it is now widely believed chytridiomycosis played a pivotal role in the devastation, which took place in a dry period.", "The fact that more than 200 amphibian species are showing rapid enigmatic declines is alarming, Stuart said, because it is probably linked to recent disruptions in rain and storm patterns.", "``This is a wake-up call to us that we don't have a grip on the massive climate change that's going on,'' he said.", "Humans are responsible for amphibians' decline in other regions of the world, including China, where many are sought as a delicacy.", "The Chinese giant salamander -- at six feet the largest amphibian in the world -- sells for at least $300 on the street and makes for several meals, and it has now disappeared from nearly all its range.", "In the United States, habitat destruction poses the biggest challenge.", "Developers and environmentalists are feuding in central California over the fate of the California tiger salamander, a striking black animal with yellow spots.", "A casualty of urbanization and agricultural development, federal officials estimate the salamander has lost 75 percent of its habitat over time.", "The U.S.", "Fish and Wildlife Service decided in July to list the salamander as threatened and identified 383,000 acres of habitat as key to its survival.", "Al Donner, an assistant field supervisor in Fish and Wildlife's Sacramento office, said federal officials are trying to ``be sensitive to the interests of all affected parties'' in the tiger salamander case, including developers, landowners and environmentalists, ``while working to ensure the survival of the species.", "'' Four years ago the federal government launched a national program to research and monitor the state of amphibians in the United States, and it now devotes $4 million a year to identify threats to amphibians nationwide.", "``We've had a leap in our understanding into the causes of amphibian decline,'' said Rick Kearney, national coordinator for the U.S. Geological Survey's amphibian research and monitoring initiative.", "``We recognize how there are connections between the decline in water quality (and availability) and amphibians.", "... Amphibians are a very important indicator of our environmental quality.", "'' But Paul Ehrlich, a Stanford University ecologist, said the amphibian study was worrying and showed that administration officials are ``destroying the working supports of our life system'' by exploiting rather than conserving habitat.", "``They're sawing off the limb that humanity is sitting on,'' Ehrlich said.", "``Without biodiversity we'd be dead.", "'' Gascon, at Conservation International, said ``there are some actions we can take today to prevent the immediate extinction of many species as we work on a longer term solution.", "'' These include creating parks and ecological reserves, working to reduce emissions that contribute to climate change and breeding animals in captivity in order to sustain vulnerable species.

factory in a decrepit industrial area of this capital, clouds of white smoke and acrid smells still hovered over the site Friday night.", "About a dozen Sudanese soldiers lounged on the ground at the entrance of the destroyed factory, which the Sudanese say made pharmaceuticals, but which the Americans contend was a cover for the making of chemical weapons.", "Deep puddles of water on the muddy ground attested to the fire-fighting efforts after the strike.", "The Islamic government, accused by the Clinton administration of assisting in the terrorist activities of Osama bin Laden, used these fiery remnants of the factory as a backdrop for a well-organized anti-American demonstration during the day.", "After Friday prayers in the city's mosques, worshipers were urged to attend rallies, including a particularly vocal one at the plant, where leading figures of the government accused the United States of being a ``terrorist'' state.", "At one rally, pictures of President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky were on prominent display, a juxtaposition of a man and his mistress that is interpreted in this very conservative society as the ultimate mockery.", "Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail said that Sudan would remain a ``tomb for its enemies whatever this costs us in human lives.", "'' But the most important Sudanese leader, Hassan al Turabi, who is the speaker of Parliament and the ideological power behind the ruling National Islamic Front, remained silent Friday.", "American intelligence officials have called Turabi a close comrade of bin Laden, whom the administration has accused of being the mastermind of the bombings of two American embassies in East Africa that left hundreds dead.", "Turabi has been a mysterious figure of the fundamentalist government, which grabbed power in the coup in 1989.", "Gen. Omar Hassan al-Bashir, the Sudanese president, made up for Turabi's silence.", "Bashir said that he would prove that the pharmaceutical plant hit by the American missiles was not a cover for making the precursors of nerve gas as Washington claimed.", "``We have undeniable proof'' that the plant was only used for pharmaceutical products such as children's and anti-malarial medicines, he said.", "International companies that had provided equipment for the plant that opened two years ago would back him up, he added.", "The general did not name them.", "In describing the reasons for destroying the plant, Sandy Berger, Clinton's national security adviser, said bin Laden had given key financial help for the plant that was part of the ``Sudanese military industrial complex.", "'' Bin Laden lived in Sudan from 1994 to 1996, a period when Washington says he invited international terrorists to train at camps here.", "He was forced to leave Sudan in 1996 when the government decided that he was too much of an embarrassment and his presence too costly.", "After telling bin Laden to leave, the government hoped to win some concessions from the Clinton administration, including economic aid, but failed to do so.", "As part of its case that the plant was a benign operation, government officials said that it was owned by a Sudanese businessman, Salah Idrisse, who is also a citizen of Saudi Arabia.", "The heart of the factory where most of the smoke was still billowing was off bounds to reporters Friday and it was impossible to tell what was made there.", "In the rubble at the front of the compound were wrappers from a veterinary solution made at the plant and leaflets on how to take Profenil, a trade name for ibuprofen, a widely used pain reliever.", "Trays of small empty brown bottles, apparently used for medicine, were scattered about on the ground.", "Mohammed Hussein, 23, a builder who lives about a mile from the plant, said he saw bright lights and then heard the swoosh of about six missiles during the attack.", "At first, he thought the nearby power station had been struck, he said.", "Then he thought a plane had crashed.", "Then, he said, it occurred to him that John Garang, the leader of a southern rebel group that has been waging a civil war for more than a decade, had finally struck the capital.", "According to the plant's managing director, Sayed Hamed, the factory employed 360 workers.", "He said the enterprise made 30 varieties of drugs for humans, and 23 kinds of veterinary medicines.", "A hospital spokesman said earlier that 10 people wounded from the strike were admitted to the wards.", "Four of them were critically hurt, he said.", "The plant does not operate at night and there were apparently few workers around during the attack.", "A spokesman for Sudanese opposition political parties based in Cairo, Faruq Ahmed Adam, said he agreed with Washington that the plant was a cover for the manufacture of chemical weapons.", "He said that another factory in the suburb of Kafouri also made chemical weapons.", "He added that Sudanese security forces were investors in the plant.", "Relations between Washington and the Sudanese government have gone from bad to worse in the nine years of the fundamentalist regime.", "But even so, ordinary people seem to be bewildered why American should send cruise missiles here.", "Some said they were skeptical that the pharmaceutical plant was a cover for preparing chemical warfare agents.", "``Most people here, even those who are anti-government, do not believe this particular factory was making chemical weapons,'' one man said.", "But another longtime opposition supporter, a lawyer, said he believed the Americans knew what they were doing.", "``Bin Laden has never built a factory for

Blake tried to have Bakley arrested and her pregnancy aborted so that he would not have to marry her.", "After their marriage in November 2000, Blake solicited two Hollywood stuntmen to kill her.",

years after Bakley's killing, Hambleton's earlier legal woes, the dearth of forensic evidence and a book author who shadowed homicide detectives during the investigation of Bakley's murder.", "As early as the night of Bakley's murder, Blake ``did some suspicious things'' that led detectives at the scene to focus on him as a possible suspect, Samuels said.", "She said a husband fearing for his

graphic pictures of sexual humiliation of prisoners at the jail near Baghdad, told the hearing she had been following the orders of her former boyfriend, Specialist Charles Graner, one of the abuse ringleaders.", "\"I assumed it was okay because he was an MP and he had the background of being a corrections officer,\" said England, who pled guilty to seven charges relating to the abuse of prisoners in October and November 2003.", "The military judge, Colonel James Pohl, halted proceedings after England indicated that she did not believe her actions were wrong.", "\"I want you to understand this is your trial.", "I don't want you to plead guilty unless you are guilty,\" Pohl said.", "England told how she was at the prison to visit friends and Graner had taken her into the cellblock where he was trying to get an uncooperative inmate out of his cell.", "\"The detainee was on the ground,\" England said.", "\"He (Graner) proceeded to tie the strap around his neck and he told the detainee to start crawling around the cell.", "When the detainee would not do that he had me hold the strap.", "\" The prisoner then crawled out of the cell with England holding the strap.", "When the judge asked England why Graner handed her the strap, England replied: \"He wanted it to look more degrading with a female of my size.", "\" Graner had also wanted other prisoners to witness the degradation.", "\"It would be more humiliating to him.", "\" England said she believed Graner took the pictures \"for his own amusement.", "\" The abuse pictures were shown around the world and led to widespread condemnation of US practices in Iraq at a time when it was still trying to bring the country under control after the 2003 invasion.", "England reached a plea bargain with military prosecutors, who dropped a dereliction of duty charge and one of committing an indecent act when she was photographed performing fellatio on another solider.", "That brings the maximum sentence she risks down to 11 years from the original 16-and-a-half years.", "Her defense asked the judge to roll several maltreatment charges into one, which would bring the maximum sentence down to eight years.", "England's lawyer, Rick Hernandez, asked Pohl to recuse himself because he had presided over all the other Abu Ghraib abuse cases.", "Hernandez said this \"gives the appearance of bias.", "\" But the judge rejected the demand and England went on to make her plea.", "The proposed punishment under the plea bargain with prosecutors will remain secret until after the military jury decides the

holding a leash, England is also seen pointing to the word \"rapeist\" (sic) written on the exposed buttocks of a prisoner.", "She also posed with naked prisoners who formed a human pyramid and some who had been forced to masturbate.", "She was also photographed engaging in fellatio with Graner, the father of her newborn baby, who is serving a 10-year jail term for beating and sexually humiliating prisoners.", "Graner is reported to have married another soldier charged in the scandal, Megan Ambuhl, who pleaded guilty and received a dishonorable discharge.", "Of the eight soldiers charged over the Abu Ghraib scandal, only Graner's case has gone to trial.", "Five soldiers pled guilty and received sentences ranging from a dishonorable discharge to eight years in prison.", "The final hearing, that of Specialist Sabrina Harman, is scheduled to begin May 11.", "A number of US investigations categorized the abuse as the isolated acts by a small group.", "But many groups have raised suspicions that the US administration has protected the upper ranks.", "US rights groups have called for a special prosecutor to look into torture allegations.", "Some top officers have received nonjudicial punishment, including Brigadier General Janis Karpinski, commander of the military police unit at Abu Ghraib, was relieved of her command and reprimanded.", "The senior US

of the missing teen, not seen since the early morning hours of May 30, is about to be solved -- nor are Aruba's image woes.", "In the past week authorities released the first two suspects arrested in the case, then arrested a fourth Friday.", "They staged a highly-publicized spectacle of a search of a beach where a local DJ claimed to have found a pair of women's underwear and condoms.", "They searched the island by helicopter using infrared technology.", "On Saturday night -- in a scene that seemed to sum up every bizarre aspect of the investigation and press frenzy -- TV crews chased Paulus Van Der Sloot, a judge, and the father of one of four detained suspects in the case, Joran Van Der Sloot, 17.", "The elder Van Der Sloot was coming out of the downtown Oranjestad police station, where he had been brought for questioning in connection with the case.", "Seeing the camera crews, he broke into a sprint and a cameraman for CNN caught up to him as he frantically tried to

dented Aruba's image as the safest island in the Caribbean.", "\"I can run you through the list of things we've been misportrayed of, fantastical things, from a high level government cover-up, to drug cartel, to prostitution and slavery,\" said Trappenberg.", "\" We are not Pirates of the Caribbean.", "\" Through the weekend CNN and FOX -- each with crews of about 10 -- showed few signs of losing

outside the courthouse to hoping to get a shot of a suspect leaving, and a what usually turns out to be a no-comment from lawyers and prosecutors.", "On Monday, the latest suspect, tour boat disc jockey Steve Croes, 26, is expected to come before a judge who will rule whether prosecutors have enough information to hold him on suspicion of premeditated murder, murder, and kidnapping with fatal

hospitality, not hostility,\" he said.", "\"Nothing like this ever happens and people just don't know how to cope with it.", "They are extremely concerned about Natalee and her family, but everybody is affected.", "People can't sleep.", "It's terrible.", "\" As FOX and CNN have pushed to scoop each they have both made missteps.", "At one point a week ago there were reports of a body found, a

story.", "The tabloid TV show \"A Current Affair\" plans to air an entire program on Aruba on Monday.", "The National Enquirer had a reporter on the island all week researching a piece.", "Authorities point to the island's crime statistics -- one murder and six rapes were recorded on Aruba last year -- as an evidence that Holloway's disappearance is out of character for an island renowned as one of the safest places on earth.", "As much as the media obsession has distorted perceptions of the island, the authorities reluctance to release information has fueled speculation and disconnect.", "It's not clear how the latest suspect, Steve Croes, is involved.", "The Associated Press reported that Croes might have known one of the suspects, Deepak Kalpoe, through meeting him at an internet cafe,
